"I played for about an hour. First deer appears at the 45 minute mark. Guess what? It's a female. I don't have a license to hunt female white tail. Said whatever, aimed at it anyways. Point, click, nothing. Misfire, apparently this simulator has a no kill what you can't legally kill policy. I thought maybe I would be fined, or lose some funds, but no, just wont let me shoot it.  -rep, boring as hell. If i wanted to really wait that long i would be outside, not on a pc gam",neg
"Team Fortress 2 is really the Best Action game i ever played on. im still playing it because like Left 4 dead 2 its fun,spending bored times and you can also play some awesome,cool,funny 9 characters each one with his own tricks and this game is also the Paradise of Hats/Weapons/Miscs/Genuine/Vintage/Strange/Unusuals everything you ever wanted is here.My most favorite Characters are the Scout/Pyro/Soldier/Spy.Best game i ever played on Steam!!Rating:10/10",pos
"I am old as dirt, have played this game 4k+ hrs. It still fells new with every new char, every new challenge league. Our guild now has 28 members, spread over the whole world (of which I am the humble leader). Play it with friends, new or old, preferably over Skype or Teamspeak.Join a guild if your old friends don't get it, or make your own guild and invite people you find nice in the game.  The community is mostly very nice. Immature (not young-age has nothing to do with it) or cocky players tend to quit, cause the learning treshold is quite high. Be nice ingame, and you will get all the help you need. Global chat can be a way to meet other players (or get trolled if you are unlucky), or just throw in some questions if you trade.To summarise: PoE is a game that never gets old. Frustrating as hell sometimes, for sure, but never boring.",pos
"penthouse side : 2 should be the title of this Treyarch title because it is literal♥♥♥♥♥♥ there are no killstreaks for one, (1- ) and microsoft really dropped the ball by not letting u be a gangster in this one.  the multiplayer in this game is a complete letdown bc there is no dlc, but onto the SINGLE player : you play as a grandma living in ancient rome during the roman emnpire ruling of rome era and due to the oppression from greek alexander the great you cant have sex with other old men and the entire game you go around collecting collectables and flying helicopters and there are no dogs like there should be as such in call of duty and the guns are unbalanced9/11 it was the bomb gameinformer",pos
"No. Not this game. 350 hours played and nothing but frustraytion. Balance once you're out of tier 1 is joke especially with American tanks. Want historical accuracy? Well! You got it. One of the most broken tank, T-34, is broken in alll aspect compared to reality. Ever see a T-34 bounce an APDS from the Conqueror? This game literally says ♥♥♥♥ You to players with non-russian vehicle.Also Gaijin seems to release new contents A LOT, but misses out on fixing current balance and bugs currently ingame. Things that exist years ago are not fixed. Not to mention their horrible server. In Battle.net I get 50 pings playing in American server from Asia. In War Thunder I get 100 ping playing in Asain server.I can keep ranting for a lot longer, but this is enough.",neg

"Early Access ReviewF2P model CCG which is (currently) generous to the player, providing rewards from constructed and draft style play against scaling AI, as well as versus other human players. This makes the game very accessible to players that are new to the genre and want to learn different deck archetypes, how to build constructed decks, and draft without having to fork out real money to do so, which is quite a frustrating experience in other games. The combat system is more like Magic than Hearthstone, allowing satisfying board interaction by both players.",pos
"Early Access ReviewOur team was losing. The enemy team had already captured most of the checkpoints. One more capture, and they would be able to attack our home base. We stood at the last checkpoint and formulated a plan. Our tanker, with a slow but powerful ship was ordered to solo mid and weaken the enemy ships a little. Me and another guy, as we were both hunters were to attack from above and below to engage the enemy fleet while our two snipers were to position themselves near the checkpoint and attack from afar. As we finished up our plan, we waited for the coming battle. Soon enough, the enemy fleet had arrived and began approaching the last checkpoint. We charged into battle, Our tanker approached the enemy first and began blasting the enemys ships. Me and my fellow hunter joined our tanker and began attacking the fleet while our sniper provided support from long range. After a long battle, we emerged victorious but suffered two losses. Our tanker and my fellow hunter were taken down during the fight. As we looked at the empty battlefield, we knew we had only delayed our demise but for now we enjoyed a fleeting victory and began planning our next defense",pos
"To start, I should say that war thunder has been a positive influence on my life overall. When the community is good, it's great! I've formed many lasting friendships, and I'm currently in a relationship of almost a year with someone I met through the game.But war thunder has a problem with women. Not all players are like that--not even the majority. But enough ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are loud enough to ruin the experience for so many girls I know, and we as a community can do better.I'm a woman. I like to play comp, and I get on voice to make call-outs and provide encouragement. For the most part, it's fine and we all have a good time (except when the enemy J1 somehow gets me every push.) But there are times when teammates get toxic in a way that doesn't get applied to male players. And sometimes the very presence of a female voice in the chat is enough to set people off--it's not funny when you ask me if I'll send nudes, or if I'll perform an obscene act for you. (Even if you're ""joking,"" it's really not funny, I promise.) It's grating to be continually asked if I'm a bomber main since I'm a girl, or for you to demand that I pocket you. (I don't play bomber. Sorry. How about naval planes?)It's especially not funny to be harassed, to have people make videos of them ""trolling"" me (and to receive dozens of hateful messages after), to be told to kill myself, to be called a bimbo and a♥♥♥♥♥♥and much, much worse. I've blocked people who then make multiple accounts to continually harass me. When playing with my girlfriend, we've been called all kinds of sexist epithets, plus an extra helping of homophobia when they find out we're dating.And despite all this, I still get on mic and speak. Partly because I'm not about to let a few sweaty manchildren ruin my gaming experience, but partly because it's more than just me. Time and time again, I've had other girls timidly get on mic when they hear my voice and express their relief at hearing another girl. They say they don't usually talk out of fear, but that it's nice to hear a friendly voice. People say that there aren't any girl gamers, but that couldn't be further from the truth--you've just create a climate where they're too scared to talk, because many of them have experienced the same things as me.I know most of you are decent people. I'm lucky to have a close circle of players who are talented, kind people. But we as a community need to do a better job of standing up against this kind of poor behavior. More than just reporting it when you see it (although I wholly recommend doing that): make it known that you don't tolerate sexist conduct. Even a simple ""hey man, that's not cool"" can both (1) let the harasser know that their behavior isn't condoned and (2) let the harassee know that decent people do exist. The silence of complicity and the silence of dissent sound the same--speak up to make your true colors shine.So please: be mindful, foster an environment that welcomes female players, and don't forget to bomb the airfield!ETA: Thanks for the (mostly) supportive response, I appreciate it! It means a lot to me that the average person still knows how to be polite. Like I said, it's the good eggs who make this community what it is.A couple people have said things akin to ""this is the internet, grow a thicker skin, etc."" I'm well aware of how the internet can be, and I do have a tremendously thicc skin as a result. It's not me I'm worried about; a lot of people don't have such a thicc skin, and it's those girls who aren't as hardened as I am who really suffer. Just because I'm a hardened shrew doesn't mean we all have to be.People have also said things akin to ""if you don't want to be subject to homophobic harassment when you're playing with your girlfriend, you shouldn't announce to people that you guys are dating."" Aside from putting the blame on me (which I think is unfair), I don't think these people understand the dynamics at play. It's not like I announce to everyone ""Hey guys, this is my girlfriend! We are dating!"" (although I really ought to, because she's a phenomenal woman). What generally happens is one of us will refer to other as ""babe"" during a game (e.g., ""nice pilot knockout, babe""), then someone asks if we're dating, and then all hell breaks loose.Also, every person who responded to this post with ""shut up bomber ♥♥♥♥♥"" just proved my point. I know you think you're hilarious but you're not gonna get a comedy special for your scathing wit.",neg
"Honestly, this is one of the best f2p game that exist bar none. The grinds are not bad and the rewards are decent. The best part about this game are the DEVELOPERS which I have said about no other game ever. They read the forums and will react to feedback sometimes responding to your post directly. I have literally only had 2 issues with the game and after submitting a ticket they were resolved in less than 24 hours. The gameplay is good but not overly complicated. The graphics are good but again strike a good balance for my machine aka I can run everything on high but not ultra. This game is a great fit for me because I do not have a bunch of free time and just want to unwind for a couple of hours and get in a few co-op matches and snatch a few drop pods. So if you are a casual gamer who doesn't have a ton of free time I highly recommend you give it a spin. It is easy to learn but not so easy to master so there is depth.  The maps look good, the ships look good the ai is decent. If you are more competitive it can accommodate that as well. The only thing holding this title back is it needs more players so install it and give it a try. If you like space combat/sci-fi then it will not disappoint.",pos

"Early Access ReviewAfter a few hours playing and reaching level 10 (i know it's not a lot of time but i had to decide, refund or waste money)Also this game has been released in other regions and has failed there miserably. ~60mil went into making it, and it feels like they are trying to get some money back for the investors.The game feels and looks 'old' and unfinished, it's from 2012 and it shows.The UI is dreadfull, open something and the game 'hangs', some things don't even work (market).Combat feels lacking, yes it's better then it was before but having no 'normal' attack feels weird. Also not being able to dodge and the 'lag attacks' makes it annoying.The stuff in the cash shop is just crap.Also when your party is at a dungeon 'teleporting/summoning' there will costs real life money.And then the market is already ruined, due to a dupe bug which was in all previous versions... the economy = ruined.Early access means nothing in this case, it's from 2012... if they didn't fix the issues in the last 6 years... they won't.",neg
"Dota 2 is the most popular Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game in the world.If you ever heard League of Legends or Heroes or Newerth,they are the copies of the original Dota 1,which was a mod for Warcraft III game.Dota 2 is amazingly improved compared to Dota 1 in the matter of design and mechanism.In case you have no idea what is a MOBA game : Each game consists of 2 teams, The Radiant and The Dire.Each team has their main building called The Ancient,3 melee barracks,3 ranged barracks,11 towers,and some small buildings that has no use.The main goal is to destroy the enemy's ancient.Each player are given control of 1 of your chosen 'hero',which has their own roles and skills.The map is divided into 3 lanes which are seperated by jungles filled with neutral monsters that you can kill for gold.You need to level up your hero along the game and buy him/her items from the shop.You need gold to buy the items that will upgrade your hero's damage/movement speed/HP regen/etc.You'll get the gold from killing non-controllable AIs called 'creeps' that will spawn on every lane,neutral creeps,destroying enemy structures,or killing enemy heroes.Pros :+ Amazing graphics and animations for a MOBA game+ Requires a long time to learn this game+ Non Pay-to-Win,all items are cosmetics only+ Requires full teamwork and communication+ Extremely challenging gameplay+ Hard-to-master heroes+ Millions of players online everyday+ Bots available for private practice match.Do this before going into real PvP to avoid being bullied.Cons :- Too many serious players,since the prize of the tournaments are really big- Mini update almost everyday.This is a problem for people with slow internet connection- No more free cosmetic items from games unless you pay for tickets to predict who will win the game- Tons of rude,non-communicative,non-english speaker players.Especially Filipinos.I'm sorry,I'm not racist.It's a fact that from my 350+ hours of gameplay,about 95% of filipinos I met are extremely childish and have no manners.Please,pinoys,don't think I don't know what does ""tangina bobo pota"" means.(Southeast Asia region community)- Tons of people with slow internet connection still persist to play the game,which will ruin the whole team with their lag.If you don't have decent stable internet connection,DO NOT play Dota.- Tons of people with insufficient PC spec but still persist to play Dota,which will cancel a lot of match because of their endless-loading-time or destroys the whole team with their fps lag.PLEASE read the minimum spec requirements- Very expensive cosmeticsOverall,Dota 2 is a game that's used for professional gaming (e-sports) and most of them never see Dota 2 as a game.They see it as a goldmine to make a living.Do not be surprised with the amount of serious players you'll meet.The gameplay is quite challenging and difficult to learn.Like CS:GO,this game is not made for casual fun.But it's free.There's nothing wrong to download and try this game if you have stable internet connection and acceptable PC spec.",pos
"I wish i could recommend. I wish i could like this game. I racked up over 24 hours of play time in 4 days of trying the game.This game is hand's down the most frustrating and tear provoking game that invokes levels of nerd rage i did not know possible. Why is that?I'm glad you asked.This game has the depth, and pontential to be great. However as it stands the mechanics are god awfully skewed in a way i did not forsee. ESL has less RNG spam as Hearthstone, which should make it a better game right? Wrong. The impact RNG has on this game in a single play can decide an entire match based off 1 lucky RNG roll.The RNG mechanics of this game impact very high value moves. The rune system means if you get all 5 of your runes poped and no prophecy, and your opponet pops 2 of his, and both are prophecies you are done. You will likely not over come 2 free (often powerful) card plays. In the most critical of needs RNG will fail you. Absolutely, and unapologetically. Leaving you to go 10-15 game losing streaks. Intellect, stragey, tactics, and brillant deck building means nothing. In the end all that matters is luck. The only silver lining is that the P2Win fest that is Hearthstone is less applicable as even a dekc of 30 legendaries can, and will still get screwed by bad RNG rolls. ** One pro was the story mode, it was fun, and interesting. However over all this game falls flat on it's competitive play being decided for you. You don't decide anything, the draw decides everything. *** I once went 8 games in a row where i would get stuck with a 9 cost legendary in my first draw or intial hand in some way. I had 70 cards in that deck, and yet 1 out of 70 chances out of 8 games i got stuck with a useless card that caused me to lose vs opponents who always have the right cost cards for opening play. There is nothing more infuriating then knowing you are losing to people not because of skill, or tactics - simply because the game decided it didn't want you to win. That is not a fun game.",neg

"My ""Review"" of Heroes & Generals. AKA: Things I like and things I don't like...Let's start positive. Things I Like:- It's a free online WW2 shooter- It has character customization that isn't too unrealistic (except for some weapon skins)- It has everything you'd expect: Different weapons, vehicles, 3 factions and different classes, progression. - They give out the odd free item. - Shooting is enjoyable (I only tried 2 weapons though)- There are weapon and character upgrades. Things I don't like:- It's a free online WW2 shooter...so expect bad team players, connection/server issues, premium currencies and premium status that grants a bonus to xp (basically making you unlock better weapons quicker. Quite unfair)- Your starting gear as the US: An M1 Garand...that's it. You have to level up to unlock a knife, pistol, grenades (you know, things every soldier had that aren't really as handy as a rifle). Ultimately, this makes matches so god damn dull. I never once thought I'd begin to get bored of the M1 Garand sounds but when all you hear is *puff puff ping puff puff puff ping ping* for an hour straight, it will drive you mad. - Battles are really empty. So much so it seems too quiet to be a battlefield. Again, dull. - Wow, I can change the colour of my helmet and the colour of my uniform. But wait, I'll only ever see it in the menu, what's the point? Hell, when changing helmets, the display doesn't even update. - I have great internet connection. Played a lot of multiplayer matches in other games. Not one issue. This game? Rubberbanding every 15 ♥♥♥♥in' seconds. I played almost 2 hours and it was infuriating. Literally no other game I own has that issue. - Saving up for that one class you want isn't going to make the game any better. I had just about had enough of the connection issues and decided to play until I could afford to play as a Paratrooper (Band of Brothers style). Did not help. Very disappointing animations for the character and the plane, not to mention you can get shot out of the sky by anyone with a gun who looks up. And, saving up for that character ended up giving me LESS options to customise. - Stamina system. For a soldier, you really can't ♥♥♥♥ing run far. The Generals part? You have to put a lot more hours in than I did. I love strategy games and I've played thousands of hours of them on here and I'm 100% sure I would have been disappointed with that mode too. - Most things in the trailer/screenshots barely happen and obviously been set up. Except for that stupid♥♥♥♥♥cycle. Every time I see a German Tony Hawk, I focus fire on his silly♥♥♥♥♥as he struggles to turn the damn thing. Driving reminds me of Garry's Mod addons. I really wanted this game to be at least decent and satisfying. And although I won almost every match I played I was still disappointed. Would not recommend. I'd prefer to buy my friends any Brothers in Arms game instead of wasting their time with this cheap trash.",neg

"Team Fortress 2 has been regularly updated since its inception in 2007, after over nine years in development. Due to all these updates, the game has actually taken on several incarnations. In other words, I will be individually reviewing the following three separate games:Team Fortress 2 (2007-2010)Hat Fortress 2 (2010-2012)Dressup Fortress 2 (2012-present)But first,General:-You can regularly defy the laws of physics in too many ways to be listed.-Scouts can fly by flapping their legs.-A can of soda turns you into the Super-Matrix; you can make bullets dodge you.-Some pistols can make you jump higher or fully absorb the impact of falling at any velocity.-Coating someone in milk and then beating them up will cure your cancer.-Steel-toed boots make shooting rockets at your feet less unhealthy.-Whipping people makes them run faster.-A big Russian guy can survive as many direct hits from an anti-tank missile as a Russian T-72 tank can.-Blowing into a seashell can patch the gunshot wounds of everyone around you.-Flamethrowers can also shoot a powerful blast of air that can send people flying or rockets back to their maker.-You can beat people to death with a bottle of whiskey.-You can decapitate people with a golf club.-Harmless explosives.-Eating a sandvich will cure AIDS, mend katana wounds, and treat your erectile dysfunction.-Hitting a machine with a wrench will fix it, upgrade it, and resupply it.-Dispensers generate ammo for your weapon and pills for your back pain.-A remote control with one big red button can be used to destroy one of any four buildings of your choosing.-You can shoot up morphine with a crossbow.-You can use a beam of light to turn someone’s exterior skin and clothing into pure titanium armor.-Pretending to play the violin with a bonesaw used for amputation will cure the common cold.-Urine is more effective than a fire extinguisher.-Frenchmen with ski masks are incapable of stabbing their victims in the neck. When they encounter Australians with shields on their backs, they’ll stab the shield first… Making the shield disintegrate.-A pocket watch can partially absorb the damage caused by a rocket, create a deceased doppelganger of you, all while you become invisible and walk away.-If you backstab someone with an icicle, they’ll instantly transform into a highly-durable ice sculpture. Team Fortress 2 (2007-2010)This was a team-based first person shooter involving two identical teams, differing only in color and artistic design, vying for control of various strategic locales around the world. You could play as one of nine cripplingly overspecialized classes. The various classes would have to pool their strengths together and cooperate in order to prevail over the opposing team. However, this was easier said than done as communication and teamwork were (and still are) generally foreign concepts. Teams would have to beat each other up and steal their briefcases, beat each other up and steal their stage lighting platforms, and beat each other up to push a high explosive bomb cart into a pit. Hats were just a cool side thing. Many people would stand around and do nothing on dedicated idle servers so that they could amass the metal necessary to craft themselves a new hat. Overall, Team Fortress 2 was a fun and highly addictive game whether or not there was a team or no team involved.Over 9 out of 9, worth the weight.Hat Fortress 2 (2010-2012)The Mann-Conomy Update, released on September 30, 2010, marked the end of Team Fortress 2 and the birth of Hat Fortress 2. Players no longer needed to idle to get hats. They could also buy them, trade for them, and even sell them for other hats. In addition, keys were also introduced, giving players the ability to throw away their parent’s or their own hard-earned money on opening virtual crates in the hopes of getting virtual hats. More often than not, they ended up getting worthless virtual guns. The Mann-Conomy fever quickly swept over Team Fortress 2, reducing it to a side game. Hat Fortress 2 was about accumulating as many hats as possible by any means necessary and then using the Team Fortress 2 mini-game to show them off to others. The free-to-play update in 2011 further enlarged the player base, increasing the popularity of Hat Fortress 2, its modes, and related fun mini-games. As Hat Fortress 2 was further refined and developed, new elements were added, including unusuals and non-hat cosmetic items. Eventually, so many new cosmetics came in that Hat Fortress 2 gradually evolved into another game.11 hats out of 10.Dressup Fortress 2 (2012-Present)This is the current and ultimate form of Team Fortress 2. The game is centered on assembling a complete outfit for each of the classes that you play. You can acquire the components for your dream outfit by unboxing crates of all shapes and sizes and/or by implementing any one of the many trading strategies out there. You can show off your outfits, topped off with exorbitant unusual hats, in a multitude of ways. You can do the conga, hi-five other folks adorned with fancy and quirky outfits, play intense games of rock, paper, scissors, or play Jack Black’s guitar. You can also play whatever vestiges remain of the old Team Fortress 2. You could also play Mann vs. Machine and acquire stock weapons with robotic skulls hanging from them or perhaps even become The Man with the Golden Gun. If neither of those are satisfactory, there are a wide range of other mini-games to play, some of which have been around since the days of old Team Fortress 2. They include, but are not limited to: Versus Saxton Hale, Freak Fortress 2, Jailbreak, Balloon Race, TF2 Kart, magic spells in Halloween event maps, Slender Fortress, Surf maps, Jump maps, and TF2Ware. In conclusion, Dressup Fortress 2 does provide something for everyone, so I guess it’s alright.11/10 iterations of Gaben. And my favorite class is the Spy. Thanks, and have fun!",pos
"New review, they removed 3/4 of all end game dungeon, class balance is still a myth, even more p2w than ever, still a lot of bug unfixed since mod 6 is out and they're not going to be fixed anytime soon. They going to release stronghold soon, wich is a 4th domination match map. PvP is only domination. Only good point of this game, gameplay.Ain't worth it anymore. They don't fix bug there's only 6 dungeon in end game. Only 3 pvp map atm 4 with stronghold. Bug abuser, gold farmer/spammer in the chat. Gear based game(I wouldn't mind it if it was less pay to win). And perfect world is the worst company when it come to managing a mmo. Just go on the star trek online store page or APB reloaded one they are all manage by this company and they are all heavily pay to win.",neg

"TL:DR: The best, most fair and truely real free to play-model out there. New League will start in december - be part of it!There is no xp-booster, better weapons or all this ""hidden"" pay2win-items in the store. Just skins off all sorts and diffrent kind of bank-slots (you will be fine without those). Now you might think: well if this is so great free to play it must be a trash game because other companys tell us again and again, that they need the pay2win-shops to be able to sustain a good game. It's the opposite:Path of Exile is a fantastic game. Extremly difficult and challenging. And it get's more love from it's developer than most other games do. The updates and ""Expansion"" (they are called Leagues and are free) are extremly frequent and well polished. Every 3 monthes a new League get's published.The developers are heavy connected with the fans and completly open about everything. There are news, roadmaps and much more on a daily base.Since it's free: why don't u simply try it yourself? Keep in mind though: this is not some dumbed down easy walk in the park thing - it IS extremly difficult. The passive skilltree will blow your mind. You will enjoy your start into the game the best by following a well writen build-guide from the official forum. Pick a build that sounds fun and follow the level guide. It won't spoil the game for you! Because you will keep replaying the story and all.",pos
"Early Access ReviewI'ts good. Considering its still in Beta. update:  i'd like to point out a few things:AQ3D isn't for everyone, its mostly for those who are young, just want to play casual, or wants to spend TONS of money (i'd give a negative review but ill be sticking to positive). The Game is still in ""OPEN BETA"" so yes, not much content in it YET, future updates and changes will come along be it sooner or later. I can still remember how AQ, MQ, DF, and AQW started out at 1st. and its no different from AQ3D starting out too. The Devs are working hard so that no major problem comes in the game like crashing, not loading maps, missing items etc. (only major problem in the game is that some good items, seasonal items that are only for cosmetics are costly, BUT YOU ARE NOT OBLIGED OR REQUIRED TO PAY or BUY... OK?! I mean, the game will still grow, you can get future content when you can afford to buy expensive stuff.....)The grind to craft is tedious. but isnt it just similar to AQW? to grind for reputation to get the cool items, to grind items to get those nulgath items?At the end of the day, its only a game.",pos
"It's an interesting game and it can teach you a lot about the architexture of guns, but for those who are interested in it more for being a 3D Dictionary of Guns and Gun parts, this is a Moneygrab and too big a time-waster. Pros: Unlockable, very detailed assortment of Guns for your viewing pleasure and curiousity, has features of a game.Cons: The list of guns isn't all that big.It takes too much time to unlock all guns/models if you just want to look at a specific gun.Game offers expensive moneygrab DLC, which doesn't unlock certain features/models.Game doesn't let you play offline.Conclusion: Too cumbersome to be of immediate use for the itch of Gun curiousity.It's more for mobile twits despite being on the PC platform.",neg
"Some facts first:I am playing TheHunter for almost 5 years now.Spent about 150 EUR.Still enjoying the game because of the updates and good cooperation of devs and community.Yes - I recommend this game.It is a special genre for patient players.For beginners it´s recommended to read the Wiki/forums first and play some tutorials perhaps.I really like the atmosphere in the reserves - there are a lot in the meantime.From spring to winter - from rabbits to bisons...you can play through a lot of different missions which gives you ""Gamedollars"" as reward to buy consumableswhich are pretty helpful in the game.The recent update (Jan 27th 2016) allows guests (F2P) to hunt more than one species nowand hunt them in different reserves.

"Planetside 2 is, and with no doubt, THE FPS/MMO out there, the game is simply massive. The game is free but if you want to buy stuff like camo, guns and stuff, you have to get Station Cash, which is the in-game money. In my case I never bought anything with station cash, just a 2 bucks small pack off Steam. The other way you can get upgrades and weapons is by getting certs, which you gain by killing enemy players, repairing vehicles and units, though, many of these weapons are kind of expensive in terms of certs and it takes a while to get some of them, but in time you start getting certs and using them to upgrade your vehicles and your character's shields and/or qualities. If you are new to FPS's the gameplay could be a little bit confusing and hard to understand, but once you get the idea and the whole concept you enter into a new level of battle, forget about Call of Duty or Battlefield, those games look tiny and insignificant next to the massive idea behind PS2, TOTAL WAR is unleashed every day between the 3 factions introduced in the game (GO NC, GO!). It is not necessary to buy weapons in my honest opinion, but the base weapons you start with (especially for the NC) are wild and sometimes hard to manage due to the recoil, but in time you get used to it. Battles develop in a massive scale, you get to see dozens of tanks battling each other, aircrafts dogfighting in the limitless sky, hundreds of soldiers shooting and firing everywhere, total chaos that is rewarded with a fun time, even more if you are part of an outfit, which makes things much more fun and interesting. Once you get to understand the game, you feel the need to keep on playing, even to the extent that you forget about your whole library and can't quit the excellent approach of this game, if you are looking for a whole new experience in multiplayer gaming, Planetside 2 is for you. I totally recommend this game for all gamers, plus it is totally free!",pos
"Early Access ReviewWhat can i say about this? If you're a Magic the gathering fan it's pretty decent and the only real thing that i has in common with Hearthstone is the style.as with all card games Luck can and will skrew you over as well as bless you and make you feel epic. to complain about RNG in a card game is just silly. I have not had much troubel at all with making decent decks on this game with  gauntlet mode and forge making it easy to get a decent collection as well as  the ability to frag all the extras and create what you want. Granted some cards are way over priced but think of it this way, some people payed £100+ for a zapdos or £1000+ for a black lotus in magic terms. All in All decent card game with a  mana system similar to magic, but slower paced than Hearthstone.And it's free to play so you can get a feel for the game before you decide to commit so give it a try!",pos
"Pros :Great art styleGreat gameplayVery simple to learn : the more you play, the better you getWeapons and legends somewhat well balanced (it was for a long time, at the time of this review some patches just changed the meta but I'm sure it'll be fine)Great economic system : entierly free to play, the game relies on people buying skins (same as League of Legends)Cons :Matchmaking needs to be re-workedIf you have low internet speed, you can't play competitivelyEnd-of-game chat is a jokeOverall, the game is awesome, but the multiplayer system around it needs some work.",pos
"Early Access ReviewFor a gamer that doesn't play any type of fps, this is a fun one.  My only problem is that I am a noob at these types of royale games and I got 3 eliminations in 10 matches before logging off like I do to all the other games like this. All of the pros and all of the noobs in the same match makes it hard and frusturating to play.  I know this can be solved by dedicating hours and hours of gameplay into this but that doesn't interest me.  So I will probably not play much of this game but it was well put together.",pos

"For New PlayersYu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links is a free-to-play, digital collectible card game developed by Konami for iOS, Android, and now PC. Saves/Profiles transfer across all platforms.The game was first released in Japan in November of 2016 and worldwide on January of 2017.Duel Links features characters from the Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters anime. Seto Kaiba has created a virtual reality ""Duel World"" in order to gather the best duelists so they can compete. Players first have the option to play as either Yami Yugi or Seto Kaiba. As they continue to win duels, other characters become unlocked. Duel World is the hub area where a character can be selected and challenge either a Standard Duelist or Legendary Duelist to obtain cards and increase the character's Level. It is possible to increase the stage level by doing missions, and by doing so, a new Legendary Duelist or new features will appear.The game features cards and characters from mostly the 1st-3rd seasons of the anime, with GX being the most recent. Pendulm and Synchro have not yet been implemented, but have been datamined.In Online Versus mode, it allows real time duels with other Duelists or friends around the world. Furthermore, there are practice plays, Decks from Duelists played against, and replays from other Duelists can be watched.The game does not follow the same rules as the TCG, but instead, more of a speed format. It was designed for mobile and meant to be quick ~5 minute matches. The changes are as follows:Each player only has three Monster Zones and three Spell & Trap Zones, rather than five of each.Each player must have 20-30 cards in their Main Deck (instead of 40-60) and 0-5 cards in the Extra Deck (instead of 0-15).Each player starts with 4000 LP, rather than 8000 LP.Each player starts with four cards in their hand, rather than five.There is no Main Phase 2. The End Phase takes place right after the Battle Phase.Each player can have one Skill. The available Skills vary between characters. Depending on the Skill, it may be always activated at the start of the Duel (e.g. starting with ""Yami"" on the field), optionally activated when a player meets certain conditions (e.g. ensuring the next drawn card is a Spell or Trap Card after the player's Life Points have dropped by 1800), or always activated when a condition is met (e.g. inflicting damage when the player activates a Trap Card).Extra Monster Zones are not used, with Extra Deck monsters functioning as they did before the introduction of the Extra Monster Zone.My ConsensusI've been playing since the official US release. With any mobile free-to-play game, there are microtransactions. Each month, they release card boxes that can be bought using Gems, the in-game currency. Gems are earned by simply playing the game and completing challenges. They're also given away like candy at times by Konami. Packs can also be outright bought with actual money. Card boxes usually contain 200 or 80 packs, depending if they're a full or mini box. Each pack you purchase contains 3 cards, so you'll likely be grinding for that certain card for quite awhile. Legendary duelists also have certain card drops that you'll be grinding for as well. The game itself is honestly a giant time sink and very P2W, but the current meta deck, Cyber Angels, is completely F2P. All-in-all, it's a fun, but sometimes frustrating game. PVP can be cancerous at times, depending on the meta, but it's the best Yu-Gi-Oh game at the moment, in my opinion. If you're a fan of card games and Yu-Gi-Oh, I recommend giving it a try.To Returning Duel Links PlayersOverall, the port seems pretty good.Auto Duel is extremely fast. I have yet to run into any bugs. I'll update if I do. You also receive an alt-art BEWD upon logging in.If you'd like to run the game at fullscreen, follow these instructions:Go to your Steam install folder.Open steamapps/commonFind the folder ""Yugioh Duel Links""Open the folder and run ""DuelLinksConfiguration.exe""From there, you can change the resolution and enable/disable fullscreen mode.

"I'm not an expert on this type of game, but can say that Tiny Tower (Nimblebit) circa 2014 was way less infuriating and way more engaging.I've played both on mobile and on PC. The game is much more suited for mobile, but it was too difficult on a small screen. Attackers at the door, then a stray touch (easy to do on ""bezel-less"" and curved screen phones) would zoom way in on a random spot on the screen...zoom back out, try to grab a 3mm tall guy on the screen, but can't do that until the resources are collected...collect the resources, misclick trying to tap-hold the guy 3 more times, zoom back in, grab him, slowly drag him to the vault door at max zoom, have the screen not register your finger for a moment while dragging him, scroll back down to that room, grab him again, and finally.........stick him in the front room. Now check his weapon, try sorting the weapon list, but still have to go through a list of 15 weak weapons to find your one rare/legendary that you stuck on someone after a failed rush.......now you have 1 defender! Of course, the fight's halfway over now, people are dead.Now, watch slow, mostly passive combat with quirky, seemingly redundant controls. Are we having fun yet? TERRIBLE experience, boring as hell. And now you've wasted 8 hours of travel time because you wanted to save a few medpacks for incident emergencies.Later, once you finally get a little resource security and medpack capacity, even if you don't have a radio station, watch deathclaws rip through your entire vault while you try to stop them with hunting rifle equivalents. Rage quit. Come back a bit later, get hit with deathclaws again before you've even been able to heal up from the first attack. Live in constant fear of the next deathclaw attack--or even the next scorpion attack, now that you're out of medpacks and rushing them is too risky--the next attack could wipe out your entire vault. Extremely mismatched risk for a game that's mostly planning and hands-off waiting. The best way to avoid losing your vault is to keep the game closed as much as possible. Lol?Next day, your phone screen turns on once in the middle of the night...wake up to a pile of bodies and no way to roll back to the last save. Give up on that vault. There's so much waiting that you'll probably have the same result after falling asleep during all the excitement.Tried switching to PC to deal with pain of moving defenders around to incidents, but it was almost as much a PITA as on Android. Also, the tap zooming is ridiculous. I just want to turn it off completely and only have it respond to mousewheel zoom. --Positives: - Appropriately priced base game.- The humor is legitimately great, especially for Fallout fans.- Cloud save doesn't work between Steam and Android, but you can manually transfer unaltered savefiles between the two platforms. - You can also back up these files, but it's kind of a pain.- Possible to edit your saves if you can resist doing things that will ruin progression.- Critical hit meter is cool.- Epically soporific excitement. Waiting 7 minutes for your medpacks to finish, 3 hours for your baby dweller, 3 more for them to grow up, 7 hours for your special point training, 6 hours for your team to get to a diner to fight a radroach, 8 hours for your scavenger to return, and 4 days for your weapon, all intermixed with deathclaw panic.--Negatives:Freemium or not, I expect a LOT more from a major studio in terms of design. The basic interface interactions have NONE of the refinement/friendliness of your average knock-off clash game, and there's a lot to be desired in terms of quality of life. Also, deathclaws are ridiculously unbalanced at early levels.Started on Android, but loads of problems. CONSTANT CRASHING. Had to reload game twice each time after it had been fully shut down. Quests would take like 10+ seconds of loading screen, usually followed by a crash. This is on probably the most popular flagship phone running Oreo. (Coudn't get it past the savefile screen on MEmu either.)  Hey Bethesda, maybe hire some mobile devs...on day 1, my phone actually warned me the app had crashed 10 times and that it was slowing down my phone. --If you could turn deathclaws off in normal mode OR if the controls didn't so often get in the way of reacting quickly (eg preset loadouts, or pausing game while using equipment/garrison interfaces) I'd be way more excited about this game. -- Edit: Oh yeah, and the rush %sages are absolute garbage.  40%=90%. This mechanic isn't clever or challenging, it's just dumb. Given their obnoxious interface, the number should 1. accurately reflect the base rate, obviously, AND 2. visibly change based on the luck modifiers present so you don't have to tediously check every dweller's setup.Whoever designed this mechanic should see if McD's is hiring.",neg
"I find most of the negative reviews for this game to be unspecific and mostly biased. Are Free Reign garbage devs/people? Yes. Is this game representative of that? No. I have found this game to be casual and easy, but fun. the community complaints are true, but I've managed to find coop opportunities with players in the field, and have had some good moments. Loot is easy to get, which puts all players on an even playing field, and not hard to keep. If you simply exit the world and go to your character inventory on the main menu, you can stow your loot without risk. The game runs fine on my low end PC on max graphical settings, and the game is in no way Pay 2 Win. Overall, if you want a casual time-waster and don't want to spend hours grinding for an empty dun (like in Dayz) then download. The game even has a decent battle royale game mode.",pos
"I really hope the game developers read this review....The GAME NEEEDS CHECKPOINTS!!!For a simulator that is focused on ultra realism there are some things missing for sure. The game is really fun don't get me wrong, I love how the game really focuses on the mechanics of flight and how important the physics play into flying. This review is all centered around the Huey Mod as this was the one I'm really trying to master. 1) The training/tutorial sucks. I know this a beta but for someone who never played a serious helicopter sim in his life this definetly took some time getting used to. The training only had a few videos and then it plops you in and its almost like ""ok you got that quick vid, you got it!"" no,,,,no I didn't...Thankfully there were some awesome Youtube vids that I was able to turn to to explain the finer points. Theres no training on how to land effectivly, no training on how to land or fly in exceptionally windy conditions, No kind of video or training explaining what things will trigger or cause failure...just boom! oh great...my engine is on fire...no idea why...Theres no training on how to work the complex radio system, in the campaing its just goes ""ok set the ADF to this..."" Had no idea until I had to check Youtube (a godsend) The game is fun no lie, the ultra realism is very apealing to someone who's always dreamed of flying a helicopter (Huey mod) but the game (in the campaign especially) would be alot more fun if there were checkpoints along the way that you could respawn at if you died. I get that mistakes are going to be made, but I've been stuck on one particular mission for a very long time as the mission has you trecking a very sizable distance and along the way you can make a mistake and boom dead...no chance to repeat or replay from a landing point. Frustrating to say the least!In the end, would I recommend it? Yes, for those who want a ultra realistic game that literally feels like you're flying a huey...but be prepared for a spotty training videos that leave alot to be desired and know that the ultra realism means that if you die....have to start allllll over.",pos

How they work, how to disassemble/reassemble them, and all the names of the individual parts.There's even two little other things for animal skeletons, motorcycles, and cars.

Since I don't believe anything should be free and we enjoy playing this so much, I have happily spent my hard earned cash in the game which enables you to enjoy more tanks and faster experience.I'm sure many die-hard WOT fans will consider this trivial in comparison to the full game but for those of us who like to pop-in and out for a quick distration now and then it's a perfect format.We enjoy playing this game so much we started our own Clan MAYHM; look us up when your in the game and feel free to appy for membership, we will be dissmissing many members with preference towards players from STEAM.Look me up - MetalMayhemMasterHappy hunting!!!",pos
"This game is complete and utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ I wanted to give it a chance, but of course the first day they were having ""server issues"", so i decided to wait it out. played for a little bit but still was not impressed. graphics are horrible, you're lucky to be alive after 10 seconds after spawn since peple just seem to sit there and kill you for no damn reason. (this being mentioned there is no PvE servers at all!) the battle ground spawn is literally the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing i've ever seen in a video game, it spawns you inside of like 5 other players and  everyone just waits right there at the spawn to get kills. there is literally no point in even putting their half-minded thought into creating a map, you'd be better off making it a 10 foot square room and saying here you go guys. you have to try and join a server like 5 times before the game either doesn't crash or make you sit through the long♥♥♥♥♥loading screen just until finish and it notifies you that you have been disconnected from the server. the only positive thing i could say about this game is that it's free, not that anyone would pay money for this peice of♥♥♥♥♥♥game created by people with the brains the size of hampsters. I've literally became so mad with this game I dont even care how bad my grammar is in this review, if anything they will understand most of it fully. DO NOT EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS GAME!! they will probably delete this comment or ban me but i dont really care. you have been warned.",neg
"Early Access ReviewFractured Space is exaclty what it says in its description. You are in charge of a large spaceship where you have to decide where to postition yourself and when you fire to get the most out of your weapons/abilities. Inevitably this is going to be compared to star trek, battlestar galactica, dreadnought, star conflict but i believe that this game can take elements from these games/shows to make a unique game with a solid free to play system.Still in early access so keep in mind some things may change.Their are a total of 12 ships which have varying unique properties. Graphics, effects and models are fantastic with improvements to quality and performance every major update. Having more local servers would be nice (to reduce ping) but its quite easy to find a game. With each update the game gets better and better.Overall a great game, essentialy a moba in space with large spaceships with flashy battles. Love to see how this develops. The price for the forerunner and harbinger are woth playing the game but keep in mind that this is going to be free to play in the future.EDIT: updated with more current info",pos
"Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion is a Free Retro maze game with jump scares and death.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  I took a wrong turn somehow and keep getting killed by a ghostly creature around room 61, i guess i need to restart and take a different route.  Has a retro look, sort of like Castle Wolfenstein or Doom.   Has creepy music and sounds.  It has 1,000 rooms to go through.

"I really love these types of games. I've played a lot and I feel I could easily sink a few hundred hours into this title. Pros: Great Classes, Cool graphics, easy to get into but with layers of complexity built in with formation strategies and placing toons in just the right spots, and it's great that it plays even if you log off, so you're always making progress...Cons: Very, Very addictive!!!I'm really glad they added the game to Steam, because I think it's great!",pos
"Early Access ReviewFor the 6 hours I played, non-stop mind you, I have to give this game a lot of credit. A friend bought this for me after telling me about it and I was a bit iffy on the idea of another sandbox game similar to Minecraft. But, there is a lot of differnces between the two games.The structure of the game itself gives a whole new feel if you are use to playing Minecraft. It's not as easy as chop some wood, mine some stone, then you're good to go. There is a lot of depth to just the crafting alone. While it is still fairly easy to find all the resources you need, you need a lot of them. Even after you collect them, you might need to use some tools to break it down into a different matterial. (For example, breaking vines down into twine.) Yes, you have wait times on crafting stuff. While it isn't too terribly bad, the times do get a bit longer as you start using more advanced materials such as Obsidian, Iron, and Diamonds. But in my opinion, it adds more to the game because now you have to wait 5 minutes to advance and in that time, you could go out and collect more resources or even go spelunking.The creatures in the game is definitely unique. While some do remind me of creatures from Jak and Daxter (the night Pigsy's and night Leafi's), they still have a unique vibe to them. And they of course vary in difficulty. While a few of them have unique skills such as blinding you for a short time or spinning to do a lot of damage, there isn't a lot to worry about as long as you keep some distance.Also, there is furniture. And to be honest, it actually looks pretty nice. There is also a lot of ways to customize and build your own house and make it stand out from your friends. You have different types of carpet, walls, and even slanted roof planks you can craft. You even have different colored lamps. You could use them like my friend does and make each room different colors. Though the blue sometimes confuses me because I never know if it is dark out or not. But it still looks really nice. Much like a room with a bunch of black lights.To add on to the crafting idea to the game, you do not start off with being able to craft everything in the game. You have to work your way up and find the recipes. While some of them are scattered in chests around the world, you usually unlock new ones after you craft something else. Like weapons for instance. After you craft a wood sword, you unlock the crafting recipe for a stone sword. Which means you have to work to find better things, meaning you actually have a goal to work towards.While there is still some bugs in the game with it being early access, it still runs fairly smooth and it's easy to play with friends. No port forwarding or setting up custom servers. Simply create a world and set a password so your friends can join up. Even when you are offline, they can still join the world and continue which to me, is pretty awesome. I would gladly recommend this game to anyone who likes Minecraft or sandbox games in general. And I think if you actually take some time with this game, you'll find there is a lot of possibilites with it.",pos
"This review is of course for the PC version of Bethesda's & Behaviour Interactive's Fallout Shelter. It originated as a mobile app which from its initial launch in June 2015 I enjoyed on my phone very much, up to a point. I remember being so excited to hear this announced at E3! The PC version works identically, which means some pros and cons in the transition from mobile to PC.The way games are designed on one platform or another can reflect the nature of the platform and intended use of or vision for said games. Fallout Shelter is one of those that just works better as a mobile app.Ultimately it comes down to time gated activities and rewards. It's tough to sit down and play this for prolonged periods of time as a dedicated PC game. On my phone, it feels totally natural to fire it up, hit all my resources, queue missions and all that then close the game to check it later.Now there's potential here for additions or improvements that bring the game more firmly into the PC space; I'm sure anyone who's tried it could brainstorm up a few ideas! My own run towards a more fleshed out questing system and deeper RPG elements. I'd also request a combat speed setting of some sort (on PC) so I don't have to sit through the plodding, drawn out fights during a mission. A little too slow as is.I don't enjoy how certain events seem to be scripted. The specific example in mind is that some type of incident triggers shortly after game startup each new day (in game or real time, not sure). Early on these crises are simple, manageable. But they increase in magnitude as your vault grows. Presumably a bigger vault has more personnel with better weaponry to repel invaders, put out fires, etcetera.At some point though, it's just a deathclaw raid each time! So tiresome since deathclaws take a little while to kill and really burn through stimpacks keeping vault dwellers standing. That lengthy, costly routine is the last thing I want to greet me every time I go to check on my vault. It quickly becomes off putting.It's gratifying to see ongoing support for the game, including balancing along with all new content, quests, items, etc. Bravo. They've also embraced the trend of seasonal events and mini-holidays, although that seems mostly relegated to cash shop discounts. The cash shop offers various perks and upgraded versions of regular things that can't be obtained otherwise.One noteworthy bug to warn you of: On rare occasion should the game crash, you may lose your save! Even if the files are still there. Regular manual backup of save files is the only sure way I've found to protect against this.I'm giving a positive review since this replicates the fun of the mobile version. Just bear in mind it can't necessarily be played for hours on end like a conventional videogame; that should be apparent from the outset.TIP: Frequently back up save files.TIP: The help section is useful in that it explains some mechanics & info you couldn't learn by any other means.",pos

"Early Access ReviewEternal is like Magic: The Gathering, but with a Dark Tower-esque theme. It's an incredibly rich and deep strategy card game that is extremely rewarding for a FTP title. It's got colorful and vibrant artwork and tables, intuitive UI and easy to understand mechanics. The only downside for new players at the moment is the mandatory tutorial missions at the beginning that drag for entirely too long. But if you can muscle through the beginner content, you'll find an amazingly rewarding digital card game like no other.",pos

"Early Access Reviewok, so the title doesn't make a lick of sense, not really, and it's basically a carbon copy of PUBG, but it's got snowboarding and nifty graphics that aren't TOO anime-ish. For what should be a generic cashgrab chinese battle royale clone, the weather and mobility twist makes it actually insanely fun. plus, rendering is fantastic - if you're good enough you can snipe someone clear across the map, with the right vantage point. The helicopter thing for four people is pretty pointless, because everyone just camps the helicopter and spams medpacks, so it's still basically last man standing. Other than that, this is a good PUBG knockoff, that i find myself playing more than PUBG itself. Here's to a good game before the inevitable pay to win cash shop that i just FEEL will eventually show up one day.",pos

trove is a great game and with the addition of craftable classes it means all classes are fairly easily obtained of course like most games these days trove has microtransactions which can be used to skip a lot of grinding.however there isnt really to much to do in the game and it becomes repetitive this means that it isnt to hard to learn the basics and if you ever need help you could always ask people in global or your club.,pos

"When I first played PS2, I did not care for the large open landscape and the lack of battle. Well, that was before I actually played enough to get into a fire fight. Picture this, you are out in an outpost. No enemy in the area,  just you and your pals hanging around and bored. You hear gunfire in the distance and think, okay just an enemy squad or a sniper. You'd be wrong when an entire platoon of infantry and tanks comes rolling down the road, opening fire on you and your friends as you scramble to get a turret or find cover from the tanks blasting at you. This game can go from ""meh"" to ""holy hell where is a medic!"" on the drop of a dime. The battles are intense, the class loadouts are fair and the maps are fu**ing huge! You do not want to be caught on foot while traversing the large landscape of this game. Of course the game allows in-game purchases with Daycash, but also allows you to purchase the same items with in-game currency as you level up. There are no weapons that can win the war, all of them balance eachother out. Vehicles are difficult to destroy, that is the only thing I see as a pain. But then again, it is a fu**ing tank! So grab some freinds, grab a vehicle and prepare for one hell of a fight. This game gets two thumbs up from me!",pos

"I always find it amusing when people give a thumbs down to a game they play every day and have hundreds and hundreds of hours invested in. Attack me for having an opinion if you want but if you are still actively playing a game and you have invested that much time, why would you give it a negative review? I mean, you seem to have gotten your money's worth out of it otherwise you wouldn't spend so much time playing the game. I understand the game has flaws. Heck, I have screamed about he slanted RNG and can't make it to legend in ranked to save my life. But haven't we all bought games for $50 - $60 and walked away with an opinion of ""meh.."", but that game wasn't worth writing a negative review. And the complaint that you get your butt kicked when you start playing and have to buy cards. Are you saying you didn't get your butt kicked in COD or PUBG when you first started? Come on now.....Yes, buying cards will help you along faster. But if you link your twitch account to drain drops when you aren't playing and hit the solo arena as often as possible, you will get cards, gold and soul gems very quickly. It is a fun card game. It is free. It is easy to get hundreds of hours invested and you can get where you want to be with some time and effort. Sure spending cash is a shortcut, but I have not seen many free games where that is not the case. But I also know people who have played this game as completely free, never invested a penny and still have formitable decks. You just have to be willing to grind a bit. If that isn't your thing, good luck finding a card game!",pos
"Having played for a few hours, I'm still not sure how I feel about this game. The greatest issue I am having with it is the loading times just to get in. Once the game was downloaded, it took over half an hour just to gain access, and then another half hour after logging in for the game to actually start. Once in the game, it was fairly straight forward for an MMO. To gain access to the extras, you need to subscribe and it constantly reminds you of this, but you're guided through the games and quests, which are fairly simple. For my kids, the wait times are insanely frustrating. Not too many kids are going to wait around for half an hour or more to play a game before finding something else to do. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is looking for something to do on the fly - chances are, you'll never get in during your free time. But it is entertaining once you actually gain access...",pos
"Fun game, has some good systems and makes you want to keep playing it, which is what you are after.  However you should be very careful when starting the game first time.  The game gives you an option to sign in with an account or click new.  If you click ""im new"" with the intention of logging into your account later (as in my case where i couldnt remember my password), you will be in a world of trouble.  It is almost impossible to get your account linked to your bethesda account later on.  For some incompetent reason, unlike every other site on the internet, they didnt put a sign in option next to register.  Some people say there is a sign out option in the settings, but it isnt there if you click ""im new"".  I have searched the internet for ways to fix it and all the solutions other people came up with didnt work.  They suggested to contact support, but all it had in customer support was some random generic problem and no option to type in a specific issue.

"Well, as a substitute to Monopoly, it's good, although it does have problems:a) When given the option to start a new table, I usually take it, as it's a good way for players to customise a game for their friends, but this usually ends in joining a full table anyway, making the option pointless. And when you join a full game, occasionally you aren't able to leave, practically forcing you to play a game you don't want to take part in.b) The game needs a chat function, emojis aren't enough, especially when a player is taking forever to rollc) The bots.

There's a few of those too.You will not get closer to flying these real aircraft from the comfort of your living room.Did I mention the F-18 Hornet is HERE?Did I mention that the Combined Arms DLC adds ground Armor operations?Please note - I will plug for buying direct from Eagle Dynamics instead of here on Steam, because here you won't get everything available (at least not in a timely manner).  That is all.",pos
"Early Access ReviewI much prefer this game to PUBG. I think PUBG has a bit of an identity issue and wants to be everything. This game balances it out quite nice and the 3 different forms of movement really add to the overall pacing of the game. My only issue with this game is the combat, the refresh rate, and the grappling movement option. Combat seems a bit stiff and favors camping. I know camping is inevitable, but maybe add a gas/molotov grenade to flush people out or something. Leaning should always be a key bind action if implemented. Refresh/tick rate of the game seems a bit off. On my screen I shot dead on, but died to a head shot a second later. It's always going to be an issue with battle royale games sure, but it's still a legitimate claim if they want to be competitive or have a public k/d win/loss statisitics. The Grappling movement option is severely limited to the predetermined routes on the map and the rock climbing is next to useless and extremely slow. A glider player could just get ahead of the grappling player and wait for them to show up to the next point and shoot them or the grappler could risk taking a fall and dying or attempt to go back up the rappeling line, which is extremely slow to turn around. They should greatly reduce fall damage for grapplers or add a parachute or increase the speed of the grappling movement and landing. Aslo, something can be said about the game ending heli, but I don't have a solution for that yet. Overall 7/10",pos
"Early Access ReviewIt's insane how good this game is, considering you can play it for free. Game is fun, good-looking and run smoothly - try it for yourself ;)At 2017-01-03 (written by complete newbie): Right off the bat you start within your own world with 40 inventory spaces and basic mining tool. LMB gather stuff, RMB place/use selected (item under highlighted 1-2-3... hotspot). Q to craft, E for inventory, TAB to quick swap weapon/mining. At night hostile mobs spawns at surface, underground you can find them all day. It's good to know that to gather some resources you have to place one-time-use items on them and wait. Placing torches reduces/prevents enemies from spawning. Crafting buildings and containers can be picked up and placed (if there are no items being stored/processed within them). Graphics are good. Jumping is kind of annoying but expected in this kind of game. There is insane amount of things you can craft and place ^_^",pos

Honestly as one of the best gamers in the world... I gotta admit you would hardly ever see me playing a game like this ever... truth..but once you check it out for yourself you'll see that all the bad reviews are nothing but trolls.. just today i spent 5 hours in there...  i was like holy♥♥♥♥♥♥.lol also the way you can build things are so much better then minecraft by a thousand... i take a step back an see what i created an say damn .... i made that.. an now i want people to come check it out... honestly its that fun... if you like to build things out of the blue an spend lots of hours having fun with your kids or friends this game will take you there... not only that all the animals look like they came from a bob marley festival ..lol seriously ... but that makes it even cooler.... i made my home on top of it all... i just started building on top of a tree an then three hours later i had a kingdom..lol but im still working on though ... so anyway i gave my two cents... download the game a see its the way mine craft should have been... seriously.. download give it a try an show you know how to create things out of thin air.... join us or forever no what its like.... lol truth,pos
"This is a great MMO to play for long and short periods of time. It can be either pay to win, and play to win so i think it's quite balanced in that era. I have seen alot of negative comments about how people have spent money on the game to buy equipment and then lost it due to deaths and are now complaining about it, perma-death is a large part of this game and when you pay to buy new stuff, you should think about how you could lose it before getting mad about it, Although I do understand the stress.All in all, the game is quite fun, is well updated and has a good amount of challenges and characters to keep the players happy.",pos

Growing up with MTG is likely the reason why I stick to this pile of inconsistencies and randomness while listening to podcasts. The amount of disconnects and ""weird"" hard to document occurences dampen the enjoyment a lot, but since I only spent 10 Euros on this, besides the easily 400 hours I could've used to learn Mandarin, I keep playing.

"Early Access ReviewI started off playing this on my mobile, then discovered it could be played on steam. Pros:It is free to play.You can switch between playing on PC and Mobile.The graphics are not bad.Nice simple UICharacters can be customised - although very basic customisationCons:Combat is very clunky.It is extremely repetitive. For example, I had to kill 5 of something, then 10 of the same thing, then 20 of the same thing, all for different quests.Levelling up is very slow.It is very easy to die, even when killing things a level lower than me.Some of the areas only seem available if you pay real money.There are no achievements.For me it has got quite boring, quite quickly simply because I have spent the last 45 minutes in the same area killing the same things over and over and over. As much as I am trying to like the game, I am not sure I can bring myself to go back in to it to kill yet more of the same. I know it is still in early access, and some of these things may improve with time, so I may come back to the game at some point to see if things have improved.",neg

"Early Access ReviewRobocraft used to be my favorite free game on Steam. Creative, fun gameplay. Now though, if you want to play Robocraft, you have to install a piece of third party software called ""EasyAntiCheat"" to play. As far as I can tell, EasyAntiCheat is a keylogger and a screencapper that periodically posts both screenshots and chat logs from the game, with an accompanying username, to a public database. EAC is flagged by most antivirus software, and for good reason - it is blatantly spyware that compromises users' privacy.I am deeply disappointed at the developers' decision to carelessly disregard their users' privacy, and will not play Robocraft or any other FreeJam game again until I am allowed to play without downloading intrusive third party software. Sadly, I cannot recommend this otherwise excellent game to anyone who cares about their privacy.",neg

You really have to know how to fly and navigate or this is not the Combat SIM for you. Others who compare this to ARMA3 or other arcade games need to get a life. This is a Combat Sim not a XboX Controller game. There is very steep learning curve and you really need to RTFM and do the Training missons to know how to use everything in the aircraft. I fly the A-10C, KA-50, and Huey alot. I do have many years of Flight Sim experience so flying them is no issue with me.

"Early Access ReviewGameplay is not fluid and feels choppy even after following reddit ini files tweak guide. Textures and models pop up on my screen every 10 feet, walking around feels very unnatural and weird. Kinda kills the immersion.Graphics are completely outdated, a lot of mobile games look better than Bless Online, and this is coming from someone who maxed all graphics settings. Shame, really.Servers are very unstable, Habbich went offline for a couple minutes without prior notice, it was very frustrating. Poor translation is still there, I was stuck on a quest for 15 minutes trying to figure out what it wanted me to do. The quest description didnt make any sense to begin with, it is like nobody proof read it before implementing.Considering this is a 7 year old game, I wasn't expecting an incomplete release full of bugs and optimization problems.

"I have played this game for around 5 years now, and I just wanted to write an honest review. I love this game, I always have. The idea of a MOBA in almost an FPS style is really cool, and almost seems more action orriented than other games like LOL or DOTA 2. Granted, it is harder if you can't aim or makes it EXTREMELY difficult if you are lagging, more so than other MOBAs. SMITE's god selection is really nice, with tons of creative design interpretations. However, being as they come out with new gods quicker than other games, sometimes the kits can become quite repetitive. Many gods don't have clear combos, while others do. Some I feel are just to ""get a god out"" type of thing, but this is not always the case. A lot of gods are very creative and their kits have a lot to do with the lore behind them, which is really nice to see that the developers care enough to research those things.Skins are always a money point in these free to play games, and it isn't much different in SMITE. The one thing I find about this game which is better than other MOBAs, is that they give daily log in rewards. If you log in every day, by the end of the week you will have been rewarded 50 gems. This is nice, because even if you don't have time to play a full game, you can hop on and get the reward before  going to school, work, etc. Most skins are 250 - 600 gems, so it may take a while to get a skin using only the free method, but it is worth it. SMITE is also always giving out free stuff, with quests, events, and more. Other companies don't allow you to get the paid currency with their rewards, and it's nice to see that change. Obviously Hi-Rez has to make money, but it almost seems that they care about their completely free players a little more than most companies.My favorite aspect (although quite simple) is the joust game mode. It allows me to play at least once per day, with a shorter average game than conquest. The games are usually around 20 minutes, and are just as much fun... as long as your team isn't being toxic like they can be in other MOBAs.Overall, I really enjoy this game, and highly recommend it to anyone looking for something new to try.",pos
"People complain that its ""pay to win"" cause you can buy ""better"" weapons. They are not better, they have diffrent situational advantages. And all of those weapons can be unlock through regular play. Also this is a skill based game, having the ""better"" weapon doesnt mean your gonna win.",pos
"I don't like the payment system at all because it's completely imbalanced.  There are ""pay-to-win"" items that can only be obtained with real money.  Unlocking the basic towers is also prohibitively expensive, but at least they can be unlocked by playing the game.I'm a huge fan of the Bloons games, so I still recommend this game because it is fun to play.  It's a fun time-waster from mobile that still looks really good on a big screen.",pos

"At it current state(1.81) is to expensive to play the game, if you don't have premium account you can't progress at all because of the repair cost and even if you do have you can't make mistakes if you want to have enough Silver Lions to buy another vehicle, stock vehicle are the worst, planes isn't that much but you still can feel a difference, the big problem here are mainly tanks were if you don't have repairs and FPE(extinguisher) you are useless if they get any of the parts of the tank unless you get to the capture point to repair (if they get your engine you can't do anything), matchmaking is too compressed so sometimes you get games where your tank or your plane lacks too much compared to others and still with the compression  takes some time to get into battle depending on your Rank(if you don't get a small game with 6-8 people, wich are decided on the first 3min of the game), this game have become a P2W or even worst than that because at it current state premium isn't helping that much, a premium vehicle and account are a must if you want to grind anything or even play(keep in mind that you can only reasearch vehicles of the same nation that your premium vehicle is), can't recommend this game at all anymore if you want to have fun and even spend money into something i would recommend World of Tanks(Warships or Planes) those games aren't perfect too,  but are in a better state or even buy a game from steam that will be better.",neg
"Early Access ReviewI've lost all respect now for the publishers, Tencent Games. I regret buying the founder's pack if you're just going to add a season pass and microtransactions. It's a shame too, because I enjoy this game a ton and it has a unique style which add to the fun experience. What was wrong with the crate system before? I loved this game because it wasn't trying to shove payments in your face like other battle royales (Fortnite, PUBG, etc...) but now that's changed. It's become like every other battle royale, a cash cow being milked to death. Although there are no issues I can find with the game, it's a bit frustrating to see the money I put into supporting this game just being used for stupid additions like microtransactions and the scam season passes are. How about a new map? New weapons? But no, there's just more cosmetics. There's no point in a rarity system because everything is given to you if you play the game. I preferred it before when you were awarded credits for doing well in your matches. The ridiculous experience system slows down the rate at which you can unlock new cosmetics, which is very unnappealing to new players, as they can only get 5-6 cosmetics before the season ends. At least you guys made the smart decision to let players keep the cosmetics they already had. It's really saddening to see that this is what I bought the founder's pack for and it's being used to create a system like V-Bucks and COD Points. If you want me to buy your microtransactions, bring back the free case system but allow those who help support the game to get some unique cosmetics. Please, Tencent. I really want to like this game because it had virtue before which was a nice breath of air from all the microtransactions modern games have. Please bring back the old system, but add new packs similar to the founder's pack. I cannot consider buying the battle pass because it's temporary and most of the cosmetics unlockable are recycled from the good ol' days of crates. This update truly scars the good nature that this game once had. The new UI makes things impossible to see in your inventory! Before, I had no issue seeing which gun had which attachment. This is a stupid issue that needs to be resolved, and I've never had this problem with any other game before. That aside, this game is extremely fun to play and very aesthetically pleasing. I would give the gameplay a 9/10, and only because of the tiny detail that the Ymir feels a bit slow in the beginning of the game.",neg

The modern tanks are all over the trailers but dont kid your self unless you are prepared to spend hundreds of pounds you will never reach them. So no i cant recomend this game not untill a massive reduction in grind time.Its a chame tho becasue the game is sound and fun and all the developers would have to do is too make an effort to reduce tyhe grind in a big way which could be as simple as the removal of silver lions or a massive and i mean massive reduction in research and lions costs. I know the entire community agrees with me on this so i dont see why the devs arent smart enough too see that their game will die without it. I mean just reed the recent reviews FFS. All that needs to happen is some major changes to the grind and it they will gain the loyalty of the player base back and start getting the great reviews they got a few years ago again.Until then tho its a game not worth anyones time.",neg
Early Access ReviewI can't recommend this game just because there is so many issues that  ruin the game.1. the tanks are just so annoying spawn killing you from miles across the map with Cheap♥♥♥♥♥ammo it ruins mathes2. they incrased the anti tank ammo cost so not only will you lose money trying to take a tank out but it cost 100x the price of a tank shell.3. hit boxes are joke they say it server lag your computer lag blah blah blah. However I can only beleive that so much espically when you shoot point blank range and AIM down sight with your smg and fire 15-30 rounds yet only about 7 actually detect that not lag that bad hit boxes.4. Hit boxes again when you hit someone they magically take no damage5.leveling up to get gear/ unit since last build is a joke I mean it will take something like 1 million xp to get from 12-13 with an average of 3k if your a good player per match will take you months and thats not even last level6. Maps can be one sided depending on what lanes are open 7. anti tanks mines are just stupid on how they are used you sneak up behinde a tank plant a mine run away and shoot it(assuming you actually got up that close without getting shot at)8. Lack of anti air planes can domiate maps at times because inf don't have anything to take planes out expect AA guns which do very little damage.Now there are good things as well but till they sort out the major issues in the game i say avoid Espically the hit boxes one the rest if you play smart you can get around it. However the reason I left was due to annoying hit boxes which they claim is no issue it is just server lag. ,neg

The vehicles need some work, as the handling doesn't quite seem realistic. The game is very similar to your typical BR, but with a lot of quality of life enhancements. Once they bring back to original Beta map I'll be a little more excited.I have about 400+ hours on PUBG and quit playing it months ago. Absolutely loved the game, just got bored of it. Played some Fortnite, but hated the building. I'll be playing this one for a good bit, it feels like an optimized version of PUBG, but more ""arcadey.""",pos

"Early Access ReviewI played this game when it first came out and I was like, oh this is a good game, then I would play it for a little while, then I stopped. After a while it had a major update, so I played it again, and I was like oh, this is a good game still, it may not be as good as it was, but its still good. I played it some, and stopped.  Then there was another update, so i played it and i was like oh, this is S**T!!!!!! WHY THE H*LL WOULD THEY ADD THIS DUMB A** POWDER SYSTEM, THE DEVELOPERS MUST HAVE BEEN SNORTING SOME POWDER IF THEY THOUGHT GETTING RID OF THE MONEY AND ADDING SOME CRAFTING POWDER WAS A GOOD IDEA.Message to the developers: if you want to make a good game, that is fun and have players enjoying it, don't get greedy, please get rid of the whole pay to win thing and bring back the original formula, please and thank you",neg

"Early Access ReviewIn a nutshell:DirectX9 only compatible (2002)Unreal Engine 3 = worst optimization + looks like crap150$ CE Edition Wing Effect isn't even workingJust don't bother at all.Refund if you still can, my best advice I can give you for this game.",neg
"By far the best combat flight simulator there is... BUT !DCS is not a finished product. The game crash on a regular basis and online play can be very laggy. In game tutorials and campaigns become buggy with constant game updates and so on. The game requires expensive top of the range hardware and very good internet connection to be really enjoyable. If that's what you have, go for it!If money is an issue for you - dont spend it on DCS as long as the developers don’t feel confident proclaming it ”Released”!",neg
"Brawlhalla is the greatest game ever made. It's that simple. Using items in competitive play may seem like this game is for filthy casuals, but actually, this game is for intelectuals, like myself that enjoy masterfully crafted games.  Rivals? More like Brawlhalla. That game iz 2 herd so ima play dis gem now k thx. 11/10",pos
"I ranked 2 one season, mainly because i didn't play enough and i have 75% of the cards with a lot of hours.Yes, this is the hearthstone we all wanted, it is perfect.But why the negative review?Because of the expansion, it made some insane cards with some insane effects like 20 mana when i had 9, destroy 4 creatures and heal 25, summon creatures from his graveyard, a support that gives a 0/1 creature for the enemy to kill and refill their health....and so much more i encounted when i played today at rank 5.Now....i could still win games with my decks but the games i lost were so terible that it makes me say that this is pay to win, pay to play without rage.If you don't play about 5 hours every day for a month or invest money in this......don't bother it's not going to be fun....or maybe you like the singleplayer aspect? you can play a lot of singleplayer",neg
"Early Access Review+Generous in terms of card acquisition.+Marvelous deckbuilding in terms of design and creativity: it can allow broken combos and you need a lot of expensive cards sometimes, but quite cool. (In the game you can have up to 4 copies of each card per deck, still I said it's really free-to-play).-Automacic mulligan. You can keep it, or draw a full new hand, a little frustrating and ""not in your hands"".-Resource mechanic (sigils, a.k.a. as mana, lands, etc in other games) is kinda broken, Magic style, not horrible, but somehow annoying. You can have 8 resource cards and nothing to play or the opposite easily.It's early access but it's a desing flaw they should fix.The only signigicant flaw I can notice is the same as before, where building a deck is certainly a very fun and interesing experience, playing it's not a lot more than clicking avaiable cards for your turn and keeping a couple of reactive spells in hand.I learned quite a bit about deep mechanics and the game has a lot, a lot of super powerful combos, wich makes even bigger the feeling of only one person destroying the other, either you or your opponent. This makes the resource system somehow not that big of a problem, but still frustrating sometimes.Still, it's worth a try in my opinion, but keep in mind deckbuilding is very deep and fun, and actualy playing is as hard as saying the alphabet. It has a ""Gaunlet"" mode wich is like a ""Versus IA arena"" you can enter for free and earn some cards and gold so, I would recommend trying it a little bit.",pos
"I get why Free to Play games have purchases to make the grind easier, and some custom skins and what not.But this isn't a grind when you cannot gain EXP from Solo PvE at all, and if you go PvP, you will get slaughtered. Grind should always start gradual, not a steep curve right from the first 15 minutes.",neg
Sometimes you will be walking down a hall and the hall will gradually get smaller and you will feel fear and it will be a horrific experience before the red man appears. Once the red man appears the only way to beat the game is to press Esc and the down arrow key and enter. I won very easily,pos
"♥♥♥♥ this game. It's gorgeous and addicting. The grind is extreamly long and many of the vehicles aren't balanced or historically accurate. The models in the game are amazing looking as is the customization. The game is massively frustrating as many people (not just I) go round after round of being killed to never achieve anything. I once played 10 rounds in a row of just being slaughtered, no kills, no captures. Being sniped from accrosed the map in Tier 2-3 games before I could even do anything. I want so hard to like and enjoy this game and it instead makes me want to throw my monitor acrossed the room. To counter point, I have had rounds with many kills and capturess, they're just few and far between. Having played most FPS' since the early 90's, I'm experienced enough to know when a game just isn't worth playing. Sorry War Thunder, I'm done with you.",neg
