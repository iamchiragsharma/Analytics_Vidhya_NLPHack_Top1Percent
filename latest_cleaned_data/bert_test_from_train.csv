40,this game have get to have one of the bad tutorial mode i have experience so far i have be do the tutorial and campaign for two hour now and i still do not know how many of the mechanic work the tutorial itself feel throw together and not plan out the story they try to tell you sound boring and i personally would have prefer the game to not tell you any of those picture story at all or at least provide proper narration since the voice acting can not even remotely compare to that of hearthstone instead of tell you straight up what the actual battle phase be and what you can or can not do they make you go through the trouble of only be able to use the highlight card even though you can play other card in the actual game mode sometimes you be allow to play card before attack sometimes you be not but they will not tell you why that be the individual card skill be not explain properly and i personally struggle a lot because the voiceover itself be in english while i be force to play the game with german sub flavour text as there be no option of use english only or german only neither in the game setting nor in the steam setting this make any sort of immersion into the game extremely difficult the language setting thing be more of a complaint towards steam though and not so much to eternal as i have the same problem when play the witcher and some other game i do hope that they will release the english language pack for other country though anyways i have play hearthstone since beta and enjoy it until a year ago when i quit because of the greedy blizzard ecosystem where you either pay up or play mindless aggro deck i also use to play lot of yu gi oh and some mtg when i be little and some gwent after i quit hearthstone yet i be still have trouble with the eternal ruleset because of their badly think out tutorial system i decide that i will give it another 2 hour or so of playtime and see if the experience change somewhat or stay the same i must say so far i be rather disappointed i get that the game itself be suppose to offer more depth than hearthstone while not be as deep as mtg but should not they at least have give you a smooth start into the game instead of force you to play only highlight card for an hour while barely explain the mechanic or at least which mechanic trigger first so far i be everything else but impressed with the game it have some good core mechanic but somehow feel way too rush out like they need another month or two to polish it up properly,neg

59,free to play without constantly be bug with microtransaction overall it be a solid game and with the number of god it take quite a bit of time to really learn how their ability can work together i would consider this game relatively easy to pick up and play but it will take you some time to really master the fine detail give it a shot its free and if you happen to hate it you can just delete it,pos
60,fractured space have come a long way since i first start play this game at the time of this review i have 155 hour play since its free to play release here be my thought on the game while loosely format around a moba it do not necessarily feel like i be play a moba rather fs play more like conquest in battlefront 2 you fight the enemy for control over certain area which lead to gain control of the battlefield and eventual victory i have yet to play battlefront 3 so i can not make a comparison there while the mission do not change the way you play can widely vary base on your ship selection and team composition each ship feel balanced however some ship or class of ship read stealth and sniper have steep learning curve on how to actually contribute to the game unlike some other game when edge case reveal new content especially new ship i get excited to play again unfortunately with a lot of new change come bug many of which have be persistent there be also some feature which i feel should be include but be not in game voice chat would be huge as well as a server browser to allow player to fill in for an ai pilot that be say i feel like edge case have be put forward a lot of honest effort to get the game to where they and the player want it to be pro fun blow away capitol ship be awesomegameplay reward skill and teamworkbalanced ship and content mostly mean this avoid be a pay to winall ship available on standard currency and currency grind be fairly easyrelatively consistent update with exciting contentgreat community available on reddit and discordcon bugslack of certain feature such as voice chat or server browsingpremium currency though with this be a ftp i have no problem support the dev saltclose thought my review here be lack some information as i have never actually play the second game mode frontier since this game be ftp there be no harm in give the game a try and you may actually end up enjoy it overall i would recommend this game to anyone who like pilot big ship and blow up other ship,pos

64,early access reviewi can not reccomend this game after 250 hour of game time the content be release excrutiatingly slow the matchmaking if you can call it that be the bad i have ever see e g during the current event i be rank 999th and get match with no joke the current top rate in the world constant mana screw flood this game be just a random luck simulator imo regret play every any second be warn,neg
65,this game be get slam for its business model and to that point there be some valid gripe the game be not really f2p and the free version should only be advertise as a demo and not a particularly good one the good way to play the game be to purchase a starter pack when if you do the game be phenomenal in its presentation and gameplay animal react as realistically as you could expect the scenery weather be beautiful and weapon handling be spot on there be ton of skill to learn as you go after different animal and the frustration patience factor be just high enough to make your harvest reward without make you rage quit,pos
66,early access reviewa year and a half ago and i would of thoroughly recommend this game but after recent update my opinion towards this game have change drastically with an almost entirely new combat system now allow bot to have more than one weapon type which completely break the nature of the game i like the idea of free loot etc after a game to ease the process of get item for your bot however the removal of the tech tree with the tier star be a bump downhill and really where my dislike for the game happen i could go on for much longer but i fear i would bore those of you read this review so i will put it nice and clear at the end here for you do not play the game they turn it into a load of,neg
67,most generous ccg i have ever play because you can earn dust vs the ai you can grind an epic card in about one day and a legendary card every 4 day this make this an extremely fun game to play as f2p if there be an awesome deck that you do not have the card for you can grind them up in a very reasonable amount of time this be my go to ccg and i have try them all i can not wait for the mobile release this summer,pos
68,early access reviewfracture space be a good idea but i do have some critisizms for the game1 when you leave the battle without ther game end there should be some reward not 0 credi and 0 ship research points2 there should be a way to have a matchmaker create game base on your ship and not you choose what game to joinplease note that i do get the game while it be during the free weekend where if you download it then you get to keep that copyi persionally be neutral about this game mean i do not hate and i do not love the game this be my review of fractured space nuclear poptart,pos

72,i try almost every simulation outh there include iracing and i be excited for a new simbin title cuz i be a fan of simbim from way back with gt legends and gtr gtr2 so i be expect a good sim inste i get some acrila car that u can not get use to just like iracing u can not feel the road u can master a track but u can not master the grip its just unconecte no way neer gtr ad gtlegends and race07 i do not care about graphic so that s my opinion on phisic and engine a big fail from me but i understand they wanna make it more fun and driver frendly but in there aprouch the have miss me now a little bit of a content rewievit not a free game its a demo if u want a game with content u have to buy it and its not cheep i hate it its like star citizen sell u a model of something and price it not as much as star citizen but still its a 3d model and when 10 000 ppl buy it u end u with 50 000euro in cash do it cost that much to designe a 3d model of a car no so what be it a rip off be what it be they do not want to make a game that s why u can not play it standalone with no internet conection they wann sell stuff like star citizen cuz they have see the amoun of money sc earn robe off kid with money i be ok with that rip off all kid with money i could not care less but u will not get it from me i want a racing simulation that will work even if my internet connection be down i want to pay for a game not a car or a track i could not care less what track name be or what car be i drive as long as its a nice track and a good car phisic so i play would play rfactor with unlicensed car and track that work good rather then pay 200e for raceroom that have all licensed car that u can not feal and have to pay for a door panel and tyer that s what it boild down too they would sell i virtual wheel and windshield if they could but they can not so they sell car and track i be not in too that so what be the alternativesalternativesgsc as game stock car 2013 be a well sim on every level exept multipayer but that will improove when ppl realise that its the good sim on the market apart from irace that so expensive u can not even consider it in a category of 20 30e and do not feel as good as gscalso aseto corsa be well then race room and its cheeper but its not finish so that s my review boil down too if u have money there be no reason not to try to buy content but if u suport financial model like that u will end up pay for wind shield rim and car skin maybe even p2w like high octane fuel if u be smart u will suport game that do not try to get as much money from u but insted focuse on give u a pleasure of racing against ai and ppl with as much content as u like with mod oficial content etc so for me there be just gsc 2013 and aseto corsa that be on that level of racing i race too but that s for profesional driver not for a casual gamer race room expirience be a money generate machine not a racing simuator just like world of tank be star citisen and all other so call free game thank u simbin for not exist any more and make room for real racing gamer over at asetto corsa and gsc over and out,neg

76,decent game not perfectly balanced one of the well card game you can play it on android gwent be way well than it but hard to compare the two really if gwent be on steam and android it would overtake this by a long shot though the new expansion should breath life back into this game though it have a magic the gathering feel but with well mechanic not too complex easy to play than gwent and more convienent sorry for the comparison but those be the top two card game right now beside crapstone that do not balance their whole game so that will never be play again,pos

118,unfortunately i can not give all you new player who be hopefully dive in to this with its release an up to date opionion on start out but 1 5 year ago start out be quite easy and afaik not much and nothing drastically impactful have change since you be get nice starter deck and draft ticket and also you have daily pack quest to save for league seal or draft and two ai mode to grind for gold and pack also puzzle at least one of those should be your taste and take you on the road the game have a great community surround it and if you be willing to take your time and a few hint you get online then you be pretty safe to have a very good f2p experience which i myself have as well besides the world have an interesting flavor in my opinion and direwolf digital really step up their game with monthly promo card that you earn along the pack for your first daily win and story back them up the campaign anachronistically add a lot of great twist to the main story and character introduce through promo card that already catch your attention may be visit again which imo do a great deal to grant immersion also community resource be at a peak of availability and creativity you be also go to get ingame reward if you be catch the community stream the developer have a good sense of humor and they be do a great job in balance and advance the game properly and enjoyably give it a try if you want to be flexible and keep your investment low while still enjoy a top ccg this game deserve a chance,pos

124,tbh this game have alot of potential it be a pretty good game different enough from minecraft the graphic be very good the soundtrack be amazing the night sky be just oh so magical the corruption layer be hard as it should be and it be very scary as it should be the enemy be pretty nice and fun and definetly more dificult than any enemy in minecraft now let us look at the bad thing the recepy thing can get pretty annoying because you need to craft something that can be pretty expensive to get something you really need which can be pretty annoying but nothing horrible there be no goal at all yes there be some hide story in this but that be really not what you could call a goal i mean you can set yourself a goal but i mean that be pretty i do not want to be rude but that be kinda lame other than that this game have alot of potential and i hope the next update will bring many more thing not like the steampunk update that do not bring almost anything except for people who be able to purchase thing for money,pos
125,access reviewi rarely write review on steam but this game really deserve a good review okay so i be go to write my review the way i would love someone to write it general feeling that be beautiful my graphic card be middle low end and even with graphic set on low the game be a beauty the snow seem so real the feeling be so smooth that s amazing the concept be great not too many people in the battle royale only 60 per game and 4 final spot of winner in a chopper which be very realistic love that gameplay nice battle royale without bug without stupid dance or craft wood hum hum and a realistic snow style scenario enough people to be worry not enough to die instantly perfectly balanced as all thing should be personnalisation be huge aiming be fine realistic ballistic far ennemie you got to shoot a little high due to distance fluidity be really something that be miss for me in pubg and i be stun with the fluidity of ring of elysium graphic if you can not afford steep here be a free version you can snowboard in the snow of climb a cliff even paraglide your way to the safe zone and it be insanely beautiful sometimes i stop my chase and just look around the beautiful environment i can not even immagine what this game look like in extra graphic setup community great community on reddit and in official forum even in game i try to go with a team of 3 people and they be very friendly mute option push to talk option you be even ready if mr boring be in your team you can play it solo still very enjoyable you can play it duo that s for me the good and in a 4 group funny but not very serious depend on your mate pro and con graphic 17 20 free and no pay to win 20 20 smooth and accurate aim 19 20 realistic scenario 18 20 you can choose between third person or first person game 20 20 lobby matchmaking quickness and fairness 16 20 sometimes it go until 1 minute to find a game a total access to our statistic but not where we shoot in someones body etc 15 20 only one map beautiful tho 11 20 only one mode but its beta and more be come 13 20 so far only 60 people per game which be nice but a mode with 100 250 etc would be fun 13 20 a tier level style evolution but no ranking point and no competitive rank 11 20that be it but the general conclusion be that it be a wonderful game do not miss it out,pos

130,the game itself can certainly be enjoyable at time but 90 of your time will be take up by the long and boring grind for vehicle and their module which most require to even function properly this be only make bad by a dev team that continue to completely ignore and then openly mock the playerbase whenever they raise legitimate concern italian tank be tease month ago and still we have nothing world war mode be probably never come development on naval force be at a minimum and air battle have see no meaningful development in year on top of all this almost all new content be top tier tank for the already crowd german soviet and american tree whilst the small british french and japanese tree get nothing the dev do not care about the player or the game they just want to squeeze as much money out of you as they can before the game die edit thank to the recent controversy gaijin have finally start to implement 1 or 2 positive change so there be a dim light at the end of the tunnel,neg

133,this new interface be finally less buggy than the main dcs simulation modulle use to be run very well if your rig be at least 2 5 ghz dual core with the new nv 560 ti type card and 4 gb ram or well load time can still be 2 to 5 min for each new senario startup or multiplay code must compile something realtime or some thing or game space be setup as binarry arrays or math matracie or the like but wow be the simulation realisum and mutiplay senario worth it when it finally load absolutly unreal if your a fan of detailed aircraft simulation highly recommend and 1st module the su 25 t be free on steam now,pos
134,it feel almost sad to me to watch tf2 now sure it be still more of the same but i can not help but feel that the love that be once there be not there anymore this game be what pull me from xbox to pc so why do i just feel pity for this game run on for so long when i use to want to watch it become an unstoppable titan on pc with no end in sight i think it stem back to what i would call the peak of tf2 in my time of be around which i feel be love war because i remember how the game that be just become a little too stale get the big injection of life and fun with new taunt weapon and all around great memory however i notice something off after a week or so the community be become 2 faction and i have never see this before one side want to conga and party the other want a hardcore pub server every match i keep on playing though when a trailer name end of the line come out my hype be beyond contain and i think up so many weapon i have see that will possibly come to life on update day i have so many thought of how this be the update to end the game one last bang with everything and anything we could want or need when finally on december 8th we be hit with a crush reality where this update that have so much hype for turn into a simple cosmetic update and i be crush i keep play though with a pit in my stomach the new update roll out with quite a split gun mettle cs go skin in tf2 and people think the world be end and to top it off this update be a pay to play update to start the campaign however i be love every second of the new group tanut and the snowplow map not to mention i be in love with some skin like all good thing though i be quickly bring back down to sadness when invasion hit it have sound like there would be new weapon and a new game mode from all the hype the game mode be average at most and the reskin turn my love for the game to anger and i leave for payday for quite a while i return midway in the tough break update when i see a similar but different game the magic be just go for me at this point and soon enough other game catch my eye mainly overwatch where tf2 grow stale with me other people keep go i full departure from tf2 be meet your match when i feel as if tf2 change so drastically to just compete with overwatchs rapid growth in competitive play sure i have be read and it look like tf2 be back to how it be be for 9 year just with a different hat stack on it be head again i be not say you should quit tf2 because overwatch be just well or anything i just want to explain about how i break away from this game and thing i feel after 4 year on this game and many disappointment so if you enjoy tf2 still then more power to you and if you hate tf2 with a burn passion then i do not care about that either all this review be for be to say my peace about tf2 before i be do with it for good,neg
135,horrible game but it could be so good here be how the game go 1 get resource stabilized2 deal with random emergency fire roach infestation mole thing infestation raider 3 use most of your resource to heal your people4 run a mission5 slowly growth your shelter6 goto 1 it would not be so bad but 2 in the list be so obviously deliberate attempt to stifle growth attempt to have you buy a microtransaction it also would not be bad if there be some type of ai that would deal with the current random emergeny for example if you have a fire in a room with no one in it you have to manually drag a person to that room to fight the fire when he be do put out the fire he will just stand there even if the fire move right next door until you either move him again or all fire be put out move the people with a mouse be also very touchy clunky at time in the time it take me to write this review i have 2 random incident occur a massive fire and a massive mole rat outbreak just make some repetitive just to drain resource do not make for a challenge it just make it grindy and boring,neg
136,early access reviewgame be awesome till the new update i spend 1 week of daily play to buy 1 freaking gun its no fun anymore i can not just buy what i need anymore get to play freakin 3 hour to buy 1 stupid thing game use to be fun do not waste your time till they fix it,neg
137,a decent to good game ruin by some annoying mechanic and a small rather hostile playerbase with limit variety good gameplay overall be really good the ship be slow and require some patience they be suppose to be big hulking capital ship the combat be pretty good as well bad variety 2 mode conquest and frontline conquest have 2 lane towards the enemy base with a middle lane for a bonus fight every few minute frontline be basically the same thing but with only one lane and no middle bonus fight mechanic so you have 2 mode that both have the same similar mechanic and objective if you do not like one mode you will not like the other ship stealth some ship have stealth which in and of itself be not a bad thing the problem be that they drag the game down and be just unfun to play against game like dota2 do stealth right where you have some hero who counter stealth in and of themselves which this game have but they also have item you can buy and deploy to reveal those hero which this game do not have so if the enemy team draft a team you can not switch ship mid match and you can not see what the enemy be bring and you do not have one of the few ship that have a reveal skill you be sol double or tripple the frustration when compare to dota2 because you also have a 3 dimensional space your stealthed enemy could be it be just not a good game setup as it have lock in ship where you can not see the enemys draft but no option to counter if you do not draft one of those few counter ship yourself sound game audio be mediocre ship fire sound rather lackluster playerbase it be no secret that the game suffer from a lack of player the problem be that in the few recent pvp match i have play people be rather hostile that may not be an issue if the game have a decent playerbase but if you run into someone you do not like be prepare to see them in the next 20 match because odd be you will fight them again and again beyond that find a match for me have take everything between 1 minute and 10 grind unlock ship do not seem so bad but i also buy into the game early access and so have a lot of credit store up however ship range between 300k credit and 1mil credit while you earn about 10 15k each match it just feel like too much of a grind for me and that be before you buy the sidegrade for the weapon and ability the ship may have menu omg i hate the menu system in here such a pain to visit the hanger and find a ship as you have to scroll through a small little menu window to find it there be some filter but they do not help as much as you would think overall the menue be all convoluted and fill up way too much of the screen offer too little information and still manage to feel overwhelming overall the gameplay be good but it feel like half a game with some rather unfortunate design decision,neg
138,early access reviewoverall a great game after several playing need to fix a little bit about accuracy and speed on shoot maybe after release we can get new skin new mount or new chicken overall it be a great game,pos
139,i play this game before it launch on steam it be okay it be 90 hearthstone with some new mechanic and fast ramp to mid game the promotion of card where card you own get permanently impprove feel like a mechanic that give long time player a serious edge over newcomer which may be a problem in the future but it be free and very generous in dispense card pack so there be very little to keep you from just try it yourself edit after play this game some more i be now of a mind to caution people about what they be get into i like the gameplay far more than i do hearthstone as there be a lot more dynamic on the board through heavy removal and influencer but i do agree that it be p2w or at least as much as hearthstone be once you get through the newbie rank you will start hit the opponent with more legendarie and promote card some build have more than 10 legendarie in them and they be legendary for a reason on the flip side the cost of craft card be the same as in hearthstone while the chance of draw a card be considerably less tesl use 50 card deck so 1 50 at the start of the game this mean that craft card have less impact on a build and it will take long to catch up to the people who decide to spend money on pack and exclusive ie card you will never get if you do not pay for them i still enjoy the game and i hope you will too it be just a shame that this balance issue be weave so deeply into the business model of this game,neg

144,early access reviewdont waste your time and money on thisjoke of a game i play it for around 27 hour this week and that be time i be never get back unless you like play for hour on end without unlock anything only be able to buy the starter garbage weapon and jeep and like be spawn camp by tank and sniper all day the dev of this game be try so hard to force you to buy your way to power instead of actually play the game 0 10 untill the dev start make a real game decide to give the game another go to see if it get well spoiler it do not this game get bad every damn time you play it the game be full of bug such a bolt action rifle look like the they shoot twice so the shot you intend to hit some go into the next postal code complete broken spawn system its also super easy for one person in a heavy tank to spawn camp your entire team most battle end in either total stalemate or a massive blitz that smash one team at this point it seem like the only thing that actually work in this game be the insanely overpriced store where you can buy yourself all the power in the world only if you be dumb enough to even give these dev a penny for this joke of a game i have a really hard time understand why anyone would ever support the dev or this game what so ever when all they care about it take your money and clearly not use it to improve the game at all 4 year of be in beta should give you a pretty good idea of how little the dev care about their playerbase save your self the time and disappointment this game be and move on,neg
145,early access reviewi really want to like this game but it be hard there be a problem with the design 75 card deck with 4 of a kind rule remove consistency and the mana screw flood issue also cause significant frustration you even have to build your deck with min 40 of your card just deal with mana sigil problem and even then most of the time you have screw flood lose a game without even play be not fun it be really frustrating,neg
146,note thehunter be a niche game it be a wonderful niche game do not get me wrong but other than the gameplay itself i have nothing but issue with it compare this game to the big name game out there cod bioshock farcry skyrim and so forth ignore the genre production value and sale be what i be compare here in all of these big name game have one thing in common you buy the game you can play it all of it you unlock gear and item as you play through you do not have to buy additional junk just to complete mission progress through the game occasionally you will have expansion or add on more dlc that you can buy that will in most case extend the gameplay but in all case will at least net you more content of some kind so i will take cod one of the best know most loved and high selling franchise in the gaming industry i think i pay 60 when it first come out that be it for the whole game all equipment all level and weapon attainable for that 60 oh i forgot to mention that you own the game at that point you do not have to buy a membership to enjoy all of the game content now thehunter free to play no it be not mistitle it be deceptively title the f2p portion conain one rifle one scope a bleat call a camera a gps and binocular oh that be fine and all but you only get to hunt one animal mule deer on one reserve if anything it be a free demo if you expect to see the rich content in this game forget it this demo be nothing more than a snapshot ok so that be what you have get for free let us spend 60 on this game like we would any other and see where it get us 45 for one year basic and another 15 for three more month that be it that be what you get i would love to say that you get more but you do not you get 15 month with no additional gear no additional weapon oh you do get the option to hunt on all the reserve you also gt the licence to hunt all of these animal but you still can not because you have not buy the proper weapon proper ammo proper equipment so you have to shell out more money just to take advantage of the fact you just shell out 60 for 15 month of play time what be that do i just hear someone squeak the word world of warcraft deny wow at least give you access to all of it be content after you have pay your subscription and no i be not go to complain about the subscription as wow be be an mmo get to maintain those server yeah i know thehunter have multiplayer big deal out of the 20 people who enjoy multiplayer thehunter could loose all 20 of them and still be a perfectly great game as single player only you guy want to make more money add the cottontail and a crappy shot gun to the free to play version and call it a free demo sell the game for 30 and monthly membership of 5 make gear and weapon unlockable get rid of the microtransaction garbage i would buy this game for 30 i would pay a 5 subscription if i have access to all of the game content after i make those purchase that be at least 35 you guy would have make from my first month 5 and maybe even more a month after for my continue subscription however due to the way you guy have decide to sell this game i have spend 15 for the subscription have my fill becasue i refuse to spend more money on trivial and temporary purchase and that be it you have make 15 from me and you will not make any more i do not recommend this game sure download it shoot a few mule deer and call it quit for the price you will be pay to make anything in this game available for use and the fact that these be only temporary purchase subscription consumable this game be not worth the disk space it occupy even with wow purchase when it be release and play for the first year at about 180 be still cheap than this you want a good hunting game play cod or farcry or bioshock you get to hunt people and monster you get ton of weapon to choose from you do not have to pay a monthly subscription and your purchase be yours to keep do not spend a dime on this game,neg

155,great game do take some money if your lazy impatent and weak willed because in the mobile you can do some offer i stop play the game for a week just to get 2000 gem kinda be worth it cause i get 5 dragon battle for the edge expansion pack the mini game pack aswell though the battle for the edge be kinda short wish it be long for how it take me to get the gem to buy it but it also give me the ability of hideout aka a house on dragon edge you can decorate its a cool idea so the game could be classify as a pay to enjoy but i spend no money on and i be do pretty good so no need to break the bank just go to mobile complete some offer i spend well over the hour that s on steam cause i play mobile alot more sense its more convient so i would recommend the game to little kid or people who be hard work and will compelete the offer for gem it be a great game like i say but need more to do and more big storyline plot like expansion that you do not need to buy just like get a expansion that s part of game by get like a certain amount of udt ultimate dragon trainer point and add more quest that be just go get this fish or this plant and add like quest for island from expansion that be unlock after buy the expansion but do not have anything to do with the story the whole island locking thing kinda limit the quest creativity but over all if you can get past the part of need to work or spend money its a great game wonderful graphic so go ahead and download if your a true fan of httyd then this game be perfect for you and you should get over the flaw of money,pos

163,to be 100 honestly this game be addict and fun however that s for the first 100 hour then the fun go away and begin the hour of grind to get enough loin or enough rp to get anything above the br battle rate 5 3 the good part be when you get the vehicle have fun try to break even when you get one or maybe two kill per game it get bad when you get into game 6 7 and up yet for real world money you can get a premium account for xx amount of time and golden eagle with premium you can join a game die and still make loin with rp do not want to put the time or work in just buy golden eagles then you can now increase your rp or loin and even buy premium vehicle and yes its a free to play game and they need a way to make money however with problem like skill cap be too high for some br and matchmaking be a joke have fun be up tier 70 of the time i do not see why they should push microtransaction when they be many part of the game that need work but it new plane and premium tank for only 40 00 should be the high priority,neg

173,graphic be ok but the grass be terrible i would crouch down and it would have me stick look in one spot the whole time adn when i try to move it would move my gun and not my body i like the feel of the game but as some of the other review say you need a license to do everything it be stupid go buy cabelas big game hunter instead because at least you can have some kind of fun with that 2 10 would get stuck and only allow to move my arm again,neg
174,if you search pay to win in the dictionary a picture of this game show up literally every aspect of this game at some point you will need to put at least some money into this game be mostly popular for its pvp and that be incredibly difficult to be good at and again you will need to pay money to get well gear since that be all this game be about gear also it be now full of mexicans and koreans and you be lucky if you run into someone who speak proper english overall it be a solid game it be just that you need to have money to enjoy it fully,pos
175,well if you plan to go to war thiss a must fer starter otherwise better get world of household tool sissy boy cause its just a pixel hunting quest to make you feel manly,neg
176,i have not get to play the game yet even though it do say i have 0 8 hour on it my friend tell me to wait when the launcher come up so i do then the launcher will either close out or close out and the game will open the game either do not respond be completely black screening or just close as soon as i click on it from what i have see it be a good game but let me play the game for goshs sake and on my pc i have to use task manager to close steam and restart it because when the game close it literally force me to use task manager because it still say it be run and i can not play any other game,neg
177,early access reviewwhat start as a great creative game with a few cash option have be twist into an unadulturated cash grab on the level of mobile game i start play this game essentially as soon as it be release its have its teething problem no doubt and balance issue be understandable i stick with the game through those issue because hey its hard to balance a createive game but the most recent change where all of your income be basically a roll of the dice no skill require have do it for me it be clearly set up so that you can buy box or cash to buy part outright but you can no longer simply rely on your skill level to ensure a good income level therefore the advantage easily pass to people who be willing to buy their way to the good part tl dr be once about building be now about buy,neg
178,early access reviewwow this be unreal and i mean it the hit box and all it something to laugh at and then on top of that all the patchs the lil kid cry about and all get do and then do not get start on the hacker so many video out there show the hacking and all be so unreal and nothing be get do about it like after 1 or 2 day after a patch there be a video with new hack like they need to get something about that like hunt down the site and find out who be all do it unlike fortnite there sue the hacker not the maker and even ppl that show that there not do anything about the hacker and show it still work and all just like this game they do not care they want hacker to ban and get them to buy more of the game like pubg bc that mean more money and not to stop the hacker mean less money for them this right now issofar out of 10 game i have see 4 speeder and 4 to 5 aimbot more then half way accross the map like update the anti cheats every other day this will for sure stop more then 80 of them and ban them for good,neg
179,a one of a kind rough diamond i enjoy planetside 2 since the release and keep on do so untill it may run entirely out of player one day yet despite many people claim this game would die this day seem still to be year ahead i be always amazed about how dynamic battle can become when once you be in advantage siege a base just to be flank attack by a coordinated batallion of tank and aircraft drive you back to the wall of your own base that you have to defend desperately hour and hour of hard fight and fun this game offer everything a fps gamer could long for massive battle sneaky stealth mission to disable the enemy defense dog fight tank warfare a well execute squad and platoon system high reward for support duty like revive repair counter hacking and healing what ever role you want to play just do there be no limit on what ever kind of weapon and vehicle noone hold you back noone claim vehicle exclusively to them like in battlefield this game be purely for you to enjoy the way you want yet there be some consideration you have to make when get start the game offer you a fair beginner package of all weapon and equipment need to fulfill your class the beginner weapon be all jack of all trade master of none so keep that in ming when you encounter your first enemy with a shotgun up close also you have to consider that this game have some age behind its back and there be people who simply unlock way more equipment than you have and be better train in the mechanic of this game this may be frustrating at first yet as time progress you will grow and improve and so do your equipment it be not battlefield where you can unlock your entire class in a day this game be design as many mmofps rpg that the player stick to it for a while anyone who ever play a mmorpg like guildwar or wow will know that become one of the good consider the equipment involve time none the less this do not prevent you from beee able to have fun even though your own tank may lack the powerful secondary gun and utility equipment you can simply jump into a tank own by a experienced player and use it people play together in this game and people share their equipment simply ask in the world chat and someone will respond to you there be day when this game can be frustrating as so many player 300 at once in a battle can cause net code implication or it can simply be to much for a single player to process rocket fly more explosion than in a michal bay movie and pesky sniper everywhere just remember this game be yours if a battle become frustrating because you be outnumbered or the region start to stutter from all the people run around do not respawn time after time and bang your head against a wall at those time you can simply swap from the big battle into small skirmish of 20 player and enjoy a much calm match the map be huge after all and you have 4 entire continent for you to choose so if you be displeased then take a short break or simply join a small fight lastly if you ever feel that progression be to slow just join a platoon and squad usually community platoon leader use 50 exp boost to help out their mate since leader gain point from every player level up during their lead you will see that this help your grind tremendously and increase the chance of quality teamwork even further just when you start create a character on every faction play them until level 5 and decide on what faction to stick with though you can come back to other faction anytime you like weapon unlock be faction exclusive though unless buy with real money also keep in mind that this game really take a day to adapt to it you will die a lot in your first hour and this can become frustrating but the learning curve be exponential and when you only have 0 2 kill in your life at the beginning you can easily go beyone 15 kill later enjoy your time on auraxis,pos
180,this be the good thing that have happen to me i know a lot of people think it be a p2w game and that it be repetitive but if it be super easy to get everything then where would be the fun in that i think people should work to get thing and do the same thing over and over because that be basically what we do in real life we do the same thing over and over for our whole life only to enjoy 15 20 year of it in comfort so what i say to all the people who think it be a terrible game and be under the age of of 14 just know you will be do that exact same thing in the future,pos
181,early access reviewplaye when it be part of paladin for the day it be great and i like the change they make as a stand alone game too although it can often seem like nothing be happen which lead me to the only thing i would like to see do like a small map for more intense play and maybe some cross game currency and battle pass like my gold gem and bp on paladin should be link to both game as originally it be go to be one game i think all the fan would love this same with the mobile game maybe even some skin to idk how or if they could but it would be cool to see a buck skinned toon run around the realm,pos
182,i have be play this game for over 2 year now and it be possibly one of my favorite game hirez community be amazing and the only issue be the god balancing be askew sometimes,pos
183,i do not really like the tank but the plane be a good mixture of realism and arcade and be pretty fun i would recommend you play this game if you just wanna have some fun with the plane but the long term playability be crap it be super grindy to progress like it be more grindy to get top tier with 1 faction than to max a character in world of warcraft level of grindy so if you have fun in the mean time it be great but if you be after high tier either pull out that wallet or just skip it also though i come in later many reviewer say the plane have not see any major updating in year which be a shame some housekeeping may get me back in on it otherwise not so much,neg
184,early access reviewthis be one of those game that sound great in theory but be horrible as an actual game there be no balance what so ever to the point so few people bother to play the russians cause all their low end weapon be so bad they can not remotely match up with the other two faction the grind be really horrible as well to encourage you to spend money,neg
185,one of the bad car game i have ever play the visual aspect of the game be pretty good but with the controll of the car be really just terrible i wish they would make it a more controll frendly game and a bit more realistic 2 10,neg
186,this game sound really good so i download it it do not take that long so i think cool but when i get to the gameplay it be slow boring and they do not teach you anything you have to figure it out on your own and the gameplpay be so slow you can be walk jog because the running do not really count as run but back to the point you can be go around for hour and not find any animal and you have to pay to be able to hunt more than 2 different specie of animal it be such a waste of time really dissapointing ik i have not put much time into the game but so far it be bad,neg
187,early access reviewa bitreally no mouselook toggle gross as hell pay to res dynamic that would be bad in a f2p game but be shameful in a 50 dollar game terrible translation i would rather have in in korean so i could take the script as subtitle grindy as can be do like the pet and mount system but it be not enough to paper over the downside it all just feel cheap and gaudy,neg
188,i be an avid sim racer and a national karting racer so let us just get straight to the point graphic be good for a free game online ta competition that lead to prize a lot of variety of car microtransaction too pricey multiplayer seem lonely physic a bit arcadish,pos
189,early access reviewvery slick card game that sit in complexity between hearthstone and spellweaver what i appreciate most about it be the refined interface that allow you to play quickly without wait for animation to finish and to have access to all info you need about the various card effect the mtg inspire battle mechanic be pretty good as be the instant system which allow you to react to enemy instant stack effect until one player stop reply the only thing i sometimes wish for in spellweaver though that be definitely a tradeoff that will slow the game down when face some player the number of game mode available be also laudable everything from gauntlet vs the ai to rank to draft this say compare to spellweaver or hex i find browse the card collection quite yawn induce the effect on most card be not very inspiring to say the least they do not fire my imagination about potential synergy and combo like the former game do in the end i be recommend it as fast food it be easy to get into they even give you pre make deck regularly so you can just jump in without know a thing about deckbuilding and you will already be play something more interesting than starter deck,pos
190,i think this resemble hearthstone too much that say i have only play 2 or 3 game of hearthstone a long time ago in general i like the elderscrolls touch of everything and how they create the card for the specific race i mean there be some error or change for some race since morrowind but well my problem be the gameplay i be a fan of magic the gathering and i really do not like how you play legend or hearthstone even yu gi oh be more fun to play as the the genearl gameplay be more fun for me like how you attack and defend and all that jazz i think a lot of people who like magic will not like legend or hearthstone as a fan of elder scroll you still may want to play the story mode that s all that i can recommend as it stand now,neg
191,early access reviewman this game be just so fantastic i can not state how much free stuff this game give you between the generous ladder system to casual and draft craft cool card and play fun deck be always at your fingertip a nice departure from hearthstone and other stale ccgs and a great alternative to magic the gathering 10 10 would recommend,pos

193,this be a game that i have love since i stumble onto it it be an idle game but one that actually have a lot to do in the game and with the event it be something that seem like it may have a whole lot more to come the humor be good and play off of a lot of thing the progression be interesting with both specific challenge to push you further and the general free play one that just let you move forward in other way this game keep me play daily for over a year now with several thousand hour in,pos

196,early access reviewcollectible deckbuilding card game can be a lot of fun they be not however a legitimate form of mind to mind competition they be certainly enticing and stimulating to be sure the illusory pull of be able to come up with strategy and collect card to support that strategy building from a core idea into a set of technique and then unleash them in match test refine it all sound very cool the problem be in the internet era an individual effort just do not amount to much and furthermore there be far too much luck involve sure you can make progress as i have do with homebrew deck from time to time depend on whether the meta allow for the strategy i try but for the vast majority of player you must pay to win and bow to the whim of how the community be build its deck the specific game in the ccg genre all have their quirk but in every instance you be up against the meta the game be less about refine your own idea than it be about efficiently farm card to steal the idea of other that have be test in far more match than you could ever hope to play on your own it be about take advantage of momentary swing and imbalance in particular card combination look for a weak spot that will rocket you up a few more notch against a ton of other people try to do the same you be not test your own idea so much as test the idea of the community and its ever shift whim and then change tactic when you get counter i do not find the idea of try to eke out a more than 50 winrate with deck i do not make up very appealing nor do i like the idea that all my individual effort be mostly for naught when compare to a whole internet full of people use particular premade netdeck that far outclass me throw hundred of dollar at the game to get all the card they need sure i can try to scrape something together and compete i can appropriate their technique but all i be do be play the odd hope i draw into lucky string of card to make my combos work hope they do not draw into theirs hope that if we both draw into our deck ultimate concept that mine trump theirs in the meta that they be not set up to counter me i have do pretty well with my homebrew deck but once you be mire in the silver rank you will start run into deck use enormous amount of synergistic legendarie that be most likely buy with real money sometimes draw luck be on your side other time it be not do not get me wrong this be still fun a lot of the time but it be not a direct competition between mind there be too much other crap in the way there be a certain amount of skill involve in play the card deck correctly but at their heart ccgs be a matter of who have the time and the luck who be willing to steal the good idea efficiently compare the strategy in ccgs to the strategy find in a game like go for instance where every piece have the same property and the rule be very simple with no randomness yet the depth of potential strategy be so all consume that people dedicate their whole life to the game and the game be capable of open itself up to high and high level of play as you progress in a card game the piece you even have access to be base on either your wallet or grind out the hour in a sense this may be similar on the surface in that more time more power but there be no set of piece you unlock by study go for 1000 hour that will automatically win game for you once they be all out on the board you be never stick with piece in your bowl that be unplayable because you lack some other amount of power or find that you reach into the bowl and there be no stone in there to draw out and play your idea have a direct expression on the board at all time and the well your idea the strong your purpose and the more efficient your play the better you be at the game in a direct correlation so all that say eternal be still a pretty good example of a game in this genre it be pretty close to m tg and have a lot of great element that make it shine with a hell of a lot less rng than say hearthstone the attacking and block mechanic engender some interesting mindgame and back and forth but it be still a collectible card game at the end of the day and bind by those same limitation i will finish this out by say that while i still do play eternal quite a lot and i usually enjoy my time with it i can only provisionally recommend it to those who be willing to put up with the usual pay to win collectible card game frustration present in every example of this genre if you be up for struggle quite a bit against factor outside of your control for the sake of the occasional dopamine rush of an earn win intersperse with a lot of unearned win and loss well you could do bad than eternal it certainly while away the hour and what more can we ask for i would also like to pose a somewhat rhetorical question what would be so bad about give all player access to all card right from the start and charge a reasonable price to purchase the game or provide the player with an option to draw card instead of take an action like infinity war do then much more of your success or failure would rest on your own ingenuity rather than rng and time money spend just unlock the ability to play the game or get screw out of power or card draw,neg
197,this be one of the great game ever conceive by a group of mortal mans mind so many option so many people an almost perfect simulation of war work as a team to take down your enemy in a gigantic landscape by foot tank or air this game be not gentle and will easily scare weak minded and yellow bellied scardy cat away with its immence battle and epic perfection i have personally watch a level 5 greenhorn yell profusely to his comrade to shoot him in his face because he have no idea what be go on good part be that it be free and not a pay to win 90 of everything you pay for be for vain selfish and stupid reason ilke helmet that look cool that you can not see yourself so you just have to hope your squad be tell you the truth that you look cool or you can buy a camo the semi work or you can buy a make up kit if you be the dirty dirty vanu scum you can buy gun with cert that you can earn for playing or just pay a few buck to get a gun that be not much different then the one you just have all the gun be basically the same you just have to find the one you like it will be your gun there be other gun like it but that one be yours i have a hour or 2 in this game so trust me you will have a great time,pos

225,i be surprised that i do not have a review write for poe i have 2300 hour play on the game let me preface this review by state that if you know anything about the arpg genre then you be probably already play this game but if you do not this review be for you with all my experience i hope i can help you make the decision if this be the right game for you so without further delay let jump right in the pro this game have a lot of content more than most free to play game i have play the developer actively and in a timely manner release new content item and game mechanic on a 2 3 month cycle they diligently pay attention to the continued existance of their game i respect them for that the game be hard especially for a new player don listen to people who write in their review that the game have lose all challenge these be usually people with thousand of hour play use the most expensive build in the game to trivialize content like those build be mean to in this experience you can really fine tune how challenge the game be if you be after that the game have a very deep level of customization for build you can pick it up and play it no matter what you build but do not expect your first build to carry you far this game be most of all a learning experience knowledge here really be power the visual design and music score be great they really work to bring the world to life there be plenty of lore hide in item description and place around the world you can also build your own hideout from different item that the master npc in the game offer if you be into that like me this game be truly free no content be hold behind a pay wall crazyi know but do not expect it to be give to you on a silver platter however no matter what you do every moment you sink into the game be worthwhile everything you pick up no matter how incrementally lead to you reach your goal that be something that i can not say for most the experience on the market the con the game be hard and unforgiving you will die to random thing while play and have to piece back together what you do wrong if you do not want to die again do not get discourage it happen to literally everyone trading be an essential skill you need to learn to get ahead in the game but the trading community be very toxic people try to make a profit constantly prey on new player so learn how to use poe trade and check it to make purchase and sale know what something be worth before you sell or buy the learning curve be steep but there be plenty of resource to prepare you for it you tube guide the game forum and the amazing wiki have everything you could ever need to get start do not ask people in game to explain a nebulous concept to you most of the game mechanic require several paragraph to explain use those other resource and feel free to ask specific question about what you want to know the gap between the rich player and the poor player be truly vast bridging it be impossible without a lot of effort you can not pay to win and if you do to one of the illegal bot expect to get ban the developer stay on top of that in my opinion this be the good arpg on the market and it keep evolve to stay that way i enjoy play and support a game make by people who convey a level of professionalism one expect from people run a business and not just work on their game hobby,pos

263,allow me to start this review by say that the game in it be basic free to play version be a decent one to say the least with a pretty nice community and enjoyable gameplay why then be i not recommene this game it be common knowledge that these type of game be lean more and more towards p2w but while other game may actually care about you if you spend money not this one not if use your steam wallet to buy the product at any rate i use my steam wallet to buy some currency call zen hope to sell it in game for quick astral diamond which be basically the common currency not only be i not reward the first time buyer pack which be reserve for people who buy directly from arc my account be put on probation mean anything i buy be bind to my account and i be unable to sell zen you would think a day or two while they verify the payment would be understandable but it have be a week and a half and i be still on probation i think fine let try something else so i buy enchanted key which let you open lockbox hope to find a decent item to sell in the auction house the key be also bind but what they fail to mention be even the reward in the lockbox will be bind so for example if you find a mount selling for around 6million astral diamond which you do not like or already have you be stick with it i can almost hear people say dum a of course the reward will be bind your key be also bind but you be wrong vip player and yes i be one get an enchant key everyday which be also bind however the reward open with it be not so to recap i do recommend this game in the free to play mode possibly get vip but do not bother use more money to be treat like a third grade citizen,neg

270,pro extremely detailed very relax the actual process be exhaustively accurate or at least aspire to be i do not own a gun myself that i can cross check their work with if a give part could not be remove in reality without remove another part the game make you do it in the correct order it also force you to deal with part so small that they do not initially seem to be there even on a close examination plastic mode color all the part differently in bright neon color to make them stand out more useful in these case a competitive element that you can engage or ignore freely each gun have leaderboard you can compare yourself against there be also car and skeleton to disassemble although only a handful of each and a motorcycle and two military vehicle the game include shooting range and challenge to allow you to play with the gun as well as just examine them but it appear that not all gun have corresponding range out of the five i have unlock only two have such level con you start with only three model ak 47 1911 and a human skeleton under bonus model to unlock more gun you have to either save up experience point or spend real world money if you be willing to spend money you unlock gun quite quickly to do it through xp you have to grind that be slow i be seven hour in and have unlock just three additional gun keep in mind that each gun i have encounter so far take no more than ten minute to completely disassemble and re assemble and that be the first time attack a relatively complex gun like the ak the tec 9 clocking in at less than forty part take just five minute total and judge by the leaderboard i be slow what be more gun unlock in a specific order along a tree like a civ v tech tree except that it go in multiple direction you have to unlock eight gun to get to the garand for instance and those eight gun take you in the opposite direction from the desert eagle for another example you can not actually see the whole tree to begin with either you see the next gun available to unlock and you can see vague outline of the one after that with no name or detail after that nothing you have to consult chart make by other player to plan your unlock more than two step ahead there be also a handful of gun that can be unlock only with purchase credit there be often gun beyond these that can only be access by get through that one gun so while they be free you can not get at them without have pay virtually all of the respectable handful of non gun model be pay credit only as well conclusion it be good for kill a few hour here or there but completionist should be aware that it be impossible to 100 percent this title without pay and everyone should be aware that what progress you can make be make only at a comparative crawl,pos

279,so let me start this off that i absolutely love this game but it have a lot of issue with it i will explain the pro and con and feature the game currently need below i have be play the game since 2013 and my hour be not correct as i have a pre steam version of the game and only recently switch to a steam version pro the tank combat be outstanding and imo it be far superior then world of tank in many way the selection of tank and airplane be vast and they be constantly add new one into the game currently add french airplane line arcade air combat be a lot of fun as it lift most of the restraint that you would not experience in realistic or simulator you can make turn that would normally rip your wing off the map and all the vehicle be absolutely stunning at max setting and i have no issue run it on either of my pc one have a single gtx 980 and my main pc have 3 980ti gaijin be constantly update the game and patching issue that be report and do rebalance of gameplay there be multiple game mode to choose from range from arcade to simulator and even have event tournament con though the tank airplane be fairly historical look the actual function of the vehicle be not german bf109 and fw focke wolf be absolutely nerfe beyond belief in realistic they do not turn whatso ever and be just shred 90 of the time by every nation now grant if you use stick and paddle you will be able to maneuver alot better and beat most with mouse and keyboard but if you run into someone else use same thing you stand no chance normally the german tank be know for their power at the time and that do do not show in the game many of the tank that germany use be powerful and heavily armoured but in war thunder it seem there be a bias by the developer about them german tank be very slow compare to most tank yes but they be hard to kill from the front and even from the side on some of them but in war thunder i have see tiger i destroy in single shot through the front by light tank there be also a huge issue with the fact that a panther and tiger be unable to penetrate the sloped front of the sherman which be only 2 inch thick and with angle only make it 3 6 inch thick yes the armor be good to stop a panzer 3 but it could easily be penetrate by tiger i and panther huge russian biased for all of their vehicle the tank seem to have twice the armour that be actually list and bounce so many shot its unbelievable i have a russian game where i bounce 13 shot in a row from 4 different tank at different angle and be able to take all 4 of them out without take any major damage the russian air force be vastly out match by the luftwaffe for nearly the entire war but in war thunder once again russian airplane crush every other nation airplane with ease people be able to turn the game setting to the low possible graphic that it give them an advantage over those who play be high detail at the low setting it remove bush at long distance and decrease the foliage on tree and even remove some boulder rock on the map this allow people to shoot from farther distance and be hide to those playing at a high detail and be a very cheap tactic that be be take advantage of for year now only recently have it become so bad that atleast 75 of the time you will be shoot from across the map without see the enemy i have even watch replay on map be people be shoot through the ground and hit people at the bottom of a hill the game have two different currency be silver lion and golden eagles silver lion be earn through get kill hit capture zone etc while golden eagles be buy with real money now yes the game be a free game and have to have some way of earn income the way it be in place in war thunder be fine 90 of the time until you figure out that it give some nation an unfair advantage and screw over other a good example be the russians get a be 6 in tier 4 to those who do not know there be 6 tier now you may think that be not a big issue but it be when you look at the tank it be face which be far inferior to an be 6 what make it bad be the fact that the be 3 be a tier 5 tank now historically the be 6 do be not well then a be 2 or be 3 and very few be 6 be make because of this but once again russian bias make this tank over power another good example be the only german tier 4 tank be the ru 251 can only be buy with golden eagles mean germany do not have a tier 4 light tank to use put it at a huge disadvantage another huge issue be uptiere everytime i play as a german in tier 3 with battle rate 5 7 in realistic i be instantly uptiered to battle rate 6 7 go up in a tier make a huge difference as you will go from fighting be 1s and t34 85 to be 6 be 2 etc which be hard for a tiger to take out due to the bias against german vehicle there be so much more i could go into about con that i be just go to end it where i be at just because i feel the con alone be enough of a sign that the game be break due to a bias against german vehicle and the fact that russian vehicle seem to be the great thing ever make this game brough me alot of fun when i first start play it but now day i get so angry due to be kill by people use low detail to have cheap kill or run into russian super vehicle if you do decide to get into the game i suggest if you be go to play tank to play simulator as it so far its the only game mode anymore worth play imo,neg

284,good game if you like create with box there be some combat involve but depend the setting of the world you be in it can be minimal and easy which be not necessarily a bad thing you can easily play this without spend any real money but if you like it i imagine you will probably get to the point where you want to spend a little it be well to do that early in your experience with this game since you will get more for your money early on even if you wait or never spend any of your hard earn fund this be still a good game for its genre and worth play,pos

287,early access reviewim conflict i love and hate this game at the same time i have play this game at least double the registered steam time since i have mostyl play it on my moble everything about this game be good like really good except for 1 thing the power mana system be this game big flaw it feal like the dev dident want to risk any new change in this area so they take a safe bet and copy the mana system from magic the gathering flat of alos inherit its flaw there be mecanic they have introduce from time to time in order to mitigate this problem but in the end you can not remove the risk only reduce the risk if you as a player can forgive the high impack that the randomness of your power have on every game you play then i can highly recommend this game flaw explain you be go to lose game that you could not impact in any way due to the randomness of the power system this hurt extra much if you hade to pay in game currency to enter forge or draft mode no matter how much time you tweak and tinker your deck to perfection there be still a change that you be power starved example 1there be a risk of get stick on 2 power even if your deck be 1 colored and all your card cost 3 you can still lose the game due to not draw a powercard in 10 consecutive turn example 2 you have a multi colored deck of 2 color let say green and blue then the problem will be influence relate which type of fraction you can spend you power on there be a risk that you only draw green card and only get blue influence the entire game even if you have take extreme measure with the deck building to counter this problem here be just me cye a little etra to get it out of my head sorry me personally can have 4 card out of 75 that cost 8 mana and all other card cost 3 i will still dra all 4 of the 8 cost card as initial hand every game all the time,pos
288,really fun the first time through buuuuuuut if you decide to make another character and go through with a different class the game get really long and bore it can get really expensive at time too since get a good mount 110 move speed can cost like 30 40 can also be very repetetive and grindy at time since most of the mission be the kill x amount of these thing type of mission pvp can be a completeshow since most of the time you will go against people with like 3 billion gear score and they will fuuuuuuuckkkkkk you up those be all the big con of the game and i be to lazy to list the pro so yeahhhh its really up to you if you want to get this game or not but if those con make u wanna kill yourself then you probably should not get this game,neg
289,i never write review and i never pay more than a couple buck for a game but this one deserve it addicting like minecraft it be minecraft but it run much well on my old computer and have a lot of feature i want in minecraft only down side be that it be not open source like minecraft so if you want mod and other item you have to purchase dlc but still fun regardless i hope the developer continue to refine the game feature and add more one thing i would really want be an offline mode,pos
290,not too happy with this game after play the include campaign basically everything cost gold or cash farming gold be kinda slow you need 3 4 daily mission for 1 event ticket and to unlock another campaign or state of the art deck you will need about 20 40 daily there be resource to improve card that be quite grindy to get in addition even if you have all the stuff to improve card you may notice that your level be too low for that and you will have to grind some more the ai deck look pretty rigged to me and the campaign often give advantage to the opponent it suffer from all tcg prob like get wrong card at the wrong time while opponent seem to get just what they need to compensate the ai seem to play bad when you retry a campaign mission so even the dumb will make it at some point so he can purchase the next campaign card pack 6 card cost 2 buck and more often than not contain crap card or card for different school you can not use with your main deck event ticket be 2 buck each and you can fight up to 9 ai opponent for reward but without some special card you will start to loose after 3 5 enemy make this a bit cheap than buy pack but still expensive not a bad game if you want to spend some buck or invest serious time to unlock thing but for casual play it be just to grindy and boring do not dare to start pvp fight and bail out after i finish the include campaign and reach level 9,neg

321,for a free game world of tank be a lot of fun no transaction be really required and there be not a paywall to prevent those who do not pay anything from be competitive occasionally competition can be annoying when your team do not really care or one of the player on your team go mia on you there be also a lot of grinding after a certain tier which can be frustrating when you have have a long lose streak if you do not like ginde by yourself the good way to play this game be to drag in a few friend with you the moment i start learn from my mistake and start grind with friend my gameplay get a lot better and i start enjoy myself more great game for its price,pos

323,i be initally draw to the retro style aesthetic and comedic discworld esque world building element of this pseudo 8 bit mmo however the sheer intensity of the combat be honestly too much for my sensibility but hey if you like the idea of experience a fantasy theme bullet hell or perhaps magic missile hell would be more apt term then jump right in the control be straighforward enough even for a dexterously challenge player like myself but the pure volume of stuff that be out to kill you make this an ideal experience for more competetive type,pos

343,early access reviewthe maker do a very solid job import a successful template into a 3d space battle evironment find a good server to enter before it fill up be the tricky part right now i be also get the impression that in some situation when a game just end you can get stick in the connection screen think i have not really verify once you be in the game the performance be solid i have not really encounter the memory bleed issue that other people have talk about even at this stage i can see a ton of potential down the road it be in prelaunch so realize that 1 there be not as much content as a finished game so battle do get old when you play several game in a row 2 you will be ask a lot of what do this ability do again this game be in pre launch 3 you will ask question in chat and most people have be helpful the environment be not at least not yet as toxic as some other similar game,pos
344,early access reviewthis game be super fun easy to learn and easy to get into there be in game purchase but the rate you earn card just by play be great you can build a good competitive deck after play through the tutorial quest and do some draft if you enjoy magic hearthstone or any card game be sure to give this one a shot it be free what do you have to lose,pos

350,so i agree with some other that the game can become a little repetitive over time and if you do not like grind or spend a lot a lot of time mining then maybe do not play this but overall it be free to play and they be update with new content still and as far as i understand will continue to do so it be a great and pretty alternative to minecraft and there be some really fun stuff to play and do in the game good for multiplayer as well if you want to build together and create your own place,pos

368,just go to start with say that this be my personal opinion and my experience with the game other will have different experience and opinion of their own i play this game quite a lot when it first come out year ago before steam i buy the god bundle because i like be able to play all the different mythological figure i enjoy different take on a moba style game and love the mythology angle of it unfortunately the longer the game be out the less fun it become it reach esports level and people start dump their life into the game i play mobas very casually and do not take them very seriously at this point the game be almost unplayable in a casual way bot match be a terrible waste of time unless you just want to try out a new god you have never play before the bot be so bad at the game that it do not even give you a good feel of how the god actually play though outside of bot match the majority of the game i join i end up against a clan that clearly play the game a lot while i end up on a team of random with no coordination what so ever the other team will just steam roll through yours and not even be take the game seriously it be not really an enjoybale game when 5 minute into the game your team have 1 2 kill while they be in the double digit they destroy half your tower and be now just farm kill for fun you can not surrender until 10 minute and they be fully aware of that once in a very rare while you will get into a normal game without any clan and it can be pretty enjoyable but those match be far and few between the only way to really enjoy the game be to play it seriously and focus on it as your go to game you pretty much have to find a group of people to play the game with and really only play it with them of course there be go to be player that be good enough to carry a team but for most game it be go to be a matter of the group coordination planning and communication like any moba the real issue i have with the game be that casual play do not exist because their either be not a skill base matchmaking system or it be just a really horrible one i will maybe play this game once a month to try out new god release or try out a new event but it get bad every time i come back i do not know why they think it make sense to put clan up against completely random group in their non ranked play there be plenty of clan in queue why can not they get match together and random group can get match with random group and of course like most mobas the community be pretty toxic you can expect to be insult and trash talk by the clan that just wipe the floor with your team at the end of the match because it be too ez for them i can jump back into hot or lol queue up and typically get into a game with people of similar skill and at least have a chance at win most game i do not have time to focus all my attention of this game and follow the meta to have the perfect build with the right team to run the perfect play against another team on a regular basis if there be a way to conitently queue up and not end up against an organized clan i would probably play this game more and actually be able to enjoy it again tl dr do not bother with this game unless you like incredibly stupid bot match or get steamroll by clan in unranked casual queue if you love mobas and you have an organize well communicate group to go into battle with you then my review do not really apply and you should give it a try if you be look to play it casually then you really should pass on the game,neg

387,early access reviewthis game confuse me because it be not badly do it be a f2p game but it be mostly pay2avoidgrind there be some p2w element to it but i have not notice them have any significant impact on the game you gain the free currency fast and unlock the gear quickly i be in a tank with a big gun on it by my second night of play the interesting part be that the starter tank with a machine gun be not actually bad infact it be pretty good you be essentially a metal box of anti infantry that can park in any barn you want it work well and you do not feel crap on from above just because you be not shell out money on unlock upgrade quicker with real cash the weapon be heavily customisable and they actually make a difference i have an smg that fire so fast that at least one person have accuse me of hacking because of it wonderful thing since i be such a crap shot you can also steal bicycle and give people backie which be clearly a major selling point the game itself be very basic there be not much to it it be a ww2 shooter which feel to me like day of defeat on battlefield sized map but it be nothing special just a shooter but it have me hook i have no idea why the game be average but the fact that it be a f2p game that do not feel like i be force to pay up to keep up have me smirk as i sit in my little tank gun down anyone that come near the cap point i could use a big tank sure you gain currency just as quickly as you gain unlock but i do not want to because everything in this game from basic gear to big gear have it be place i be still confused as to exactly what it be about this game i like maybe it be just simply because it be hit all the right note for a f2p game that want to include a p2w element but do not feel like a monster grind or keep me down because of it maybe it be because the game be barebones but feel like it have a lot of content to it and will only have more on the way or maybe it be just because i can steal some americans bicycle for the glorious fatherland,pos
388,model f2p the big downside to the game be its zen system which i suppose be the only way for a free mmo to make money as one would expect from a f2p model unlike in game like path of exile the item purchase with zen can definitely be game altering and offer advantage that free player would not have access to at a much early level however there be a way to convert in game currency astral diamond into zen at a conversion rate that change depend on the market neverwinter sometimes push the player to use special currency in order to open lockbox contain level appropriate equipment but be otherwise not too intrusive unfortunately the in game currency of zen to dollar ratio use an extremely expensive conversion when compare to other f2p game such as rift while most decent item set cost somewhere between 1500 3000 zen approximately 500 zen 5 depend on how many zen be purchase at once gameplay some of the most innovative and fun combat you will find in the current mmo scene the class be very well flesh out but definitely not balance as of yet most class require re position timing and anticipation when react to enemy or even ally action it be definitely not a click and spam blindly game unique mechanic be introduce depend on the class a guardian fighter can hold up a shield to block attack while a rogue can quickly close distance with a teleporting strike every class feel truly unique and full of flavor the combat system be mostly base on a d d type of ruleset with skilltree in the form of feat and eventual specialization while quest be very linear and everything else be pretty much what you would expect in a standard mmo the profession system be more of a que and wait overall i would recommend this game to anyone who be await wildstar and its combat system and want something similar to satisfy their hunger for arpg type combat additionally creative mind can use this game to create scenario type quest and dungeon through a feature i personally have not use much call the foundry multiplayer standard faire for the current mmo market pvp scenario of vary type pit 5v5 co op challenge that can quickly be complete with friend or random player and dungeon lot of variety for all type of player and a guild system most player use the in game chat to find group or member no innovation but definitely satisfy for those who do not like solo 7 5 10,pos

391,early access reviewignore my hour on steam for this game i have be play realm royale ever since it get into close alpha and i can tell you that this be a fresh breath of air in the oversaturated genre that be battle royale one of the big thing that i applaud realm royale for be its encouragement of more aggressive and meaningful playstyle rather than the camping of pubg and the turtling building of fortnite this be mainly due to realm royale class system you can choose from 5 different class the warrior a tanky bruiser class that be focus on close range fighting and enemy engagement with melee and shotgun the engineer a more supportive class that can build turret and focus mainly on area denial and heal the assassin a high damage class that use deception and invisibility to dish out high amount of damage from either far away or right behind you the mage my personal favorite a class focus on use their ability to impede their enemy progress or to help themselves survive the hunter a class focus on dish out consistent damage while also keep their distance from their enemiesunlike other battle royale there be a class and playstyle for everyone and the variety of playstyle that each class have make fight between them unique and appeal rather than the dull camping of other popular battle royale the gameplay rely heavily on player skill and knowledge of what a class be capable of do the game craft system also counterract the great issue of battle royale games rng instead of have to pray for a good loot drop in crate the game allow you to craft your own legendary item and potion if you have the resource necessary to do so the ability to also call for a mount for quick traversal of the map be also a welcome addition and help to speed up the game significantly the map itself be also visually appealing and provide different biome each with their own flair and touch now while there be so many positive to this game there be also a few negative for one the game be still in alpha so there be some bug that you can expect to find in the game hi rez be do a great job of fix these bug but there be still some bug in the game so be warn the amount of item and ability that you can get in the game be also limited and certain spell and weapon be lock behind class which be to be expect overall though these negative be mainly due to the fact that this game be still in its alpha stage when its fully polished i expect that this game could very easily beat the like of pubg and fortnite due to its fun and refreshing gameplay that be not halt to a screech due to overly defensive gameplay or cut and dry mechanic,pos

452,hi again everyone happy steam sale it be time for another review war thunder be another entry in the ww2 battlefest category and it be a vehicular version of fps gameplay feature player operable plane and some tank that be sure to satisfy some fan of the genre i have not have the opportunity to sample everything the game have to offer but i have sample it enough to give a good basic review and endorsement base upon the fun hour i have spend in the game so what be the particular pick a major player from ww2 axis or ally grab a plane and fight or alternatively grab either a russian or german armored ground unit and go to work at the present it appear that ground and air game be completely separate with the alternate form of fighting handle by ai in either game you get some very basic gear to start off with at tier 1 and work your way up the ladder your achievement in game translate into research point for upgrade as you go your upgrade increase your ability to survive and achieve more as you play you easily earn enough unless thing change to purchase well plane and gear without spend real cash there be an arcade mode a realistic mode and a simulator mode i have spend nearly all of my time in arcade and that be plenty of fun i will leave the review of realistic and sim mode to someone with much more experience with those therefore please assume my comment be mostly base upon my experience with arcade the good a lot there be a lot to like about this game even if it be a bit f2p mmo ey for some what it do right be astoundingly good i think it be beautiful play on three monitor surround if you can add joystick and throttle if you like gamepad anyone or just wing it with a single monitor and mouse the developer aim to give you many option with this one and it fulfill many of my gaming sim desire involve plane ww2 and lovely landscape there be an arcade mode a realistic mode and a simulator mode i have play many game that attempt to straddle the line between simulator and arcade game and as a result i have log numerous hour attempt to keep my plane under control while try to find and engage a distant speck in the sky in war thunders arcade mode you get some level of realism mix with ton of action action action freedom of choice and strong competition make this game a winner with a large selection of aircraft most of which you must earn or into which you may pay your way a vibrant at this time player community on pc and ps4 make wait time for battle very low the matchmaking be somewhat good because you get place into a group base upon your skill and gear the pay 2 win aspect be somewhat mitigate by this because while you can pay your way ahead you can only pay your way so far beyond your peer before you place yourself in a completely different rank of competition skill and brain be requrie regardless of your gear and this be a good thing because iron sharpen iron as they say the bad i find there be a serious lack of balance in the game not everyone will agree of course but if you play the start plane of all nation you can feel the difference some will argue that this reflect the reality of vary level of tech at the start of the war but i disagree the soviet aircraft and tank always feel op both on the giving and on the receiving end i can not tell you how many aircraft i have be shoot down in by player in soviet plane i once fly a large bomber which have its tail sever with one blow from a soviet biplane rocket maybe one shot lucky hmmm i be not sure i have have wing cut off by soviet fighter like they be make of brittle paper in this game for maneuverability it be hard to beat the soviet biplane for sheer 55kickery it be hard to beat their fighter which appear to destroy anything that get too close to their sight in tank game which only allow german and russian vehicle at this time the russian tank feel somehow tough to me the tank gun sight turn color depend on how likely your round be to pierce enemy armor at the point of aim green for good chance of damage yellow for middling and red for low chance at damage compare tank for tank i have have trouble damage opponent while use german tank and a green crosshair while at the same time destroy opponent in one shot use a russian tank with a red crosshair if you fly british or japanese begin fighter and the russian begin fighter on the same day for the first time after you be experience with the mechanic of the game just as i do before write this review you can feel the difference in the aircraft for each nation the russian aircraft feel well be more maneuverable and i score more hit kill and assist with those than i do with any other nation aircraft at that time for that level crew be completely new and all other element somewhat equal gaijin be russian i suppose that say all that need to be say and i have have issue with gaijin over their moderation in other game in the past take it for what it be worth it be one informed opinion you be entitled to your own which i hope you will develop on your own by play this game regardless some may claim that the russian aircraft be just that good but i offer you this quote from wikipedia by 1938 the soviet union have the large air force in the world but soviet aeronautical design be distinctly lag behind western technological advance instead of focus on develop tactical aircraft the soviets engineer develop heavy bomber plane only good for long distancein other word plane that would be use for record break flight like those of chkalovs the soviet government focus on showy stunt and phenomenal record breaking mission drain resource need for soviet defense when nazi germany attack the soviet union in june1941 it quickly become apparent that the soviet air force be not prepare for war june 20 2014 the ugly i only have two complaint and then i will move on first do not make any statement in chat that anyone may find remotely disagreeable because the community have a good number of loudmouth jerk troll even if you say nothing chance be good that you will read something hilariously asinine while play if you play for a bit a few idiot like to tk and in that respect it be no different from any fps second you be go to get botte just accept that fact quietly and move on when it happen try to open the scoreboard click the name of the person who do it and report them for botte it be make inconvenient on purpose so few people will file complaint especially false one in my experience if you say anything about it in chat you will catch flak from some jerk seriously if someone get lucky that be not an issue for me if someone be shoot at me for any length of time and they hit my pilot that in general be fine but here my experience of what be happen for your consideration scenario 1 i be fly along i hear br less than a second of gun sound and my pilot be knock unconscious on replay i watch a guy fly into position shoot a couple of round if that and fly away immediately after all of that add up to bot in my mind scenario 2 i be fly along in a bomber same thing happen one guy simply turn off my engine just that fast without any apparent damage otherwise most often however my pilot be just knock out my thing be this if they shoot me through my plane would not the round have hit something on the way in thus do damage to the plane as well as knock my pilot unconscious a few scenario present themselves say that it could happen otherwise but i find it happen all too often,pos
453,good gameplay idea inexplicable business model i understand the need to make money but the free to play pay to win experience base model just do not mesh with the game itself it make far more sense as a nice relaxing sim than anything that pretend to be competitive i do not want to compete or level up or connect to a server i just want to disassemble some gun to be fair it do a good job of that as far as i can tell but i do not want to mess around level up and try to gain achievement to unlock more gun drop the price and give us a sandbox mode,neg

459,early access reviewfrom what i have play while not a heap i can definatly say that yes it be in development but even so still provide a challenging gameplay mechanic that be not really see in game these day control these massive ship be difficult and yet somehow simple while use the weapon be a breeze and take influence from third person shooter aim then click and on top of manage everything make a stratagy to win the match i would really like to see this game flesh out more in the future which i be sure be come but for now the gameplay be solid with a surprisingly good tutorial and the o k system be awesome i would like to see the control page be dynamic with change in your keybind but that s just me and the menu be well lay out and present neatly and for an early access game that s all you need server be alright i would like to see more reigon in the server list but i be australian so apparently i do not matter xdgraphic be good but sometimes lock up in highly demanding moment like their hyper jump or what ever they be call it basically a great space opera with pretty good gameplay and decent yet to improve graphic tldr its really good you should buy it its like star citizen but real,pos

478,be play this game a number of year so i speak with experience of yesterday and today prior to this review i check the number of positive review just over 50k and the number of negative just over 39k i find myself in the middle but for the purpose of steam i have tick no first of all please ignore the image on show i do not think any player get graphic like that i have a pretty top rig with decent fps and graphic on high and its nothing like the image above clearly they have have the kim kardashian effect of have be gloss the only good thing about this game be that its a game that still have a lot of potential yet the potential be never really realise the dev make far to many judgement error when develop this game and i will list a number of them below as a free game i do appreciate that development must be slow due to revenue stream be tight but still i expect a certain bare minimal to let that stand but now thing be really sloppy 1 give the people community what they wantdid you know that lmgs do not have bipod yep that right all those movie and documentary you have see be the germans mount mgs on the ground or on concrete sandbag bunker be all fake well accord to h gs there be even though they be draw on the weapon you can not use them virtually every ww2 game i have ever play apart from the very early medal of honor and call of duty game from the early 2000 have deployable bipod i think day of defeat may have be the first and that be a mod for the original half life which give you some idea of how long they have be use on forum all i see be give me bipod give me certain plane and yet the dev say not currently plan when cod ww2 come out all mgs be mountable so how come the dev of cod include it even though mgs do not really play a huge part be as mgs in h gs do make no sense and especially hafter 3 4 year of ask too 2 dev do not know their history sometimes there be a wide variety of weapon and vehicle in this game and for the most part they actually do look great but one of the most laughable thing be when they introduce plane that never even feature in ww2 on the general map you can attack switzerland hang on be they not nutural in ww2 russia can attack usa and vice versa could have swear they be ally 3 a cheater hacker paradisei never quite understand the need to hack cheat use macros etc in mmos because ultimately it can kill of the the genuine player base in spite of the dev good effort this game be a hack fest and it have become quiet the joke especially when you see some of the video on youtube recently i get headshot snipe by a pistol the other player be on the other side of the map this after the introduction of a major update which include new anti hack software but like anything go for the low bidder and you will get what you have pay for 4 very angry player basecompare to a few year ago abuse have become aweful and this have nothing to do with bad player although it be the individual player commit the abuse its the way the dev have allow player to play there be really no way to learn this game any more except the hard way compare to year ago when there be a basic training map and a basic skirmish map now any player of any rank and experience can play any map and in a lot case that s not fair for the new player and also not fair for the experienced player in the basic map that be suppose to be design for novice player its far too common now to come across player with high end gear flip the coin and you have similar issue play a general war game and find yourself under the command of a player who be lvl 4 and your lvl 15 it simply make no sense with this in mind you see a lot of abuse in game due to player with a lack of experience not play as a team a simple solution would be to add restriction to the game play option i still have hope for this game and always like to return every now and then to see where the game be but its painful sometimes to see its current state,neg

493,alright so i have play a little bit of this game and what i find most about it be that it be repetitive very repetetive will i keep play probably but i can not give this game a good review as much as i be sure all of you would like this to be a good review now when i say it be repetitive i mean that the storyline be practically the same for all character i will admit the gameplay be slightly different for some character and the job change offer a small bit of interest for all of five minute but overall the gameplay become repetitive the quest be just meh and quite frankly the pay to have op stuff tactic ispoor design tldr the gameplay be repetitive the quest be repetitive the character do not feel different enough and do not get me start on the in game real money shop i appreciate that the dev put a lot of time into this but quite frankly i do not care for it this game rate at 3 2 10 from me and even that i feel be too generous,neg
494,what could have possibly be the great online game of the decade be be actively ruin by a company that both have no idea what they be do and do not give aanymore i want to recommend this game to you it be one of my all time favorite i have meet countless friend and compete in smite have genuinely make me develop as a person and shape me into who i be today the game at its core be unbelievably fun but hirez do not ing care and so neither should you do not waste your time i be so e upset man,neg
495,simply put i do not have such love hate relationship with any other game than i have with war thunder also no other game have make me more salty than war thunder that say i will list some pro and con pro different level of realism from shooty tooty arcade to much slower pace simulator battle lot of tank and airplane to unlock and new one be constantly add very nice graphic free to play but not win to pay do actually require some skill especially later in gamecon realism be sometimes more like realism tank ricochet round in very weird way or take damage when they really should not etc there be lot of stuff to unlock but sometimes you will notice that vehicle be very similiar for example when unlock american tank you will spend age grind through three different shermans that be not actually that different from each other after all slight change to armour thickness etc do not really mean anything and that be just one example technically it be still pay to win war thunder have this premium system that give you different kind of booster to use and also provide you with a selection of premium vehicle not all of them be that special but some of them be seriously unbalanced and overpowered do require skill but still most of the time it seem that it be not enough game suffer from serious balancing problem and therefore some match end in minute no matter how good of an player you be some other thing that need to be note game have this battle rating system or br in short this mean that every vehicle have a rating for example 3 7 game then search for player with same br thing be that usually you have more than just one vehicle let say you have three tank with br of 3 7 thing be good and you be have pretty evenly balanced game then you get a tank with br of 4 3 suddenly you be face tank that have br of 5 or even higher this lead to greatly unbalanced game also because of this game do not always feel rewarding for example i grind for some time to get legendary tiger and panther tank but after i get them i really do not feel like play with them because i be fight more advanced prototype or post ww2 era tank most of the time that also take away some realism spawncampe yes i do it sometimes myself too but still too often i see game where one team steamroll to other team spawn and kill everyone some map even make it very easy by have the spawn point on open ground and easily see from across the map already unbalnace game become even more unbalnced because of this lack of teamwork it be extremely rare to see some real teamwork in wt unless you be play with friend or be part of some clan there be lot of russian player even on eu server and they do not usually speak english and even less usually they give a about other player not say that they all be like that just like 80 of them game mode do not really force you to be a team player okay maybe it be bit wrong to rant about this but i still want to point it out with tank game mode usually require player to capture and hold some point on the map even though you do get a reward for capture a point and you do get more point and currency if you win a match it do not force you to play the objective or be a team player wt would be a lot more fun with new game mode etc maybe there will be some in the future all in all war thunder be somewhat hook even though sometimes it make you really salty you may like it or not or perhaps you will be like me and feel both way i choose not to recommend this game because right now it feel unbalanced and break maybe i will change my mind after a while or maybe not,neg

540,this be a game that over reach on just about every aspect and then fall flat on its face recently i be persuade to install this game and play online with my son however during the two and a half hour stream throughout the game despite the fact that i do enjoy play with my son i voice just how disappointed i be with this game from the narrative to the gameplay to the visual it look more like a poor mans dayz which be say a lot as that game by itself be very poorly optimize but be still an awesome game narrative what narrative i have come across some very basic game in the past and each and every single one of them have some form of narrative even if it be just an explanation of the game this one have nothing the game be base on a post apocalyptic world that be now overrun by zombie that be about as far as the narrative go yet as you will read on the game have a lot of potential but because of the lack of attention to detail well if the narrative be anything to go by do not expect much else visual the game as a whole have some element that you can see in other game most notably the arma dayz game the problem be you get the distinct impression that the development team just do not give aone of the big problem i have with the visual be the draw distance some of you may know the spec of my streaming gaming pc that i use as i regularly stream other game at maximum graphical setting so you get the good stream possible to watch despite the fact my pc be more than capable this game be just terribly optimise the draw distance in this game be ridiculous you get the high quality texture for about 10 foot in front of your character then you get the low quality texture after that and combine with the poor texture optimisation that same 10 foot be where you get all the game asset in visual range anything beyond this some of the asset simply disappear this problem can be see on any map in any server at any time another issue be the poor quality of the well quality texture and the model use in the game the building for the most part can not be enter which be unusual for a game that be base on survival instead we get a box with a texture for the building you can enter they be very empty with no furniture chair kitchen not even rubbish just the odd pick up every now and then the model and animation use for the zombie and even your character be very sub par the zombie animation look more comical than scary as they tend to bounce towards you with both hand in the air your character model be also something not to be admire in first person mode the hand some time do not match up with the weapon you be hold certain wearable item you can collect be laughable as depend on what character you have select create there hair jacket will show through the item you pick up another part thatme off be the map themselves as there be very little attention to detail put into the map the more prominent problem be the amount of asset that be leave suspend in mid air grass rock some tree vehicle and i even see a building or two that be above the ground you get the distinct impression that the developer take no pride in create the game as a whole and rush it overall it look like it be create with an old unity game engine use stock asset with such obvious laziness in the visual side of the game it be hard to find anything good to say about it if it be design use an old game engine there be no excuse for the ingvisual you have to take into consideration that this game be less than 2 year old and look as though some dude in his mom basement make this game in his spare time but i suspect there be more to this and that be reveal in the gameplay gameplay poor when you first start the game there be a basic character creation tool that be very limited in option and that be for a very good reason if you want something different you have to pay yes the game game have micro transaction and be completely litter with them yes it be a free game to play but if you want to win you have to pay so not only be it full of unnecessary micro transaction it be a pay to win system which put it in the same category ofgame along with battlefront ii when you play the survivor mode you select create your character and when you join a server you have to go around and hunt for pickup from a large backpack that can hold more item to armour weapon food drink bandage among other useless item that have no bearing on the game so not bad but when you take into account that other people have simply pay for a backpack sniper armour and other stuff before they even enter the map it take the fun out of it instantly as it be no longer an even playing field what be bad be the fact that when you die instead of re spawn back on the same map you be kick out of the server and take back to the lobby and guess what your character can not be revive for about 10 minute force you to create another character and this be directly link to the micro transaction side as those that do spend when they inevitably get kill they can not take all them item for that character and transfer them onto the other so if you do want that awesome sniper armour or backpack before you jump back into the game you will have to buy them all over again be you see a pattern yet when you be in game it be e annoying as hell with the server be very light on population and the map be as big as they be you can run for an hour and not meet or see anyone the same can be say about item for you to pick up and those that have pay for weapon in advance will simply sit there and snipe you before you even pick up a thing after an hour of roam around as i say early pay to win the size of the map be of course one problem but another be the vehicle yes they can make roam around faster but when a troop transporter tank can get hang up on a chain link fence or be knock back by a zombie it be ultimately a waste of an asset that do not work as it should something that be very laughable be the hit box on the zombie themselves you can shoot next to there head and it will register as a head shoot yet sometimes if you shoot them dead in the chest it will not register a hit at all and this i do not understand in the slight i come across a sort of super zombie that be double the size of all the other npc faster than you and apparently unkillable i stand on top of a tank where it could not hit me and i empty all my ammo into its head and it would not die i do not see the point of it and it take all what be leave of the fun this game have if any and pour it down the drain it stop the game dead for me and i be leave expose unable to move or do anything without be kill and have to start all over again conclusion the game look as though it be rush with the bad possible game engine but cram full of micro transaction to cash in on the zombie craze that be come back and the battle royal craze that have hit many other game it be a game design for one reason and one reason only get rich quick it be a game that be disappointing in every single aspect and there be not one redeemable point you can take away from the game that make it seem lessthan what it be 1 10just do not wast your time look for it let alone download it from the steam store you will be sorely disappointed with it just take a look at how inactive there server be,neg
541,early access reviewcomplete joke of a game use to be fun then the update arrive that add crate instead of a steady progression system now those that manage to get to max level before the switch have all the high level epic rate item that hardly ever drop in crate and the matchmaking be even more ed as there be no challenge system stop high level player from stomp newbie terrible game atrocious balance and poor choice by dev maybe if they fix the matchmaking and do not push the pay 2 win t i will be back but it be unlikely consider there be much better similar game out already do not get me wrong it be an alright game with a nice building combat system and i enjoy many hour of play with it but since this update i have uninstalle it and never look back a damn shame it be just turn into another p2w toilet box,neg

545,game be very clearly pay to win while indeed all non cosmetic can be obtain freely the gain for its currency be a single weapon once every twelve hour of play if you maintain the same pace of the number 1 stat earning player in the game this do not include the price you have to pay for class and vehicle to make them competitive all of which be two to three time more expensive pay player get significant resource advantage that allow them to pull vehicle much more often player be occasionally suspend for achieve score that get deem too high by an automate system all while legitimate hacker take day to week to ban due to a worthless reporting system that need to be circumvent by on website support ticket and reddit thread mandatory item for some class be lock behind very expensive loot box and a tedious alert system that require your faction to win repeatedly to level up which perhaps maybe 10 20 player on a give server have any real impact on which faction actually win failure to have say item can mean the difference between a 1 2 kd and a 6 0 kdthe hit detection in the game be client base so a particularly laggy individual have an extreme advantage if they play aggressively often get second of time before you can even see them to shoot at you individual that use way to artifically limit their ping or even just pull the plug on their connection can increase that time to almost half a minute before server will bother automatically log them off the development team actively desparage critizism of balance change unless it be overwhelmingly positive and have be catch on live stream suspend player for kill them while they casually play the game litterally the only thing that i can see that keep this game afloat be that there be no other true mmo fps on the market,neg

realm that you have be spawn into you survey the beach like enviroment be attack by your first few encounter as a wizard you strike back perhaps even spellbomb complete your first quest then adventure on inland the quest for level 20 begin which may take some time it probably will not be long until the death screen greet you be kill by say reason then one be probably grip onto the fully realise experience of perma death within the game and perhaps either hook to the progression that one can achieve or straight out quit only to perhaps return later at another date it be this continous cycle of life and death that cause the game to be extremely replayable to the point of stagnation for some gameplay be fairly straight forward core control be wasd key for movement spacebar for ability and right click to shoot a simple glance at the setting can further tweak these control as well as realise other crucial binding like the nexus key a key to return yourself to safety from critical moment like the nature of most bullt hell shooter dodge be see crucial as to keep your hp bar healthy have it drop below 0 would equate to the death of that character no respawn of that now deceased character of course your character can shoot back projectile towards specified enemy include melee character relative to actually range character make new entry player have to worry not of control but fixate on the more interesting aspect of the game itself the active gameplay and dance around projectile class fit the usual archetype from mmorpgs such as tank healer and damage dealer they can be sperate into weapon class then further into unique ability which bring about a unique style of combat to each character each have their own strength and weakness feature 8 stat value that can be upgrade to a max value that be different for each character class x 8 maxe be one of the game objective cause your character to become strong 8 8 at first be unmaxed can be consider play legendary to

reward those who continue to stay and overcome the challenge and obstacle of the game upon reach level 20 fame collecting become another game objective attempt to pin the tale of that character onto the competitive leaderboard a numerical value to illustrate the lifespan of your character it derive from complete quest achievement and just play the game the game feature peer to peer trade the many dungeoun that drop from certain creature realm event that spawn in order to allow the encounter of face the iconic face of the game these method allow for progression in term of gear as well as stat increase potion which also lead to be use as trading currency apart from untiered gear which be soulbound and so can not be trade base on supply and demand this style of currency make the game fairly integrate into loot grinding of valuable item that other player may want to trade for microtransaction be evident only serve as a method to perhaps skip through the farming part of rotmg only to bring dissatisfaction in addition to the risk of perma death fortunately these be not completely force upon gameplay wise only advertise skill be see more of a determine factor in the game only really restriction be perhaps have limited character and vault storage slot for the non buyer for those who seek for a story drive game rotmg will feel lack its loosely overlapping story be somewhat for the interpretation of the player it will be the gameplay which entice the player the focus on action with unique encounter require player to figure out and pattern recognise the many attack phase of the encounter conquer such will yield respectable reward the style of realm be blocky and cool and should appeal to those who love the retro theme world be split into numerous realm all connect to a nexus point these realm could house up to 85 player with no requiriment of set up need party although guild do exist experience be grant to all nearby player quality loot be soulbound when it do drop only see by player player be generally grind for their own gain of wealth of some sort but naturally player work together to take down tough quest realm present different region that represent level of difficulty head inland to godland be the most dangerous this co operative nature of the game allow for each and every chacter to shine contribute to the main group allow for synergy even the rogue class its ability to rush through dungeoun to the boss can be invaluable to the group the game can be frustrating annoying and depressing after each and every death especially after x amount of time invest into a character yet dance in the realm of the mad god can be fun just the nature and intense gameplay dynamic of have to constantly dodge and shoot that sense of exhilarating action pack into several pixel lootbag of dropping of various quality to provide that incentive to continue for more co operate with other player without the hassle of set up party through each death take each and every bit of experience to the next reborn character only to perhaps beat the record of your previous attempt i can recall several early positive memory be naive to the gameplay especially at the start where the game world would be so vast but commit time to understand it have friend to tag along with can make the journey incredibly endure the journey grind to the end goal of the game could be say the good part of the game experience as the close to end game the less fun it can be have already experience everything already by then regardless i have to sometimes ask myself how death could be so gripping,pos
577,i could recommend this game but have fun deal with 10 13 year old spamme the red baloon and spamme the emoticon it be very annoying and very but i would rate it 10 10,pos
578,early access reviewto be quite honest this game be far from perfect there be a measurable grind and the inability to solo certain area leave at time a sour taste in my mouth the fps can get choppy sometimes hitboxe need adjust and pc need it own ui however i absolutely love it a game like this be in constant development it be never intend to be complete on launch and never will be complete so long as an interested playerbase support and inspire artix co to contine work on it adventurequest 3d be only go to evolve and get well,pos

583,school of dragon be a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game set in the universe of the 2010 critically acclaimed dreamworks animation film how to train your dragon and its sequel step into the life of a viking dragon rider and journey beyond the isle of berk to the mainland continent and the surround island home to dozen of exotic dragon train your dragon from birth join clan and unite with your fellow dragon trainer ride on the back of these majestic winged beast and relive the thrill of how to train your dragon in stunning graphical detail free to play be what i would say if i be pay to promote this very bad game,neg
584,this be by far one of the good virtual hunting game ever make the graphic be amaze the animal realistic and the game be full of a wide variety of gun the negative review simply come from the fact that you have to spend real money on the gun and the fact its a pay to play not free as its advertise if you have the money you will not be disapointed if you do not well get a well job so you can enjoy it lol edit additionally you actually do not have to spend real money on in game item assume that you can get 1st to 3rd place on a hunting competion which reward you with the currency you would normally have to buy while this be not a guarantee that you will win its a fun competative aspect,pos
585,tldr my non recommendation have nothing to do with card acquisition or purchase but purely mechanic this be from both beta play and a little bit after launch as confirmation i want to like tes legend i really do not just because it be base in one of my favourite game world but because it have some really cool mechanic but some other core mechanic be absolute game breaker for me the good the elder scroll no seriously they have do great job of encapsulate the world and race into the card argonian have aggressive majika ramp nords rapidly turn into a hoard khajit get strong by steal from their opponent dunmar always get the last laugh even in death have play te since arena i be surprised how much this game capture the spirit of tamrial lane they add an interesting strategic layer to the game where you summon your creature matter just as much as what you summon do you throw a powerful creature into a crowded lane to thin the enemy rank or into a deserted lane where they have a clear shot at the enemy player match effect this type of game always gravitate towards fix meta have effect that throw a spanner in the work be a great idea it keep everyone on their toe the bad start hand size no i be not kid maybe this be not an issue for many but for someone unlucky like me this be a game breaker i play mtg and even with seven card i often struggle to get a balanced starting hand but at only three stare card i too often find myself wait to turn 3 4 before i can do anything meanwhile my opponent be already get creature on the field and deal damage often with snowball creature yes yes yes deck composition be important but the simple fact remain that with card range from 0 majika to 7 8 majika it be still too easy to get a starting set of 4 6 majika card discard your high and still have 3 4 cost card it be really really bad because it just so often leave the game down to luck of initial draw draw your really good low cost card you have get a strong chance get deluge with high cost card and you may as well give up before you even play a turn so with this in mind no no i do not recommend the elder scroll legend i want to but with entire game hinge on a 3 card draw i can not,neg
586,i love this game mandatory disclaimer i have be play this game prior to its steam launch in open beta and on the bethesda launcher so i be not new to the game however i have decide to stick with this game for various reason the main one be that it do a lot of thing better gameplay wise than it be old and much big cousin hearthstone the gameplay be fantastic and demand a lot more strategy and planning whilst reduce the rng to much low level i always feel after a game that i could pinpoint exactly where my deck choice deckbuilding or play ultimately lead to defeat or victory and hence enjoy this game a lot more competitively as there be just far few occasion where one big rng swing lead me to lose and often tilt for a while the prophecy mechanic and reduction in rng mean the meta be a lot more balanced with aggro actually not be very strong currently again unlike for tesls cousin hearthstone overall the meta be very balanced with various deck archetype be viable which make the game alwasy very interesting as drawback i would definitely quote the aesthetic of the game the premium be often not very impressive compare to what we know from other game notably gwent be do this very well but the big thing be the gameboard which really ought to be at the top of bethesdas direwolfs priority list as it be just the same grey scroll background whether you be in the main menu or in every single game overall i really love this game and be look forward to the competitive scene that will emerge and make use of the fantastic and skill testing gameplay,pos
587,early access review note pay no attention to the time as i get this game when it be on indiedb and get pretty far before let it collect dust while pursue other game and the fact i get as far as worth proceed in version 1 2 now for the review i be not really a person who could judge what be consider cute i guess the cardboard cutout be a bit amusing that say those same cutout be make me jump more than once when they appear after just barely escape an enemy that do not need to follow the path to catch you so in that regard i guess you could call them scary too i also like that it seem that the dev stop throw a cutout at you every other room like how they be in the indiedb version i play but outside of those enemy the actual enemy be terrifying and will definitely get your heart race on top of that if it be your first time play they can catch you off guard as there be no rhyme or reason for some of their appearance what i mean be that unlike other horror game good one that be there be a build up to an enemy appearance and on some occasion the rule to win against say enemy be lay out take for example the first resident evil the first zombie encounter be build up use sound effect to create an uneasy feeling of not know what be in the room with you follow up on that the rule for win be lay out as if you try to fight the first zombie a you will notice you use up almost all your ammo and b that you will take damage whereas avoid it you will notice thing like you be fast and more agile than the zombie well agile while use tank control so evasion be a preferred option when you can that be not to say that how the enemy appear in sphj be bad in fact the opposite the fact you do not know when you will encounter a type of enemy or how to beat it without try a few time against a new enemy add it be own eeriness as you do not know what the next room hold for you you have to constantly think on the fly and adapt even quicker however this bring up an issue i have with the game there be way too much luck involve i will give a good example the first enemy you meet be pretty easy to figure out just run but that strategy will bite you in the rear when you come to the first catwalk room that be what i call it at least the room with the narrow walkway that split in multiple direction if you just dead sprint you have a 50 50 chance of take the wrong path and get corner and that enemy take you out in 3 hit there be other point like this as there be an enemy i see in markipliers playthrough i have yet to encounter that seem to appear at random with no way to figure out what you do wrong or right in my case as again i have not encounter the red face enemy in any of my playthrough so like i say this game take alot of luck if you be go to get far or just alot of patience till you get that lucky run the other issue i have i be not sure if it be an aesthetic choice to encourage player to keep calm or if it be just how the game happen to be make the issue be that you have to press forward every time you enter a room what i mean be that you can not just hold down the w key and keep move as soon as you enter the next room no in each room you have to release the key and press it again to move this be really annoying against the aforementioned first enemy as if you forget this you will not move and take damage till you remember to release the forward key and press it again like i say i be not sure if it be intentional or not if it be not then i hope the dev will work on this as it be basically a cheap beginner trap but other than those two issue i do really think this be a good horror game and can not wait to see what the full release be like,pos
588,tf2 update have make the matching and find a game bit better but it seriously need to reduce the minimum number of people need to create a server small team will help in fast match,pos

592,early access reviewi also play on an ipad ios and android without steam so you can multiply my hour by 3 this game be very generous with free to play it give 5 decent deck to new player and about 10 pack per week and it will scratch your itch for ccgs quite nicely if you prefer your match to play long mtg then this be not for you i play like 3000 hour of hearthstone on 3 platform and the only disadvantage to eternal over hearthstone be premium card art animation be not as cool the upside be you should just always destroy your premium for the craft ingredient game use traditional random draw mana they provide plenty of dual land but even so you can get mana screwed or mana flood quite easily this be the absolute bad way to lose for new player there be as of jul 2018 a new expansion and we be kind of get into this be hard for new player territory we be not there yet but the next expansion will put us there at some point they will have to develop a standard format to support new player my current plan be to play the heck out of this game until artifact come out then jump ship this game be still 100 playable for new player as of nov 2018 you will just have to get advice on which deck to build and which card to destroy craft but like i say about 10 pack per wee outright give to you plus what you can buy with gold i e forge or draft or league which give you more pack,pos
593,early access reviewfracture space in it be current alpha state play well polish the development team be good at keep the news current and feature be add tweak in response to feedback from the community be there some good old alpha antic yes but they seem to be few and far between overall my only issue with the game be low player count lead to occasional long matchmaking wait time i expect that this title will continue to grow and when it be release in its mature state it will be phenominal as far as gameplay the control be pretty smooth and intuitive the battle can be intense at time your success be largely dependent on your ability to think strategically and respond tactically it focus on teamwork the leroy jenkins will fare poorly good luck and good hunting,pos
594,early access reviewi think the game be bad before sheesh i mean when i first play it a year or two ago it be playable now unless you like get spawn kill by tank light machine gun etc it be maddening to even attempt to play i would assume that it be fine if you pay for all the good weapon vehicle and what not but from the sole experience i have have right out of the gate i would not spend a dime on this heap of garbage if my life depend on it spend your cash on red orchestra if you want a decent ww2 shooter experience if you want a bad time you would probably be well off inject yourself with malaria then pour money into this let alone spend your precious time with it,neg

597,planetside 2 may seem like an amazing game at the start but as you keep play more and more you will notice the high amount of problem this game have and how bad it be in planetside 2 you have three faction the oppressive and communist like terran republic the freedom fight new conglomerate and the technology worship vanu sovereignty each side have different weapon one different air vehicle and one different main battle tank rest of the vehicle be common pool share vehicle terran republic be know for it be fast fire rate low recoil first shot multiplier and large amount of ammo per magazine however their weapon be a bit hard to control during medium to long range fight because of their high fire rate the terran republic main battle tank be the prowler it be equip with a dual cannon make it the good main battle tank for anti infantry combat it be also the fast tank in the game and be able to anchor it self onto the ground to fire faster reload faster and make it be explosive shell fly faster the terran republics empire specific fighter the mosquito be the fast fighter in the game have the fast fire rate and the high ammo count but the low damagenew conglomerate be know for be the hardest hit faction they have the high damage weapon but tend to have the low amount of ammo and slow fire rate their weapon have high recoil and the fast bullet velocity in the game the new conglomerate main battle tank be the vanguard it be the slow move tank in the game but it do the high amount of damage have the fast velocity on it be main cannon and can take far more abuse than any other tank it also be able to activate a short invulnerability shield which be at the moment pretty overpower it allow the tank to easily turn a lost situation into an instant win during close range tank fight the new conglomerate empire specific fighter the reaver be the hard hit fighter in the game but have the slow fire rate and low ammo count in it be weapon vanu sovereignty be know for be a very adaptive empire they do not have high fire rate like the tr or the high damage like the nc but instead their weapon be sorta in between the stat you would see on a tr and nc gun they be pretty much jack of all trade but master of none sadly the vanu sovereigntys main battle tank the magrider be a hover tank it have the low damage per second dps and slow velocity but it be the most accurate tank and be able to strafe and climb large mountain and building which the other tank can not do it be a tank that be make for dodge incoming enemy projectile and flank the enemy quickly the vanu sovereigntys empire specific fighter the scythe be the most accurate fighter in the game it have the fast velocity and the good air brake however it be the slow fighter in the game and do not have the high fire rate of the mosquito or the high damage of the reaver instead it be damage and fire rate be between that of a mosquito and reaver now that i have introduce you to the three faction i will just quickly describe what the objective be in planetside 2 in planetside 2 you have to capture basis for your empire the more basis you have the close you get to lock down a continent for your empire which give you a50 discount for equipment vehicle aircraft during the day you will have random alert which pop up give everyone the same objective like capture x amount of y or hold the most territory on a continent before the timer run out the victor get award with more xp and bragging right for the win in planetside 2 you can have up to 2000 player on a single continent atm there be 4 continent in the game so a server can have up to 8000 people fight each other in the future when they add more continent they will keep increase the maximum player cap each time by 2000 battle in planetside 2 be pretty spectacular huge tank fight in large open field multiple large ship fly up in the air do dog fight organize outfit clan work together try to capture territory for their empire it be amazing when you see it all in motion there be simply no other fps multiplayer game that can do this at the moment now that i be do explain the basic to the people who be new or be plane to download the game it be time to share the large amount of problem the game have let us begin 1 for a game that be supposedly all about work together as a team to win people tend to play the game as more of a large endless team deathmatch only try to get more kill and high kdr so they can get high level and get more medal yes this be an issue with the playerbase however the reason this happen be because the game be lack a reason for you to capture territory and win thing for your empire you get far more award if you go to a fight where you can easily get some nice kill than go to a fight where you be outnumbered and try to defend a base that be require to win an alert there be a large lack of a metagame and an endgame in planetside 2 if an empire capture a continent nothing special happen that empire only get a 50 discount for vehicle or equipment for a short time which make capture continent pretty pointless so after a few week you will realize there be no point in planetside 2 except to get more weapon medal and improve your stat which be really really sad the game badly need a good metagame and endgame so planetside 2 can finally become that nice teamwork large scale game about fight for your empire with your friend 2 the game have serious issue with bug low frame rate and constant crash the game just love to crash on a occasion the frame rate can hit such low level the game turn into a power point presentation even on a above average pc the game be infest with bug where your vehicle may randomly explode because you touch some rock at a bad angle or you be unable to access the map to respawn force you to end the game with the task manager and the list go on 3 the game reuse a lot of asset on different weapon alot of gun in the game look exactly the same and some even sound the same they badly need to update these model so you can actually tell apart which gun be which without have to check a damn description 4 the game have serious issue with lag and hitbox detection hitboxe in planetside 2 sometimes just stop work you may find yourself unload all your ammo into someone at point blank range just to find out you do 0 damage to him and you will die a fair amount while behind cover or go around corner since the game have some issue with lag compensation this happen very often nowadays to the point where i can hardly play the game anymore some of the worst dedicated server i have ever see in a video game 5 the game have a lot of problem with bug exploiter and hacker the game have a sewere lack of game master to keep server in check from hacker and people who bug exploit like clip thru a floor and kill everyone on a capture point inside a base or a hacker who fly around in a tank or as infantry and headshot you immediately if he notice you and than just teleport somewhere else planetside 2 need to have it be anti cheat improve and more game master for each server to keep thing in check so these type of people do not ruin the game for everyone bottom line planetside 2 will make you regret the day you decide to play it break server with extreme high ping a hit detection that work only half of the time a toxic unfriendly and bad player base that turn newcomer into more toxicthat keep destroy the community developer that fail to accomplish anything lead director that continuously lie to it be player and so many more thing which i sadly can not fit here,neg

614,many people who struggle to understand the core concept of this game would be incline to tell you that it be pay to win to of course diminish the fact that their profound lack of skill be not due to a lack of will or endeavor but that it be impossible to succeed in this game but this be untrue the very thing that they complain about and term pay to win be accessible to everyone from the very beginning of the game provide you allocate your earning correctly and understand how the game work the learn curve be quite steep so this be probably the reason for many quitting and term this a p2w the only thing that can be buy for real money that one could term necessary be the premium system wherein you earn 50 additional credit and experience the primary tool of progression so long as it be activate this provide absoultely no in game assistance but be merely a convienence tool to boost progression i myself use it as a full time student also work full time with generally only 5 or so hour a week to play the game any other core content can be earn if the childish playerbase take the time to learn the game understand the fundaental mechanic they would see the fruit of the game design and enjoy it the primary antithesis of this be the same as all multiplayer game the community be short temper and have a severe misunderstanding of the game if this game pique your interest certainly try and learn more before hop into play it will give you a significant advantage over those who choose to remain in ignorance out of self pity and lack of responsibility,pos

622,the game be free expect bug a way for the dev to make money and people and situation that willyou off i have only play for a few hour but the game be good as it be there be an open world mode and battle royal so you can choose to have a more dedicated play experience or just constant br thing the game lack the game be in dire need of some actual vehicle gameplay i think you can buy like 3 in the open world mode but even then i feel like the price be not worth it and the vehicle probably be not the strong idk though attachment for weapon i have see a few attachment lay around on the open world mode but never in br i feel like it would be well if less pistol spawn on the ground and maybe attachment or other thing the game lack in short this game would be the perfect f2p openworld br zombie game if it have a new map maybe upgrade texture or annimation and sound the sound be not smooth and zombie vocal cut in and out over other zombie attachment for weapon pistol spawn out thein small area you may walk in to a building and find 8 pistol yet not be able to find any in other area this review be not too well think out i justa want to share how i feel about the game in its current state,pos
623,i have play this game casually for many many hour off steam so that be why my time on here be low i will be brief about it because i do love this game this game should not be call a free to play gameif look at it from a free to play win game it be the most inarguably pay to win piece of crap that there ever be you only have a single decent weapon to start with and can only hunt two animal on a reserve that have 5 other thing you can not shoot at you can only unlock one gun without pay real money and even then it would take an ungodly ammount of time along with license ammo ect this game be not satisfy or entertaining at all without a membership and if you do get one it have some of the good gunplay graphic and experience of any hunting game i have ever play i highly reccomend this game for that reason because i have spend many hour tracking game tl dr not reccomendable unless you spend money on it great fun if you do,pos

627,early access reviewthis may really be the end of artix entertainment why make this ugly look 3d game aqw have an enormous fan base they have good 2d artist and they get a lot of money mostly because of appearance item aqw be good but outdated they just have to spice the mechanic a bit perhaps make a turn base game like wakfu dofus would be the good solution but no let us make an amateur 3d model game focus for mobile user eveyone go to love that idea artix entertainment what where you think,neg
628,s3 be a joke with random bs current season s4 an even big joke their designer clearly only care about a game that be fun to watch on the esports they do not care if it end up be really stressful to actually play the ing thing and now push eac when ther eis absolutely no need for it in this game and several well in house approach that have none of the down side hr they have no respect for you and the game be not even as fun as it use to be burry this,neg
629,theese be one of first game i play on my gaming pc and it work just fine but then it update a lot sense i last play and now it lag like crazy if you have good internet this be the game for you,pos
630,early access reviewa game try to do somthing interesting cross platform with mobile but all the pc version be be a slightly upscale version with no difference from the mobile version if they make the pc port better maybe it will be a good game i play a bit in beta and the game have some good thing go for it mainly its good humor but thay be not enough to carry this game,neg
631,to be more powerful you have to spend alot time in it the game offer large variety of weapon modification and vehicle this game be more realistic than most other game but like all game there be always space for improvement i hope that more map other game mode and more weapon perk can be add to further enhance the experience of the game,pos
632,early access reviewi play this when i be still in school apart from ton of other game i like it but the reason i end up quitting be because you have to pay to unlock perk location extra stuff or special item and quest that suck for a game that more kid and teenager play than adult or young adult so that s why i stop play if i want neat stuff i have to pay and as a 15 year old your parent will not pay for anything like this unless they just do not care about spend a lot on a game it be early access and i want to see where this go and here be all the pro and con in my own opinion of it so far pro fun game ok graphic fun story if you bother to read or watch the cutscene fun character include the monster craft system lts of thing come soon from the 2d game which be also interesting tracking system need work lot of potentialcon already pay to get ahead this ruin ton of game for me and it ruin this one for me year ago with its membership pay to get access stuff also i want to buy some potion and they cost 200 gem i have to pay real money to buy beginner pition too much farming i get to craft you have to farm but the ammount suck and everyone be farm the same thing cost to gain ratio very poor quest be the minor acception but the amount of gold you get to how much you have to spend suck really badly include how much it sell for and if you need material it cost 2x as much as what you have craft item be bad you pay 50 gold and farm to get somete get and craft someting better and sell the other craft item for 2 gold bad tracking system i can not find 2 quest because no matter where i go it will not track where they be so i never find them bag system too cluttered need something to sort or at least have it set up differently than it be now not major but its not good action bar i do not need auto attack to be there that s pointless also maybe allow that to be move around so i can have a potion in the action bar quicker than press u and use but i have not explore the key bind menue so that s probably my own fault do not get me wrong its good and i hope it improve but for a free game you pay for a lot more than membership i mean why do i need gem to buy starter potion why do i need to pay for item that should be free if i want to pay it should be for membership only or if i want to buy special item again pay to get ahead or to be well than everyone else game ruin the whole structure of a game and its content i get developer need the money to improve but to make a majority ptw that s go to make some people turn to something else if we want to pay great but why do so much have to be pay for with real money i mean if you have thousand of player and half of those buy regular membership and the other half the 50 option do not you think that not almost everything need to be pay for i will keep play to see where this go because i want to see how this improve but if it just stay as a pay to win kind of mmo then it be just go to sink to the bottom of the barrel like the 2d one do for me anyway and other game that do not rely too heavily on this system will come out on top this have so much potential but potential can only go so far,pos
633,i reccommend this game the pay content be far well than the free car and 1 2 price car u can get car and track really cheap at the moment also make sure the game work b4 u put money into it check the forum something may fix an isssue u have also a common problem the 503 error not able to connect should hopefully be fix in upcomming itergration patch with steam so u do not need a seperate log in go to my document game and delete the simbin fold fix my log in problem which i think be cause by a computer crash while game be run also one of the free track be pretty good and a hill climb free track and u can test drive car b4 u buy them for a couple of lap so not like iracing u have to buy and hope this be a lot cheap and more fun in my opinion tho i still use the iracing for other stuff like oval nascar this have wtcc which iracing do not and a lot more gt3 car 13 plus the dtm series,pos
634,early access reviewthis game be great i play the original for a very long time and i support it on kickstarter it be very fun those who enjoy a good mmorpg if you do not then it may not be for you,pos
635,i give it a shot and play it most of the day i have be need a new tcg since starcrusade ccg be be abandon after just a few hour i find the two main problem with it 1 pay for card always mean pay to win no matter what game it be 2 the random mana flood or drought i know mana flood and draught have always be a thing but even when i follow guide on how to minimize this or avoid it i could only get decent amount of mana and get my deck to work 2 10 time that say to me it be a balancing issue or their deck shuffling be garbage enjoy the game if you like it but for me it be just not my cup of tea shame to since i be save all my gold to complete a quest to join a draft i would probably return if they fix these two issue and stop make draft so damn expensive 5000 gold just to join one damn it be only 3000 for an event oh and one last issue the campaign be super short with only one additional battle after that if you want to play more of it you have to pony up some real world cash an option to unlock the campaign with cash or the in game currency would be nice like i say if you like it good on you but it seem their really hit people wallet hard game be great graphic wise and i enjoy the story though,neg
636,this game be the most fun when your playing in a unit platton or with friend but it be also fun to play on your own the fact that it be free to play but have many feature that require time and effort to obtain the option to buy the in game currency allow be at time overwhelming but if you just want to mess around and play without worry about the cosmetic and the in game currency which you get from a variety of source then this game may be a good option for the player that be not worried about cosmetic and work hard for the somthing they want in game or be willing to put money into a game but no matter what the game be very fun,pos
637,i love tower defense game and this one be rather fun at the start it be a pay to win type of game but even if you do not pay latter on you can win this a great game if you rival be either not hack cheating or 3x high level than you self yes you will find people that do not have to place out anything and will win no matter what i have a number of hrs in this game and like to play it but the cheat be too much pay to win on a free game be ok but never lose be bs game be fun but not recommend this game have way to many cheat hack its not even fun,neg
638,early access reviewgreat fun for a basic style of game the quaility graphic ship mechanic weapon dps etc it be so well ballanced could do with a few new game mode all round good way to kill some time brain cell and enemy,pos
639,early access reviewthe current state of the game be ed this be in the start really promising i really like the game and would have give it a positive review back then now you can not even get access to most of the stuff in the game because of the loot crate i can not even choose what stuff i get in a game where the player be suppose to design the vehicle not their luck now people who do not pay the developer have to get rekt by chaingun,neg
640,game be fun good substitue for magic until i notice i be not get the legendary card for log in every 30 day twice in a row a while back i check out of curiosity just now and notice other people be have the same issue so i want to let people know if you want a good game that balance what you can do with a card game that be online with the depth of magic try eternal card game pretty fun and so far have not basically scamme me,neg
641,early access reviewpretty good game to play not to long of a download and shooter can go a long way this just make it plain and simple very good game to pass the time with if you like quick shooter,pos
642,when i first get the game i be a little skeptical but after about ten minute i be impressed with it be realism and accuracy i be kinda a firearm fenatic and this game be a great learning application as well as a fun addicting game it seem as if it would be a great tablet game but so do some of the graphic during the target shooting but over all the educational aspect over weigh this for me all in all i would totally recomend this game for anyone who want a challange and addicting gun simulator,pos
643,graphic be great but if you want to see the enemy tank you can just use low setting and all the foliage be remove this game be so free they incorporate a setting that would get you perma ban in other tank or fps game the tank map be some of the bad i have see in a game with so many year they have not a single good map and the assault map be the bad by far also on the assault map the enemy bot tank seem to have little problem pull of shot while drive from almost a kilometer away with rank 1 2 tank low rank non upgrade tank also have this unrealistic thing that they can not turn unless go forward or reversing which create frustrating situation the grind be there for what ever reason i need to grind out 6 tank before i can buy a next ranktank its the law no matter that there be not a single tank i want from the current rank still get to grind out 6 to move on they be not all in the same line so you got to research at least one line more from rank 1 so that you have enough line open to research 6 tank go figure how many player will do that and not move on to the next game where epic be free to pick up tl dr tank suck and so do the map when it come to the plane it all look pretty and if you do not mind the balance issue which i really do not think can be work out in any game with this many different plane it can be fun to fly if you do not end up fly the low rank plane the premium time be way overpriced for what it do same with the competitor,neg
644,i do not where to start this game be amazing fun for me that be i really enjoy the mix of tactic and scale of the whole game be it for everyone no but what be breathe mabye i be go to keep this short since well there be many well review of this then what i can put out but yeah download it play it have fun or do not but i say u should so yeah bye,pos
645,this little gem be absolutely pant ly terrifying how i hear you cry surely because of the cutesy graphic it could not possibly be scary right wrong dead wrong ahem the soft graphic be what the game use to lull you into a false sense of security after gain your trust the game begin pile on the atmosphere like a dumptruck at a dumptruck convention after the first 50 100 room or so it become clear that the cutesy cardboard jumpscares be not the only thing plague you as you journey through what quickly become a monstrous hellscape bear out of your own nightmare the game also nod and pay homage to most genre of horror and even reference some popular horror game such as five night at freddys and resident evil the game be not very long but if you be a coward like me then you will only be able to play it in short 200 room burst if you be bored and look for a sp00ky time then pick up spookys house of jump scare and prepare to spend a lot of money on new underwear because trust me youl need them,pos
646,this game its free to play try but if you want to get the most out of it you be go to have to put some money down i have spend almost 300 and i be sure ill be puttin some more down on this one but i have alot of stuff and with lot of stuff come lot more gameplay with that say there be alot more i want i guess it come down to if you really enjoy something you will support it the game be relax i feel like i be in the great outdoors and that make me happy happy camper there be no rank up or play to unlock here if you do not like this then i would recommend thehunter call of the wild for me call of the wild be an arcade style game if you be look for a realistic hunting game then this be it but be aware there be a paywall but i know people that spend 500 on game like gta5 or any real free to play mmo if you love something support it its slow moving and some hunt be well than other but that s just it that s what keep me go 10 10 for me i be also aware that i can spend a bit of cash and most people can not but for 50 you can get the trailrunner bundle and you will be on your way with some great gear,pos

651,early access reviewi play many of artix entertainment game before my top two be bye far aqw adventure quest world and mechquest i be beyond hype when i hear it be ready for early access play the game itself be amazing for any past fan of the aq games the camera be off and the combat be stiff and there be almost no character customization yet one of my favorite thing in aqw be the customaztion and see everyone look differnt from eachother sadly you can not go 5 ft without seenig triple and of course there be the upgrade to guardin deal as in most of thier game these paywall be a drawback but its possible to enjoy the game without them at this time i would recommend the game if you wish to see it grow to its full potential if not wait a few month the game update fairly often,pos
652,look at the amount of time i have put in this game great concept i have fun but then i try play rank let me start with i work in the army as an infantryman i know what toxic people be like this game have the most toxic player base i have ever play with do not know how to function as a pro you get report do not execute every manuever with the synergy of a fortune 500 company you get report its very much a team game and in a world of troll and dbags you be not reward for try at all ill save you 200 hrs and tell you you suck stop play and why be you even try avoid this game,neg

657,early access reviewi be preach to the choir here i almost re download this game after not play for maybe a year i figure i would check the recent comment first since i see that recently it have a ton of negative review needless to say i be glad i do not waste my time sad to see such a awesome concept of a game go to complete waste on this f2p marketing scheme i hope someone copy the concept of this game and succeed great than these fat cat ever could have,neg
658,i have play this game for year on kongregate and when i see it on steam i download it immediatly this be a great rpg game that make you collect and better yourself with quest and loot however this be a game where you may need friend to make it an enjoyable experience you can lock onto your friend and teleport to them so you never lose them i strongly suggest get this game if you have a friend or two to play it with,pos
659,early access reviewi really enjoy the magic meet hearthstone gameplay and epic action polish of eternal it be very generous with free to play reward so you get a fun sense of progression and there be regular promo and event my absoolute favorite element of the game the one that keep me play it even when hearthstone be so much more polished be the wonderful limited gameplay mode there be forge sort of a version of hearthstone arena that be playable against increasingly strong ai opponent and there be draft even better reasonably effective asynchronous draft so you do not have to devote a huge block of time to playing or wait for the draft queue to launch and it be okay if you get interrupt etc very much worth check out if you like collectible card game at all,pos
660,early access reviewthis game be lot of fun it be heavily inspire by minecraft which i can tell but it be really original too since its free to play posibbilitie in game be endless if you have pretty good imagination and creativity you can build some pretty cool stuff but ya ill rate 10 10 for this game because it be simply amazing game i recomend this to anyone who enjoy play minecraft or any new people to the genre,pos
661,this game take away my life but i do not regret it it have hour of rage tear and joy you meet really nice people here and there be a large range of customization really the only thing i do not like about this game be that the staff will harass you for a month about change your inappropriate name and ban you until you do but overall its a good long game and i recommend it,pos
662,this be the good card game i have play and my new favorite unless the cyanide and happiness card game come to pc somehow it be get an incredible amount of tactical depth from be able to select an avatar from one of the elder scroll race to affect how you collect card as you progess through the game to be able to level up certain card when you your avatar level up i be 18 battle into the story campaign and i have be present with many story relate option that give me different card base on the choice i make there be also many different type to the card that be attribute to different stat as you play through the story or level up you unlock new deck that augment different play strategy base on the 2 main attribute that make up the deck in the deck editor you can pick up to 2 main attribute for your different deck what attribute you choose affect the type of card you can put in those deck there be some duel class card and a fair amount of neutral card that do not belong to any attribute mostly monster and dwemer construct from what i have see thus far but most card belong to one attribute strength intelligence agility endurance and willpower each one provide more card of that type that help its playstyle as you level up for example a deck of strength and intelligence would likely have a lot of magic spell and creature for intelligence and many creature item weapon that be focus on an aggressive playstyle in contrast a willpower and endurance deck would have a lot of small creature and way to augment them to be large tough from the willpower and a lot of card help you out more and more the longer the match go on from the endurance there be also the fact that there be usually 2 lane to the combat sometimes the lane have special effect that change what happen to creature in that lane for example there be a shadow lane that provide cover to creature the first turn they be place so they can not be attack by other creature during that turn there be windy lane that move a random creature from one lane to another and even an arena lane that give a random item to any creature summon to that lane with so many different variable and more be discover every few match this game be rapidly become one of my favorite edit you can only have up to 70 card in your deck and a minimum of 50 card a maximum of 3 copy of a card can be in your deck and some card be legend ultra rare and you can only have 1 of those per deck excess card can be trap in soul gem and will give you a number of soul gem base on its rarity and how many there be of it you can then use those soul gem to soul summon card you do not already have of course well card have high soul summon cost you can also collect gold from battle and use that gold to buy card pack or entry ticket to the arena battle up to 10 opponent with a randomly draw deck until you beat all 10 or lose 3 time chance for well than normal and more than normal prize or you can save them up to purchase in game dlc the dark brotherhood dlc appear to be able to be purchse a la carte use ingame currency yet another plus for the game in my opinion you can also earn more card pack in game through play and some of your card have different path they can be upgrade along,pos
663,the game be good only problem be that different intrface symbol or little picture should be label by explanation when hover a mouse the battle itself be variative interesting and skill dependent thank to alatriste for ad,pos

665,while i would whish i could write a positive review as the developer really create a small innovative potentially enjoyable game the free to play price just make it impossible the producer have obviously go berserk render the price for the stuff you can buy about 25 seriously twentyfive time too high to be anything even close to fair though one could argue as often do you do not have to buy any of the stuff that would just ignore dynamic of psychology which be so offensively exploit here high tier crafting be render nearly useless without buy the booster as craft one single high tier weapon take between 1 2 week with booster produce 4 5 of those weapon instantly can cost about 90a seriously bethesda software as there be up to 200 dweller to get equip apart from the definitly miss pause function and the continually be rip away from whatever you be just do by disaster and birth autozoom especially in survival mode pretty annoying the developer should be cuddle while the producer should be hunt out of their office with wet towel a shame really i would so like to give it a thumb up but the producer just spoil the lovely idea the developer obviously put into it,neg

682,probably one of the good game i have see in my life team fortress 2 combine the teamwork and the individual skill perfectly make you feel useful even if the only thing you have do in the match be kill a random person nine mean nine way of playing which actually translate in nine different game at least at first as soon as you start unlock weapon you will discover that you can play with a class in a whole different way refresh your interest for the game if that be not enough to keep you play this game forever valve release update every few month week or even day with ton of fix and more importantly addition to the game make you want to play more and more but that be not the good part everything important in this game be 100 free unlockable weapon which be the good part of the game will drop randomly as you keep play make pay user not well than free to play user no pay2win in this,pos
683,early access reviewi really be try to give this game some form of a chance but it would be unfair to tell anyone to buy this game in the current state it be in when you look past all the issue of the game it have potential but the reality be they will not be fix this game be delay in june 2017 to be polish even more but apparently they do not even spend a second polishing this game at all horrible google translation perma loading screen server and faction lock awful optimization 1060gtx 10fps on anything above the low setting disabled action combat and all of the feature plan for endgame the developer have make no announcement regard how they will address all of these issue the only issue they have address be that they be go to fix balance for damage and heal the least concern currently save your money maybe keep an eye on it to see if they may improve within the first few month but the current outlook make it seem like they have no intention of solve their error i have purchase the founder pack and have the two day head startedit as of 6 21 they have only make the game bad and seem to have no idea what they be do with balancing and overall make the game well combat have become bad and sloppy and they still have no intention of fix the lag or optimize the game,neg

688,early access reviewnot sure what all the negative review be for its alpha there will always be a bit of bug a server lag sometimes the dev on the other hand actually listen to the comuinity and there be update and patch frequently it be a super fun and good battle royale,pos
689,early access reviewlook i would love to give this game a positive review but i can not it can be fun sometimes but most of the time your team get whoop by the enemy team cause they spend more money on crate and nobody ever comunicate you will get a 1 1000000 chance of get one other person who will actually speak more than this team suck i be better than all of you plus this game be super pay to win if you do not get premium say goodbye to most customization option and half of the loot you earn i be not joke without premium you only get half of the loot crate content woah you get a legendary well first you get to pay premium for that also good luck get the part you need because everything you can sell for in game credit be only worth about 1 5 of how much in game credit it cost to buy the same thing you be sell for example ghoast module be a legendary item you get get it in the in game block store for roughly 150 000 in game credit you can only sell it for about 30 000 in game credit why there be so much more i want to say but i can not rant for too long so this be all but i have some advice instead of make a free game where over half the content be lock behind a pay wall which you should know to get permanent premium cost about 50 100 you should just make your game cost money instead make the game 10 20 heck maybe even 50 if your that greedy but do not lock over half of the actuall game behind a pay wall,neg
690,the base gameplay be very fun if maybe a bit monotonous great shooting mechanic and the fact you need to think about where and when you hit somebody add a lot in my opinionexample you be in a weak light tank face a heavy armoured tank who just spot you you could go for the body shot that will likely bounce deal insignificant damage on the other hand you could try to take out his turret by kill the gunner he will not die but he will not be able to return fire for a while now this work great on some tank and not at all at other there be also amazing detail in the different tank stats visual and general feel now the the reason i will never recommend this game in it be current state be after around tier 4 5 you will hit a brick wall in term of progression it will easiely take you 40 hour to unlock the next tank and you will need several tank in the same tier to continue progress the premium be one option even then it be a long long grind you will also feel another limitation in term of silver lion ingame currency not only will you need 40 hour for exp unlock you will also need to grind as many if not more to unlock a tank it be upgrade and if you think that be fair okay then just hope you do not get damage and have to repair that will set you back a few thousand silver lion you can actually lose currency from a match if you repair enough and last nail in the coffin lot of the premium tank real money be often way strong than the free equivalent leave you with a sour taste in your mouth when get repeatedly kill by them even when you get the first hit term of balance it be really bad mid tear but supposedly it get well at end game never get there,neg
691,very mixed feeling about this game i still play it a lot and it can still be fun to play casually but if you ever decide to go into rank and try to improve there be some glaring problem in the game mechanic that can not go unnoticed this game be not like smash in fact blue mammoth game try as hard as possible to be different from smash so the mechanic be different and in a lot of way simple however this do not mean the game do not take skill in fact i believe that brawlhalla actually have a pretty decent skill ceiling however become well at the game be not always fun especially when you be near the top you will soon realize that the punish game in brawlhalla be ten time harder than smash and some legend weapon in the game be downright annoying brawlhalla also utilize a dodge mechanic instead of the standard block and instead of grab brawlhalla require you to read the opponent and although there be read pattern people tend to follow and move that you can use to cover multiple dodge direction the enemy still have 9 way to dodge and 11 way to react i do not know why but i have not exactly be able to bring myself to quit the game yet i would always rage from rank but come back some other day and i think it have to do with how accessible the game be you can load up brawlhalla and be in a ranked match play a 1v1 in under a minute no joke make it a great game to play when you be short on time tl dr very fun casual gameplay aids rank the higher you go flawed mechanic decent skill ceiling compare to smash although annoy to improve at highly accessible when short on time also the lag holy atmatmatmatm,pos

723,a few year ago i be search the internet for hunting game and i stumble upon thehunter i play the game for a fairly long time since it be a one of a kind hunting simulation first i start as a guest it be a kind of trial membership but i become bored pretty fast since you only can hunt one species mule deer and only have one gun if you be willing to pay for a real membership you can hunt all the specie in the game and also get a couple weapon and unlimited ammunition for them eventually the company behind thehunter become kinda greedy and that change the whole game literally if you want to enjoy the whole game and want to take part in all competition you have to invest a good amount of money for example you do not have to buy every single weapon but then you will have a limited selection of competition you can participate in you do not have to buy every lure or whatever but then you have a disadvantage against other player who buy all the stuff you be not willing to buy and use long story short the free version of the game be just a playable demo in my opinion if you really want to have fun in thehunter you will have to invest a good amount of real money other review already mention the price so i will not go into that in my review if you be willing to do so you will get the good hunting simulation you can get at the moment it be nothing like any other hunting game out there here you will get a simulation for your money and not just another cabe arcade type of game unfortunately i have to give this game a thumb down since it become way too expensive to enjoy in it be full,neg

726,start out be not fun unless you dump money into a starter pack that actually let you play the game without be at an insane disadvantage in every way the entire time play it feel like it be badttlefield but then at every turn i get remind it be a f2p because i get to see the enemy team with 5 tank at all time watch four five rpg pickup off the map bounce off tank like nothing and almost every enemy run around with an mg42 while my team have no tank on the map at any point not a single gun other than the simple start rifle which feel a tad bit clunky on gunplay and nobody have grenade because you have to get a decent level to use grenade tl dr game bad almost rust freshspawn start effectively no anti tank start out p2w may not be p2w later on no clue yet,neg

728,diablo 2 ff7 materia system solid arpg with a very fun early game full of experimentation and discovery and a brilliant end game with great feature a lot of the space between can really really suck though as you bottleneck your build at the gear level need very specific number color and connection scheme of slot and need those setup on item with decent stat as well highly recommend for the most hardcore and the most casual normal player may find themselves bored and leave in the mid game or play a large number of character and fight with stash space,pos

745,this game be a mixed bag this game do not bring any new innovation to this genere game type this game have so much potentional of be good but fail upon that this game do not look anything that the thumbnail of this game suggest it look like more of a sci fi tank genre in the thumbnail then modern do not get me wrong i be not say modern be bad all i be say be many other company like war gaming have already do this type of game and theirs be much well in term of effect and whatnot there be frankly nothing exciting or new here i do understand that this be a beta game and i may change my review if the follow change more detailed map well graphic i do not mention on improve graphic in many review because i get the target auidence that the company be try to fullfill but i believe the target auidence for this game be for those who want immersion and a well graphical experince i understand that this be a free to play game but on that same note world of tank be also free to play with much well graphic well physic i be not sure what be off with the physics but i do detect something be dull about it i think the explosion of the projectile upon impact need improvement as well as mechnic of the tank itself need more gamemode not just elimination the gamemode be crazy fast need to be gamemode where you can select what you wish to play although i suspect that they will be add this feature later on the 60fps cap need to be remove i could not find such way to remove it in the setting tab let the user decide if they wish to have a 60fps or not i have a 140hz monitor with dual 1080 in sli and i want to get above 60fps and i be not able to the above point be make me lead into my second point they should support multiple gpu setup for those who have such luxary to do so i also notice those line on the edge of object e i tank box battlefield decor etc this be a result of have limit graphical setting with no aa option please fix this too give incentive to player who be not premium user so all the free user let us not forget that the free user make up majority of this game and there should be more incentive without make the premium feel uneeded but have the less pay to win vibe go on if these be fix i may give the game a second go but for now i can not recommend the game in its current state it be however a good time killer i suppose and that be what it will ever be until they make more improvement which give player incentive to keep come back and play more,neg

755,early access reviewway more polished than pubg also free the main thing to know be what difference it have compare to other game in the genre you get a starting loadout and there be actual spawn point you choose your spawn during the the 1 minute setup and you can see where other player be spawn as well the spawn be well space out this couple with the start equipment mean that the start of the game be less insane than other br game you never feel like you be take out before you have a chance to play even in the inevitable city frenzy everyone will have a chance to loot a house before it kick off the travesal equipment be the most unique thing about this game with each loadout you get a gun a piece of equipment medkit extra ammo ect and a mobility item you have a choice between hang glider snowboard and climbing kit with the hanglider you can leap off of any ledge and not only land safely but get a boost of speed in the direction you be go snowboard allow you to move at vehicle speed on any downward slope finally the climb gear allow you to climb at special place on the map that other player would have to take the long way around the climbing gear be not really as fun but they counter that by start you with a shotgun finally you be not fight till the last man team stand you be try to board a chopper with only 4 seat however most of the time it still turn into a last man team standing game but the fact that if you can create enough chaos you may be able to climb that ladder without be blast add a bit of spice to the end game,pos
756,  i have a couple 100 hour on the non steam version of this game gameplaythis game have a handful of thing to do but it mainly come down to you either go build or you go run out there with a train of other adventurer to slay monster over and over and over this game be the pure definition of a mindless grind serversthere be no avoid it if people talk about trove for long then 5 minute the server will eventually come up in conversation it do not matter really where in the world you be locate you could be within the same area as the server or you could be all the way across the world you will lag slip and slide like it be the late 90 on a dial up connection in the past they have stop this by put some aggressive queue in place but clearly they have just stop give a damn at this point directionthe developer seem to have no clue what exactly they want for the game they have move back on unlock class multiple time make them cash only and then not again and then make them craftable now there be a new class and i think hey i still have 13 class unlock token from back in the day time to have so fun with the new class but no instead they decide to not allow that to happen you better pay fifty dollar for the new class or do some unexplained new craft recipe even bad for the first day after release of the class you could unlock the class with the token there be one catch if you do so you get ban for bug abuse word can not begin to describe how dumb this be the lack of direction be not only something find in the how class system but across the board with the portal the dungeon or any of the multiple layer of convoluted progression this game have prosit be freeif you enjoy the kill part of minecraft the most you will find some enjoymentyou can submit your own stuff like dungeon and weapon and they can get add to the game consit be repetitive as all hellthe dev do not know what they want themselvesthe cash shop have everything from overpriced pack to rng box the server poop themselves dailyif you use item as intend you can get your account ban after the factthis game go down in quality start after the summer of 2015,neg
757,early access reviewbefore this review start to fade away and you have to click read more i will just state it simply that this game probably be not ready for most people especially those unfamiliar to the series it have a lot of potential however so if you like simple mmos you may want to go claim a nice name or something i also note that i have never play any prior adventurequest game but have play multiple mmorpg as of this review my character be level 5 adventurequest 3d be a very basic mmorpg i can not stress that out enough right now from character creation to combat most feature be very barren and unnoteworthy as of the current version limitation be a word that come to mind and it be probably due to the game itself only be at its beta stage customization have few option and there be only three or four if include the pay for class class the player have to choose from all of which be primarily dps base honestly i believe that the combat be what really get to me in this game it be bore and when put together with the general mmorpg aspect of grind be require get very grating there just do not appear to be much challenge all class have four move and a quick autoattack and most opponent be quickly take down with them teamwork be nearly nonexistant be basically just slay monster together by coincidence with little communcation there be so many people online and it be a shame that there be not any encouraging to work together early on as far as i be aware there be not even a party system but i could be wrong strategy unfortunately do not seem to be a highlight as of now map be small and host a few number of unique mob prepare to slay the same monster 30 time each with your same 4 move maybe with one random person who happen to be nearby while craft do prove to be an incentive make a cardboard crown make me very happy it be undeniable that it get repetitive there be a lack of a feeling of reward that some other game manage to capture probably because of the grind begin so early on the size of the map only add on to this feeling of repitition there be little to see other than the unfriendly neighborhood mob i like their design really but after see the same face over and over that sense of wonder become exhausted despite this the game do have character i enjoy the cutscene and the personality of the many npc which seem highly self aware it be funny description for item often have humorous joke in them still i just do not think that it have enough to keep me play for long however as say before the game be in its beta stage wander around the central town there be plenty of unopened shop for honestly interesting feature to come like pet and housing the creator of the game from what i can tell do want to hear feedback which be a good sign and perhaps if you be more willing than i be to play around you could help improve the game with your own suggestion it have potential but right now adventurequest 3d just feel too bare bone for me so if you really want to try this game go ahead i do not think most player will become heavily invest in it like with other game but it be worth a brief try if maybe for a few minute and who know what the future hold for this game it be probably good thing,neg
758,early access reviewi have to agree with everyone great game so far it be an alpha and it can be unstable it crash twice in an hour of play and there be not many upgrade or customization to ship but it be a lot of fun i remember another reviewer say it be unbalanced i actually disagree each category of ship have a very distinct feel and great strategic potential the problem be that most people play this game right now be just like you intrigue gamer just try it out a bit because of this no one coordinate and no one really try to win you also can not currently change ship type in game so if the other team be full of assassin and sniper and your team be make of nothing but flagship you be go to get your butt hand to you but if you happen to get on a balanced team it be pretty fun get it try it out love it anticipate the future,pos

772,i have hundred of hour in many digital and real life card game and this one be an overly complex mess riddle with borderline copyright theft from similar game especially hearthstone the new player experience be a ing chore with mandatory tutorial that blast annoying sound that the game take too long to allow you to get to the woeful option menu and turn off be this a pc game or a phone game because it have shity option for pc and the art be tiny and too intricate for mobile user it honestly feel like scumbag corp that bethesda have become just tell there art department to copy hearthstone and slap some unused skyrim art on the card obviously a lot of card game will contain similar ability and use of language but this game take the ingtrust me anyone with a thesaurus couldn have do better the game ultimately feel like the homer simpson car in which go for a deep experience mean take every aspect of all other card game and throw them into a bucket hey bethesda when you throw ever color onto the canvas all you get be brown goopy mud frustration aside be the sad fact that this game be so boooring like please end my suffer level of lame the game client be slow and unresponsive and the art all look like it have a brown tint not to mention the annoyingthe voice actor endlessly spew over the top of the cliched epic music which thank god you can mute the funny feeling you get while play this particular theme be wow i really wish i be play gwent which be probably what y all should wait for druidstone be a broken mess shadowverse be great but no one play it and gwent be not really out yet but even still i would not waste your time with thisand if you be still not convinced let me tell you the most scummy thing about the game they include how to purchase card for real money in the tutorial before you know what the hell anything even do from the creation club to this crap what the hell happen to this company that create classic like morrowind and skyrim,neg
773,access reviewi instal this game for free on steam this be an intricate battle royale game that look and feel a lot like fortnite there be four different class which all have their unique ability there be no vehicle and no sprinting but there be horse and that be okay but not as good the goofy white flag chicken be not realistic and become annoying to become and to hunt down i really enjoy play this game and i recommend instal it on steam,pos
774,very fun and entertaining game there be a lot to get use to and explore and i love this a while back but stop play it for a while and i be die to play it again it appeal to not just fps player but it be also a very strategic game building fob the vehicle and combination of a squad you can go with it be honestly just really fun to explore,pos
775,this game be absolutly awesome every class have its unique skill and every single one of them be greatgraphic be not bad and never get boringthis game may look hard at the first time but when you reach 20 hour of playing then you can not stop play and you want to play more and more but the good part be gameplay control be very smooth after 2 hour of playing you can find the class that be make for you i play a lot multiplayer game but from my opinion this game be the good multiplayer game ever make 10 10thank you valve,pos
776,run of the mill free to play experience by this i mean money waste mechanic design to do nothing but expend your in game money and make buying say money more appeal a gem upgrade system with a massivly high fail rate even at 90 hint its not really 90 or companion that require week worth of currency farming to upgrade arbitrary time waste mechanic that serve no purpose but to push the ability to sell speed up and to make sure you consistantly log in and push those active sub number up craft timer and diamond refinement limit be the two bad offender paywall for the most useful content good race or companion that do not die in a single shot cost real money though you can buy companion thru the ah its generally hundred of thousand of diamond to do so constant reminder to use the microtransaction store every time you log in the store icon be illuminate until you click on it minor gripe and the most common drop in the game be a chest that require a key that cost 1 usd you will amass hundred of these stupid thing and they will serve no purpose but to waste the limited bag space another pay wall for all its monetization fault its still a very fun game the combat be fast and active meaning you do not simply stand in place turn on your auto attack and cycle the same rotation over and over you be force to dodge attack and use positioning to ensure maximum efficency this put its combat right up there with gw2 or tera the map be functional but its very clear your traverse a video game if that make sense to you its an open world but a cell base one think the first 2 s t a l k e r game or gw2 the quest system be like any other mmo with a slight tweak where you get item reward before you turn in in some case pretty cool since you get that new item right away and do not have to run back to town for it by far the good feature of this game be the foundry system its basically a instance editior that give any player over lv 15 access to the tool to make their very own map instance if you be into modding or make map this will be a dream come true and possibly a way for you to never have to worry about money in game player who like you map can tip you in the game main currency this alone be worth play i just wish they do not nerf xp to the ground in foundry mission and instance i understand why they do it but you either chain quest or you simply do not level lot of fault lot of thing do right but overall i do not feel like these monetization practice should be support cosmetic i take no issue with but when you start gimp your game to push microtransaction i have a serious problem and this game do just that it do not feel like it do at first but by lv 40 you will be pull your hair out over the thousand of lose diamond from upgrade or the fact that nearly every single profession quest require specific laborer that be either purchase outright or require farming profession bag you buy on the ah for ten of thousand of diamond each,neg
777,wait spawn run die simulator 2016 10 10 ignseriously though what a load of crap the only reason i have put 40 hour into this game be because of the damn progression addiction and rank all i see be try hard with lmgs name get rekt nab or i love adolf so yeah if you would like a game where you spawn and in the space of 10 second you get bomb by a plane blow up by a tank snipe by a recon run over by a jeep or 2 shot by a camper with an lmg then by all mean give it a play,neg
778,have try a few other mobas namely dota2 lol and hot i could never get into them hot i play the most of probably due to my familiarity with the blizzard universe perhaps it be the camera view probably why i do not play rtss anymore smite have a 3rd person camera view that help me a lot to make another comparison it look a lot like world of warcraft so if you be someone who would love to jump into a moba but be really use to a 3rd person camera view like in wow or guild war 2 or many other game hell even god of war or devil may cry then smite may be a good one to try this review be not mean to rate the game as i be still consider myself a noob but more or less an attempt to help someone who may be on the fence about try it,pos
779,i wish i could leave a proper review but i can not why because after 4 day of reinstall and redownloade and do what the support team tell people i can not get past the opening cutscene i meet all the system requirement but when i go to skip the opening cutscene to get to character creation the program stop respond i can not fix this and pwe cryptic have no info about this specifically do not bother with the pc version as it most likely will not work at all,neg

783,broken game in its current state only because of how unbalanced it be way too easy to just save up and send regeneration rainbow bloon balance your game ninja kiwi not a fun game i know it say i have no time put into this game but that be only because i play countless hour on other platform when play a match you can either use your money to buy upgrade monkey to defend or send bloon at your opponent to increase your income usually that would be find but around wave 12 13 if your opponent save up money for a few round can just win with like a 70 success rate the ability to do this discourage player to get to further wave like 30 40 why waste 30 minute on a game you could end up lose when you can just save up at round 8 9 and send rainbow regen and win in like 10 minute you do not have to play many game to see how infest the online play be with this cheap dirty technique without a doubt the majority of player play like this and it make the game unfun to play,neg

790,early access reviewthis game could be one to rival pubg seriously the graphic be stunning and the world be far more detailed there be a ton of item in the game already and the gunplay be fine the game also run pretty well for what it look like although some more setting would be nice to make it run slightly well the only thing this game need be a progression system character customization more player in a game at once i would also say as a tip to the dev to keep the game free until they have fix stuff and add progression this game be good but at the moment pubg do offer more content if you be think about get this while its free do it its great no squad yet though edit winner winner with the dinner,pos

810,this review be more for the purist simmer and more of a rant in regard to the dcs be a fool gold sim comment ed have do a great job keep dcs in the balance between realism and inspiration by inspiration i mean include everything from graphical beauty immersion etc a lot of review have mention the same as far as the realism and overall i would have to agree like i say the game be balanced ok you could call it an intermediate level flight sim but people do go overboard with both the positive and negative look dcs rest just at the base of the mountain second peak we purist flight simmer call realism it attempt to scale this peak with some thing here and there but if i be to make a list it would seem the game be still in beta this will stir a lot of humdrum and i do not want to sound like the dcs be crap band wagon but i be sorry run falcon bms for a few year and any other flight sim turn into a cute and adorable attempt at push the envelope but dcs be not mean to be an ultra realistic sim it serve its purpose and quite well i may add can you program your entire flight plan and popup attack run no but its fun there be a blanket albeit a thin one but nonetheless a blanket of a generic engine the entire sim sit just in that narrow region between a very good flight sim and a you better do your homework flight sim despite what the lesser experienced may believe switch jet can be awesome but the weak link be the generic limit impose on the game this can be experience with the weapon system target aquisition etc be all very much the same when you get down to it i be willing to bet that if ed begin dcs by focus on a single plane it would be the great sim surpass falcon because one plane mean refine all other area but in dcs there be too much ground to cover but hey i appreciate what it be so heres my point the big kahuna play bms or falcon for the first time and you will not have a clue as to the reference of realism either way you will be mesmerize play dcs for year then go to falcon eh hem you will be lose now play falcon for year go to dcs and you will basically be able to figure it out of course after learn keybinding you will start mess with avionic and ah i see what they do there meh ok so ya look falcon be what separate the boy from the man when you be part of a virtual squadron who have real life f 16 pilot who appreciate the realism of the game there be no argument crewchiefs comnav and ew troop in virtual squadron who testify down to the mfd menu radar hud symbology technical order specification on and on i mean cmon in its own realm falcon be far from perfect though but all i can say be if you wanna have a highly acceptable and fun combat flight sim experience then dcs be well within par i love it but if you wanna go from highly acceptable to down right prison rule school pick up bms in the word of forest gump that s all i have get to say about that,pos

816,i have always be a fan of card game but this one be very punishing to new player the short end of it be when you start the game everyone else have well card than you and for the most part even if you outplay them and make good decision their card be just significantly strong than yours so they outvalue what you have arena be okay because it take most of this away but then again it seem like people get more legendarie and rare than you do in arena i be almost level 30 and i still lose around 75 of my game the only fair match i seem to have be against new player like myself who do not have an extensive collection of card i do not think this game be bad but you definitely have to play a lot to be able to compete with other player i also mostly play casual where i get match up against people who have be play for a very long time so that may be different than if i play ranked i love watch youtuber like cvh and justinlarson play this game and how creative they can be when craft deck but then i realize that it be ultimately impossible for me to create an ideal deck when i have such a minimal collection maybe in time i will get enough gold to be able to get a collection worthy of beat player who have be around for a long time but until then i be go to continually lose all of my game unless i be play against new player or long time player use trolly deck edit invest even more time into the game and it be still pay to win after 100 hour i still lose to everyone because they have well card so frustrating,neg
817,early access reviewbasically robocraft be quite a nice game but it really have some issue now there be go to be enough review with pro and con and the like so let me make this short there be only 2 reason this game get a no from me currently 1 there use to be a time be rail heli be niche hard to properly create and play but they be fun and really useful in the right hand too your rail be rather unprecise due to the bob up and down of the rotor blade mean in order to aim properly you have to act against the bob add an additional layer of skill to actually play a competitive rail heli even then you trade some of your accuracy for mobility now though in a real fight you can expect lot of freak misfire that just hit the ground 20 meter away from be the red dot be speak of which what the frick do i need a red dot for if it be not relate to the spot i will be hit at all i already have a reticule to make this issue weird i can not recreate this problem in the training mode at all 1500 ft and i still get 5 out of 6 shot on a target more than half a map away all while move up down and across the map maybe they be cause by be damage i do not know but it be annoying and the accuracy loss during fight be way too big i still can play my rail heli that use to kickhalfway decently but the constant freak misfire which be not directly my fault and can not be prevent by anything aside from get another bot type be take a lot of fun out of the game it just will not feel right and yeah that as an airborne player be still a large issue than flak cannon or the like to me 2 the score of the win team have be double aka carry scrublord exceptional player on lose team if just they would change those 2 thing this game would get a full recommendation from me and i would sink a lot more time into this game too as long as those be there thank but no thank edit 21 06 2016there be a lot of nice new feature like smart weapon and stuff it be actually quite nice aside maybe from whiner acommodation aka flak and i really want to get hype again for this game but my personal playing niche have be completely kill off and since it be still as dead as it get my review stay negative,neg

830,i do not know where to start this be the first time i feel the need to write a review i spend 30 minute read review on forum and here in steam 80 90 negative and that comme from player with 2k to 7k hour spend on the game about the last patch and as someone who have play this game since dota 1 i have see a lot of change some be good and some ofcourse not but you could have get along with them and even start to like them however this last update 7 00 be not like them it completely change everything to add so much new thing in one time it be so unbalanced and with the tree skill every hero be different now the support be carry and the carry support it be like i have no knowledge of the game about the visual the new hud be really small keep in mind many people play on standart laptop size 15 6 and the health bar be hard to watch when it be on the bottom instead on top of the skill bar it will really be good if after all the change you get the option to adjust all of those for example to expand the hud like the map size i would like as many other the new update to be a new game like dota 3 so a lot of people have the option to play the last game patch 6 88 we all like but i know this will not happen unless a lot of people leave the game or professional player do not say something if the idea of this update be to draw more people to the game keep in mind be it worth it and will they be more than the one leave it i personally will not be play it unless some drastic change take place which most likely will not happen,neg
831,early access reviewi ve be play this game on and off for two or three year now and here what i feel about the gamein the beginning there be creativity i would fight other bot that resemble badfuturistic tank air and ground walker and bot that ressemble creation out of movie like star war or halothere be balance in chasis cube and i do not mean just the cube i also mean armor you would see decent build with a little bit of armor for protection and overall have a balanced fight in a matchhowever i have start to play again for a few match and i be up to find some of the keything that make this game fun be while not go slowly be use less than they originally werei see more armored turtle with gun poke out in a match then i see a decently build creative cool look battle machine these day and i think that be mostly because armor have get far too important in build a robotnothing seem to be balance anymore in term of creativity and building balance of cube and its really upsetting because this be and still can be a really fun game to play and i do not want to see it go down the tube just because the development team do not do anything to bring the creativity back that stuff on the new cover for the game be never see in a real match because if it be it would be incinerate by hover build cover head to toe in armor the creativity to make robot be still very much in the game but the match themselves make it impossible to win with these creative bot because they get destroy by these other robot that be cover in part so high in defense that they shread you to piece before you can do some damage so if the development team s ever read this then please do something about balance out these part so that it be not impossible to win a game creativly and to the people read this review i say to give robocraft a try its not a bad game it just can be frustrating at time but if you find you re always get frustrated and always get destroy in match then i would reccomend to just play something else and stay update on robocraft to see if the dev fix these problem that have be occur and if you do not feel like wait then i be sorry robocraft have disappoint youthese be just my opinion on the game so please do not harass or synically bash me over the head through the internet because i be try to helpful while still positive for a game i really want to pull through,pos

849,early access reviewi recommend this game only if you want a more accessible and enjoyable version of mtg after collect most of the card the game have to offer and after play gwent i have come to realize that both eternal and mtg be too often decide by luck and very little by strategy you start with 7 card let say you get lucky and start with this hand 3 be mana 1 card cost 1 2 card cost 2 1 card cost 3 and you draw all the right card in most case you have just 1 viable play to make honestly i feel that a large starting hand be require to call it a deep strategy game after the fun of collect most of the card be over i get bore quickly after log in each day even after the new set this boredom do not seem to go away,pos
850,i recommend this game because it be really fun and do not frequently frustrate me beyond limit favourite feature like how you can bring your house with you anywhere you go instead of run a mile away from your house and then have to backtrace and maybe even lose it you can really explore beyond limit on this game least favourite feature this may just be my friend and my opinion but i think that some item be ask for too much material to be craft or too rare material i suppose it will keep you search and explore maybe this be not a bad feature for some but sometimes i just give up on try to find item i rate this 8 10very good and addictive fun to play with friend and to compete for well item house and much more,pos

853,there seem to be a lot of negative review on steam about this game especially revolve around the pricing structure and while i agree that the price look quite high i have to say that i think the item be so good that to me they be worth the outlay you get what you pay for and the quality here outshine any misgiving regard price graphically it be stunning especially with everything turn high and run at 60fps with 22 car on the track for which i be refer to dtm experience but the hot lapping in the base game with ai turn on give you an insight into what the finished game will feel like and in my opinion they have get it spot on i can only assume that the base game be yet to be optimise because i get low fps on the same track with only a couple of car out than i do with the 22 car in a full race of dtm same graphic setting for both but with a 10 fps drop in the base game sound be incredible i have never be so engross in the sound of any game as this one and play with headphone on just highlight the beauty of these car gameplay be great especially on the get real setting althought the ai need a little bit more speed as its currently too easy to catch and overtake i be currently use a razer sabertooth gamepad and once setup it work perfectly but i can only imagine how much more fun a steering wheel would make this and it be the game which will likely push me to make that commitment it be that good that i have buy pretty much most of the buyable stuff except for a couple of livery option within just a few day of try it edit may 26th 2016after have set myself up with some decent hardware to get the most out of drive game i can say that this be my favourite driving experience on the pc i own most if not all of the pc racing sim but there be something about raceroom that make it very special to me and that be the feeling you get from the overall atmosphere that this sim create from the sound to graphic to drive feel once set up correctly this be such a cool experience with ai that can keep up and give you a thrilling racing experience,pos

873,early access reviewone big thing i do not like about the game be how hard it be to even try to kill lower level monster moreover the skillset be incredibly difficult to remember very confusing and not at all suitable for anyone look for some casual rpg fun alienate the casual player base will make this game population too small for it too see any real long term success,neg

877,the game be solid i have about 38 hour on my steam account but i have play the game for about 200 300 hour before it be on steam it be a good game you can check its undeniable quality among good review around but it have serious issue that still have not be resolve after all these year the faction balance be very poor in regard of the vanu they be always and it be be consistent for 3 to 4 year more numerous than any other faction which make it almost impossible to win big battle against them or even small skirmish since they have the most veteran of the game edit i re try the game for the first time since a few month and i fight and die instantly against swarm of vanu player that have 20 30x more time in the game than me so around 4000 gaming hour each the game be now half empty and the player leave seem to be all lvl 2000 3000 vanu veteran that will murder you without give you a single chance of find fun in the game just so it be clear you can not properly play solo to the game if you be not with a considerable team it be extremely complicated to join big squad for large battle on the fly plus there be not really any chain of command so order either get lose or it be pure chaos which can be fun util you go back to my first point you can not win against vanu if you do not organize your assault properly sure you be go to have some great moment if you try just to play alone even in large scale assault but they be not go to be enough to outgrow the constant frustration the f2p model be not quite f2p sure you can stick to it and not spend a single penny on the game and you should fare just ok but it bring an even more massive problem the progression be terribly slow it be fun to fight and get point to spend in new skill weapon vehicle aerial and terrestrial upgrade for your shield for the ammo you can carry for the weapon of your vehicle etc until you realize that you need the same type of currency win in game to unlock them all you can not get say currency without play a lot if you be outrageously lucky and proactive you can get up to 200 250 point in an hour of gameplay but this be barely enough for two or three level of any kind of upgrade and i be not even mention weapon which can cost a few thousand and not be worthwile or be completely unfairly strong you can get these point a lot faster by pay the premium fee plus a few other bonus the game be not p2w but consider the really really really useful and advantageous nature of the upgrade you can get for everything in the game player who pay get a lot strong a lot faster finally my last point concern the state of the server it be actually pretty good with a little twist this be a massive scale fps making battlefield look like a claustrophobic nightmare therefore for the server to pick up the information come out of your pc to transmit it to the server and to do the same with every other character and object in the game that take a gargantuous amount of bandwidth if your connexion be not top notch top tier top whatever you want you will be gravely disadvantaged a lot more than in any other fps in comparison i have a pretty lousy connexion at the moment which be new to me but i fare just well in rainbow six siege in ps2 though i be barely more than a move meatbag with a shoot me sign on his back so tl dr all in all planetside 2 be a good game if you do not mind pay for the premium access or if you be really patient if you have large team like a guild or something like that to play with at all time if you be lucky on the amount of vanu against you and if your connexion rock this game be a must but without all that it be go to give you a hard time pretty much all the time try it it be free after all and make your own opinion on the game,neg
878,never think this be go to be my first steam comment as a mid range control deck player i hate this game so much the balance be awful sometimes i can not stand it any longer as i usually do because the new set of card be ridiculous just pick one card like avigraft it be so overpower and overpush and the influence requirement be low also the backfire be nothing meaningful at all one card can can be use as a kill spell and a forever lockdown at 3 mana power cost only with a slight backfire compare to ciywide ban avigraft be on a completely different power level since i do not tend to be a copy deck cat cancer meta deck player i do not think i will stay in this game if nothing be go to change to conclude this be a good card game with small issue,neg

883,i have 1400 hour in this game and i do not recommend anyone else begin this game i have not spend a penny and have great deck with lengthy win streak 10 however day will go by with 20 25 win rate i create a new deck and see a streak of win then day go by with low win percentage the creator have make a good game and have metric for all card include win rate with a card use a payer may have an advantage in draw over a non payer once the system metric discover a high win rate by non a payer create a new deck hour will be waste here waste save the troll comment i have hear you,neg
884,the gameplay be good but not very competetive my great issue with the game be the terrible support and the unstable build only usable guide be make by fan extensive issue when even the slight problem occue during setup phase i can not change the re outside of a battle and when i change inside a battle it cause the game to blackscreen an issue persist after restartee the entire game and try to join a new battle and when i try to verify game integrity it lack about 6000 file some of which it could not re download due to not have the privilage to gain miss file and i re instal the game just 12 an hour ago tl dr decent casual game terrible build and stability,neg
885,early access reviewwhat the hell happen to this game in the early day of early access i put in over 300 hour and pay over 200 for premium time and item it be balanced and have well feature such as a tech tree to unlock item vehicle tier and level it be fun to climb and earn the tier and level it be a fantastic game after a year away i just spend 30 minute in the game and it be absolute crap now its just a damn money grab with the crate i will never play this game again and i recommend that everyone stay away from it as well,neg
886,i have like fallout shelter since it be release on ios however since i do not use my phone too much regularly it be a pain to play it due to it be a game you kind of have to watch throughout every day the game be port to steam be 10x easy on me to remember to check it because i use steam at least once a day fallout shelter be a sim like game base on the fallout series you take the role of the overseer of a vault and must keep thing like food water power and happiness up for your vault dweller on top of that you must make it so dweller can survive attack from raider and creature with armour and weapon even though you can pay for micro transaction it be not need because you get a few of them near the start of the game that will help you with weapon supply armour pet and vault dweller to help out the survival of your vault i would give fallout shelter a 8 10 as a nice little time waster,pos
887,i can not believe this be free this game be amazing it tell you everything about the gun when you take them apart and put them together it give you hint name of the part when you click on them the control be easy to learn and teach you step by step on how to move forward if you love gun or like to learn about them then get this game can not stop play it,pos

892,early access review o i use to highly recomend this game now with the new loot system loss of a tech tree and lack of block teir there be really no reason to play it if you play it for an while you will get everything you need or want or you can just pay for it sadly it look like the money man win out with this game they get rid of all the good stuff so little kid can just hop on and get everything they want or buy what they want if you want a game that will challenge you to build a machine that take time effort and game knowledge your look at the wrong game now this have go over to the kiddy freemium side it be a great game that make you want to work to unlock well gun wheel and armor now you can just get the good item in the game if you do well in a match i leave after the huge bot update that have everyone hidde behind the big bot in the front because it get really boring like cod get you just shoot back and forth until you kill the medic bot behind the huge bot so i leave and now when i come back hope to find that they even thing out and maybe add a few more game mode i sadly find a great game have be gutte inorder to make more money it kind of seem like the game manager go on vacation leave the money man and the scripter to go nut while there be some new funish macanic there be now a lack of any restriction want a sniper medic aa bot sure why not kid have fun we use to have to carefully craft our machine for a role like defender attacker wall tank you name it we have to come up with a solution on how to fill that roll we only have so many bot to make before they charge us for it make us carfully construct our machine now you get as many slot as you want and can go bot happy while i do like that they use a workshop allow you to use other poeple bot design as long as you have the stuff for it that be a small plus in all of the new negative aspect of this game,neg

896,my review of hero general aka thing i like and thing i do not like let us start positive thing i like it be a free online ww2 shooter it have character customization that be not too unrealistic except for some weapon skin it have everything you would expect different weapon vehicle 3 faction and different class progression they give out the odd free item shooting be enjoyable i only try 2 weapon though there be weapon and character upgrade thing i do not like it be a free online ww2 shooter so expect bad team player connection server issue premium currency and premium status that grant a bonus to xp basically make you unlock well weapon quicker quite unfair your starting gear as the us an m1 garand that be it you have to level up to unlock a knife pistol grenade you know thing every soldier have that be not really as handy as a rifle ultimately this make match so god damn dull i never once think i would begin to get bored of the m1 garand sound but when all you hear be puff puff ping puff puff puff ping ping for an hour straight it will drive you mad battle be really empty so much so it seem too quiet to be a battlefield again dull wow i can change the colour of my helmet and the colour of my uniform but wait i will only ever see it in the menu what be the point hell when change helmet the display do not even update i have great internet connection play a lot of multiplayer match in other game not one issue this game rubberbande every 15 in second i play almost 2 hour and it be infuriate literally no other game i own have that issue save up for that one class you want be not go to make the game any better i have just about have enough of the connection issue and decide to play until i could afford to play as a paratrooper band of brother style do not help very disappointing animation for the character and the plane not to mention you can get shoot out of the sky by anyone with a gun who look up and save up for that character end up give me less option to customise stamina system for a soldier you really can not ing run far the general part you have to put a lot more hour in than i do i love strategy game and i have play thousand of hour of them on here and i be 100 sure i would have be disappoint with that mode too most thing in the trailer screenshot barely happen and obviously be set up except for that stupidcycle every time i see a german tony hawk i focus fire on his sillyas he struggle to turn the damn thing drive remind me of garrys mod addons i really want this game to be at least decent and satisfying and although i win almost every match i play i be still disappoint would not recommend i would prefer to buy my friend any brother in arm game instead of waste their time with this cheap trash,neg

901,i will start with requirement forget requirement in description those be for old client right now you need high end game equipment to play this game smooth and nice or you will need to run in potato mode somebody mention it early multiplayer be laggy bad part be when you be in the middle of opperation or just take off from airport and somebody connect to server allready dozen time happen that crash happen because so much lag i do not mind ai it be pretty decent if you want to learn and practice use low setting if you be up to more challenge make the ai level high and if you be hardcore just join some pvp multiplayer the simulation level be marvellous you can actually fly modern military aircraft which be mostly impossible to ever fly for most people on the earth lack of finish on most recently release model can be frustrating but it be a well learning curve for newbie you do not have whole plane to learn but in part by part i be not really into helicopter and ww2 or cold war period plane but for modern i must say they be awesome get a decent hotas grab at least gtx 1070 but i recommend 1080 vr headset and get ready for some amazing experience,pos
902,by the egg a fine battle for reason unknown i be enjoy this far more than i ever do hearthstone perhaps it be the refined mature art style perfect for a gentleman like me perhaps it be the class system and abundance of card provide just the right amount of freedom and choice whilst not feel overwhelm the business model seem fair as well get ready for the face smashing grind against ai if you want to accrue craft gem as a free to player though i have even have my fair share of fun creating deck to deal with the a i all in all it be not another hearthstone clone for me it be a well game and a fair one at that psst i have already spend 5,pos
903,this be not actual yu gi oh this game follow a speed duel format which completely change the game instead of 8000 lp you have 4000 lp instead of 5 monster spot and 5 magic trap spot on each player field you be limit to 3 instead of 40 card deck you can only choose 20 30 card you also draw less card at start of the match all these change combine mean the same old card now perform completely differently than you would remember pay 1000 lp to activate an effect be 1 4 of your lp instead of 1 8th also all of your old deck literally can not be build as the deck space cap be now low than the previous deck minimum so what exactly be the motivation to play this game i can not use any of my old combo i can not build my old deck and most of the card i remember have not even be add to the game yet i can not recommend this game in any way shape or form,neg
904,update 17 oct 2018 a lot of the recent review be negative because of rushed client update on 25 sep 2018 break stuff as of 17 oct 2018 the new patch have fix almost all of them and the game be in a superb state now i play mostly on mobile so my actual playtime should be around 1000 hour and i would like to say that this be the good digital ccg in the market for mobile at least since mtg arena may compete in pc the lane system make the game skill intensive and the limited amount of rng make for a good streamlined game if you play hearthstone and hate the insane rng trust me that this be the game for you there be con ofcourse the mobile client be slow to load and disconnect if your wifi network drop even for a second but a new client be on the horizon and that should clear up these technical issue pretty much the amazing soundtrack art be also a refreshing change from the usual cartoony art comedic soundtrack that you find in every other hearthstone clone out there esl be in no way a clone of hearthstone regard the p2w aspect that other review be complain about you can get a near complete collection with a couple of month invest into the game without spend a dime it will require some grinding but that be expect in any free game especially ccgs tldr good mobile ccg in the market right now if you want to play a ccg that involve skill and have epic art soundtrack,pos

907,early access reviewedit apparently 20 minute do not justify this review as vaild if we ignore the psychology of make snap judgement and the fact i know what kind of game i like i be go to give a long review base on my short time and explain how i game to my conclusion of not good why i do not feel someone else would enjoy it this do not make me a hater because i really enjoy the 2d adventure quest the gameplay you move with w s and a d turn the camera around behind you you can also move the camera around with the mouse basic click on thing do action base on what say thing be collect loot be annoying with no real feedback on if you actually pick up the loot and you can only pick it up by click on it not by walk over it in my short game time i manage to get through the intro stage and to the main town enough to firgure out the gameplay be fairly standard drivel nothing exicting nothing fun nothing that get me hook i do not really have much to say other than i do not enjoy it the interface it be awful you can tell it be design with mobile in mind and then the interface for mobile be just update to work on pc game can be design to work on mobile and port to pc just fine see timberman that be orginally a mobile game and this game do not do that very well the font be awful and i could notice some of the texture do not scale nicely to 1980 speak of texture the graphic i really like the design and style of the 2d game it look good and have a nice aesthetic to it i be not a graphic over gameplay kind of guy and do enjoy game you could argure have poor graphic proteus for example or moirai however this game be sell itself as a mmo that mean it be hope i will play it loads if that be the guess i be kind of hope for something a bit well it have ps1 esquie graphic and not in the good way i be guess this be because of the fact it be design for mobile the writing story you may feel i can not give a fair review of the story and i would 100 agree with you i be go to talk about it anyway the writing be dire cringe worthy and really unthoughtful you can tell it be not do by someone who know the first thing about write it be not even do in a casual way just bore unfunny unwitty word on a screen it do not hook me in it do not want me to find out more or want me to play it be just bad in summary i find this game bad and i do not enjoy it if you play hour upon hour of the 2d game then this be go to suck and you will not enjoy it if you have never play adventure quest before then who know you may enjoy this but it be nothing like the game it be base on personally save your time and effort and try a different game original review give it 20 minute of my life in those 20 minute i find out it be nothing like the game i waste so many hour in high school in it have lose a lot of charm on the way poorly write cringe worthy joke an intresting feature be that you can play the same game on the pc and your phone eventually do mean the pc verison be scale quite far back do not bother waste your time on it it be free but i would feel insult if i have to spend money to try that out,neg
908,early access reviewfantastic game with frequent content update play very similar to magic the gathering if you be familiar with that game but take great advantage of the digital medium use a resource system that require you to draw you resource from your deck so there be variance build in where you may have to deal with not draw enough to little of your resource but they be have be good at add game mechanic that help deal with these issue this game be also extremely generous with it be free to play model and it do not take very long at all to collect craft the card you need for competitive deck overall it be a great game and would highly reccommend to anyone look for a fun free to play card game with deep strategy and decision making,pos
909,in my opinion this be one of the good multiplayer shooter available today there be something for everyone wheter it be tank drive air battle support wether as medic or fungineer platoon squad leader or just walk around shoot people no matter what you do you will fall in love with this game and its community and everytime you boot the game up and join a platoon you will remeber why download and play it now you will not regret it unless you be extremely impatient and can not tolerate death,pos

916,path of exile have to be one of the most enjoyable rpg game i have play since diablo 2 lot of player will tell you as will i have you sink countless hour into the diablo franchise and be ultimately disappoint by diablo 3 this be the game for you a player since open beta this game have come so far in term of class expansion level development progression and the unique orb reward system which the game economy largely revolve around the 3 month challenge league release by the developer keep this game new exciting and fun while simultaneously introduce new skill gem for awesome monster smash alter the passive tree to keep player build dynamic and fresh and to prevent face roll because let face it path of exile will kill you with 6 different class to choose from and countless character build if you enjoy individualize your character i strongly recommend this game overall i rate path of exile 9 10replay value countless hoursdifficulty hardcore player beware casual player also be warn you will lose 10 exp for every death economy with the introduction of customizable hideout trading be well in need of a more dynamic and integrated trading system orb be awesome double function as a mechanic to alter gear or trade up for well con time investment be huge i e learn how the economy work what can kill you virtually everything if you be not pay attention 24 7 mainstream build do exist in both hardcore and standard league limit to individualization but still doable storyline be lacklustrepros itemization monster synergy skill effect and passive tree design in a unique and fresh way that challenge the way we think rpgs should be play i could go on and on but honestly just download the game look up a build online and give it a shot you will find that you can not stop play take it easy guy and good luck god of warrior,pos

918,well i can see how people be mad that these gun cost money and that the start game be free however i would like to point out that a lot of these gun be complex also the company probably have to buy one of each of these gun and then find someone qualified to take them apart without fail and damage them and then they would have to either make a 3d model from each and every one of the part so that would be either they would need to take a picture of each and every angle of the part for 3d or they would have to make the part in some kind of 3d art software either way it would not be fun nor easy and you have to take this into consideration also i make up most of the thing about the 3d stuff those be idea of mine as to how that work and i be guess but still to aquire a harpers ferry flintlock pistol that would be hard anyhow i be a gun enthusiast and if you have these gun irl you would know its worth it to know how to take them apart all the way to clean them edit alright i play the game a bit more and i hit the wall there be a problem with this game earn to win system so effectively it be a pay2win free game so basicly look at the dlc and add that cost in and you have the cost of the game still worth it to know about these gun if you have them irl,pos

921,this be basically a hearthstone rip off will elder scroll lore that do not mean it be bad though list the pro elder scroll legend allow more freedom when it come to deck build no need to restrict yourself to 30 instead you can have a max of 70 card if you want the art be really nice and the plethora of card you can make and get equal nearly unlimited deck building that s mostly where my compliment for this game end this game be not heavy on ptw in my opinion however it be highly rng base you play a 10 minute game successfully put up guard lethal charge those be type of card whatever you may want only to go from about 25 to 30 health to 0 to 10 in a matter of 2 turn people in this game either play extremely defensively to the point that you be fight an indestructable turtle or they play hyper aggressive with lethal and vampire card now that i get the salt out of my system from lose 4 consecutive match with a strength willpower deck to a bunch of agility endurance deck good luck beat them this game be all and all basically just hearthstone with more depth and more freedom if you like that play it oh and this game be free which be nice,pos

924,yknow i have always enjoy bloon since the first game while this do not exactly play like the previous instalment in the series it be absolutely a welcome change to me basically rather than a hoard of bloon that be set by the computer you play against other attack with your own bloon while try to defend for anyone that be play clash royale it be sooorta like that except this come first i will also bring up how in singleplayer bloon game you have access to every tower you have unlock but in battle the battle last an hour at most so you can only use 3 of your unlock tower and one more random tower this can bring up some interesting combination let you experiment on which one work best many of you may know that there be a mobile version for this game while you probably can not take this version around with you depend on what kind of computer you have this version framerate be much well than the mobile version and due to the use of a mouse and high definition graphic you can place tower in more precise location in the end i do not really have many problem with this game it be a solid multiplayer tower defense however certain function be block by a paywall so look out for that,pos
925,early access reviewpersonally i do love the game but they decide to run everyone off by do the dumbestpossible with the late update for example i now have an assload of credit that can not be spend on anything in the game all of my stat be completely wipe leave me have to start over stat wise and i think the most change be that you can not complete chalange without buy a new type of currancy that can not be earn in game leave you force to spend money on t just to complete chalange you tencent you right in the eye with a goddamn chainsaw,neg

929,this game have turn i actuallysomethe out this morning that be lessthan this game true story the game be essentially a ploy to get you to pay them money free research point can not be use unless you have eagle to convert them into usable research point and of course eagles cost money you can happily play through the first tier of plane for each region relatively easily however as the tier progress the goal and upgrade become harder and hard to obtain especially on free to play and thus push you towards get a premium account or pay for game currency when i first start play the game it certainly do not have such an obvious push for cash but as the update have roll on it be show it be money grab side money aside the game be relatively good the arcade mode be most people favourite with realism lower and more emphasis on action there be however two other online mode real battle and simulation the game also offer a single player mode and campaign the gameplay itself have be simplify and allow for control almost entirely through a mouse there be a vast array of aircraft for several different region all of which can be upgrade and to a limited extent customise overtime there be also a multitude of map most contain land sea unit which have to be eliminate along with airfield and basis for more information read a well review than this one,neg

936,the game itself be great however when purchase with gem or real money be careful as you may not receive what you pay for and the customer service will not beleive you if you be play on a steam account as they can not see everything that you do and they will say you receive it even with screen shot,neg
937,i think it be a very good game it contain the heartstone feel but get even more mechanic the only downside i could find very fast be that if you want to continue the story you have to cash out in my opinion quite allot for so little it be fair that they take payment for more content but i think it be very expensive if you do not like to play against player this be not for you i think but if you do like that then you should try this out also the voice actin be pretty bad especialy in the pay story line for example the storyteller voice have change pls fix bethesda so all in all a very good game that be similar to heartstone but it be a bit expensive when it come to additional content booster pack story line,pos
938,early access reviewthis game be definitely worth a try for anyone who enjoy counter strike cod4 or any similar old time shooter honesty do not expect much from a f2p but i have be pleasantly suprised with this game there be absolutely no pay to win feature unless for some reason you consider cosmetic pay to win the map be small but balanced to those complain about sniper the map be clearly split into different area with different lane there be a cross map lane for sniper and usually along the left and right hand side of the map there be a cqc or rifle range area for those who do not enjoy snipe the game be extremely fast paced and the match be not long so it be a pretty relaxed enjoyable game to play,pos

943,early access reviewalright so this game start off as kinda like a pubg ripoff but with its own unique twist and not just some blatant copy as time grow on it start to establish itself as a new and different battle royale but yet retain the core fundemental gameplay as all the other it force you to be tactical and a quick mover without get catch up in looting while also loot enough so you good stand a chance in a firefight i love this game for its unique twist on the battle royale genre where most game be almost exact copy of each other i have never really be one to have a preference over fortnite or pubg i enjoy both and play them quite a bit at least 40 hour for each i do not neccesarily like how noticeable it be that this game beneath all its beauty be just another pubg copy it be not enough to make me leave just enough to make me a little irritated but you could the same to any battle royale game that out after pubg or fortnite or even h1z1 but it be the point when the battle pass oh sorry i mean the adventure pass again its kinda bound to happen to any battle royale game but i do not like how it borrow stuff from game and sorta turn it into its own the graphic remind me of pubg but seriously the new player skin and the pass just kinda seem like a total ripoff of fortnite now it will not stop me from play it and i hope it will not stop you from play either but its just something to be aware of its a good game and otherwise a great battle royale game,pos

963,this game be absurdly biased towards the russian vehicle i would not recommend it to anyone base on the fact that the developer will not admit that and choose to cite sekret russian dokument as the reason why russian vehicle be so absurdly op a prime example be the new tu 4 a russian copy of the american b 29 with large engine cannon and payload capacity but be be impossible to shoot down compare to the b 29 which can be shoot down simply by look at it instead of remove the bias from the tu 4 they bump it up to a 7 0 br from a 6 3 br this do absolutely nothing as the game horrible match make as of late will still put the 7 0 tu 4 against the 6 3 b 29 which may as well be make of card stock do not play this game unless you want to play russian vehicle and be hate by everyone you will get addicted and angry and be post a review of why people should not play this game,neg

972,early access reviewso i have to change my original review right now i be not recommend a game that be once great the problem epic loot really like if i want to have more piece to keep build i either have to pla a match to get las 20 random piece which where no the one i need or i can sell the one i already have like wait be not i go to use those piece to build if you get to be in the first position at the end of the match great for you hey you get a rare loot but what about tge people who do not care for the first place and just want to have some fun so this be just my opinion i will say good bye to robocraft for a while have fun guy just get rid of it back to war thunder,neg
973,early access reviewthis game be not fun take 10 min to find a gunit also install the gaijin agent without permission and it seed without permisson scummy and annoying to uninstall p s you can not uninstall the agent by uninstalle the game you have to manually delete it from regedit and file,neg
974,i get this game with a friend because we be bore and i be not disappoint it be true it be not a perfect game but it be free atleast pro this game be fun when you play with friend or alone survival open world if you want to challenge yourself more open world be more pvp base because you can find at the start of the game a lot of gun and hunger thirst bar degenerate at a super slow rate in comparison with survival mode the map be big i only play two caliwood and colorado i do not know if there be more map caliwood be just a city buty it be a decently big map on which you can play on tip if you do not want to get kill get on less populated server common sense duhhh i recommend play survival first so you can get use to conserve ammo and food also you can learn the map colorado or caliwood depend what you be play and you can learn about some exist item in the game too in open world you can find item way more easily rather than in survival mode con bad map make just be careful where you walk i get stick in a bus once if you get stick just get something to kill yourself with a grenade or something almost non existent character customization depend if you care about look or not there be a few glitch or bug here and there but i do not mind them because they do not ruin the gameplay they be actually kind of funny xd clan can be make only on open world and also they set up only for the specific character you have select and it kind of suck friend too but that only when inside a server you can not make lobby so that you and your friend spawn in the same area load time take a long time like 15 second it spawn you in the game before you join the server so you may join already dead if you do not disconnect in a good spot,pos

980,as far as clicker game go this one be absolutely garbage the pace of progression be slow and awkward the variety of foe be minimal at good for whatever reason you can customise your character and have it stand on the side of the screen for no real reason other than aesthetic value which the game already lack with the trashy interface of a constantly glitchy and unintuitive upgrade menu give this a miss,neg

1001,early access reviewi have wait long enough to review this and with the release of the new card set i feel i can finally do so with accuracy to put it simply this game have promise but right now it be just too imbalanced to be truly enjoyable a ranked game get you match against almost the exact same one or two deck over and over i be look at you rakano armory because everyone know they have the strong combination of card and if you be not play those like everyone else you mostly just lose with the occasional lucky win due to power and removal draw if you be just look for something to play casually and pass the time for 5 10 minute by all mean go for it but do not get too into it until the game have have some more development and polish it at least play like a true free to play game with lot of reward so there be that,neg
1002,this be pretty awesome i be no full time fps fanatic infact i think this be my first game of this type of pvp shooter and i be hook i would not like to go in this game alone as it be massive and i still get to grip with everthing but its such good fun and i be already get my fair share of kill that be work with another more experienced player the different type of character you can play be awesome which give the game such variety i be enjoy the medic for level but i be actually enjoy him and get kill with my new gun also the max take on pretty much anyone and anything even at lowish level not sure about the community have not be in a squad yet have not be harrase by anyone verbally but as any be your go to get your fair share of idiot highly recommend great fun,pos

1005,early access reviewi absolutely can not recommend this game the developer be beyond incompetent adventure quest 3d be a perpetually unfinished mmo despite multiple update with add class area item etc the game still only have one town which would be fine if that town be actually complete it be not not even close and with recent news that they be re develop the combat system i be convince they will never finish it they have no interest in provide a complete experience only flash shiny bauble in your face to distract you from the half complete game they expect you to want to pay for,neg

1008,early access reviewnow i be very hopeful go into this knowing full well that it be a very early access copy adventure quest world be one of the more entertaining browser game i ever get to play as a child and i be very curious to see just how that would translate into a modern 3d image as a whole however i still find myself disappointed just not for the reason you would think i the combat and the controls1 the combat i personally have no quarrel with the control or the combat style of the game keep in mind that the game design be true cross platform if i have to comment on it it be not a very good idea to have everything limit as though it be a mobile only game what do this mean well the hud be exactly what you think it be four to five button on the bottom right corner detail your different abilite of which there be really only four for every class as the fifth button be your auto attack and your health and mana bar both of which seem very insignificant as unless you be head into very high level territory there really be not anything that can pose a threat to you not to mention it seem next to impossible to run out of mana unless you be fight a boss mob as someone who be play on pc it be not that i be expect ton more from a game that be program to work on a cell phone however it still feel like artix particularly focus on the mobile aspect now i can only imagine this will change in the future when the dev have have more time to properly work on the game for now however it feel like the only thing that be keep personal computer user in mind be the fact that there be a controll scheme set up for them speak of which 2 the control again i have no major complaint here save for the fact that they be far too simplistic for a game like aq i do expect more than just click to interact and press a button to attack at least outside of their 2d game which even then have more interactive capability than this this be another case of the game be too one sided towards the ios side of the target audience i still think that there will be improvement and it would be unfair of me to not give the developer time to do so however it be still upsetting that it feel like the game be release into beta far too early give that they desire to capture the attention of two separate user let us take a look at some other aspect of the game yes ii the graphicsagain definitely one sided towards mobile user but and a big one too there be no deny that this be almost a necesity i definitely do not find myself complain too much as adavanced graphic for pc user be something that can be integrate in the future like just about everything else that need to be add to the game it be art style be simplistic but still remind me of the aq universe i explore when i be young there really be not anything more i can say about this section really next iii the world itselfhow can i put this gently it be empty like completely empty and almost entirely devoid of npc character that be design to be interact with in battleon the main town in the game that aq be know for i find more hostile npc than anyone to talk to it seem they have many area for the game already design but they have yet to fill them with character that either give you quest to which there be at least one per area shop of which there be next to none especially for low level character that often depend on at least one or two buy so they can last long enough to get armor from grind something rather redundant as the first shop that actually have any of this only sell thing that you can very easily grind for and overall life to the region itself battleon be a town that look like it be abandon in preparation for a full scale war oh do i not mention that all the non hostile npc in the town be just generic guard that can not be interact with i be start to ramble next section iv questsfor a game call adventure quest there really be not that many quest every single one i run into be either a fetch mission or a kill this many of this enemy mission both of which be flaw in a few way fetch mission can be complete far too easily as the item need be literally point out to you meanwhile hunter quest be just the opposite kill this many of that monster okay where be the monster that be it how be i suppose to find it if i do not even know where it be the fact that i run into this exact same predicament at least five time before even end an hour not too good again and i can not really stress this out enough the game be in an extremely early access build so i can not really say i be entirely dissappointed as there really be not much to expect in the first place v conclusionoh we be at the end already that be fast anyway despite all that i have negatively mention i like the way that this game be head i really do think it have potential and i can not truly blame the developer for any of it my final conclusion be that the game be release into its public testing phase far too early essentially there be not really anything to test yet as you can most likely read on the top of this review i have not even play for a full hour and yet i feel like i have already do everything the game currently have available to do artix entertainment have once manage to capture my young feeble heart with the majestic browser game know as adventure quest world even if i do not know what i be do there be enough in it to keep me at least guess what i have to do i would argure that for mobile the game would feel more complete be it not for the fact that i have play full scale mmorpg game in the past on my phone that feel far more diverse than this if i have one suggestion to make to artix it be this do not be afraid to add on to the game right now i have everything on maximum and my computer do not know what be happen as it have never run a game so smoothly before the game be not in the least bit finish much less finished enough for stress testing there be literally nothing to test here guy vi final verdictdo i recommend the game no at least not yet i recommend that you keep an eye on the game and the progress of it be development as i know for a fact that artix be a company if you can really call it that give how few of them there be that like to trully cater to its audience and try their very good to help them out wherever they can but right now the game be not worth playin unless you be test the mobile aspect of it,neg

1046,i recommend this game to people willing to try it yes there be a pay to play system however if you try the core game itself you will like it alot i think it be go to be stupid just hunt mule deer but sure enough i love the game and everything about it needless to say it be a good game,pos

1049,anyone who want to feel the thrill of fighter jet and bomber you can not miss this this be as hardcore of a simulation you can get you need to really learn the plane well most of them at least in order to fly them well and use them in mission you need to know that you need to arm your laser and target pod before you can blowup you need to know how to work the radio when contact jtac or atc want to drive a tank instead go right ahead just pick up the correct dlc first i have hear poeple complain about the price of the dlc well yes they cost as much as a new game but you know what they be new game these plane be incredibly detailed if you want the real deal the real feel do not miss this title,pos
1050,early access reviewi want to reccommend this game i really do sad thing be the server be all locate in russia so my lag be really really bad if they add server like asian one i would probably enjoy this game more the graphic be fine and i really see the potential for this to be a great f2p unless they make it a game you should buy which i be not sure about if and maybe if the developer fix some thing like the ugh text buy menu get a well anticheat maybe i want to be able to play this again in the future perhaps when they fully release it or rather when they fix most of it add more server put a ping checker i want to believe i really do,neg
1051,compare to the majority of previous attemp at make this game what it could of be i believe it have hit close to home have beginner server where it feel like the pvp be equally match as well as a place where new player can experience the overly do amount of loot be great as when you hop on an official server that have high population there be no doubt that you will be pop in moment by a sniper depend on where you be that be a downfall but the majority of the time this can be avoid by just carefully select a server the game mode battle royale be great fun but it feel like a heavy waste of time if you reach the top 10 and do not come in the top 3 i find that i reach the top 10 in a good amount of game only to die before get to the top 3 as people with heavy amount of med can sit in the radiation zone longer when the safezone circle be tiny so they can easily pick you off the pvp server be good if you have already gather a mighty stash worth of gun that you really do not care about lose a lot of game time till these server become viable i believe the warmup server helpful as you do not lose your gear but you do lose your consumable so you need to bring a whole lot of meds ammo for a gamemode where you achieve nothing but warm up overall this type of game be still toxic but a lot well than the previous one and it do seem like it be head in the right direction there be bad part but good counter part,pos
1052,early access reviewthink a massive problem with this game be that the bonus card stick too much they inhance a card too much without be denyable by silence or card change etc it be not display properly in the beginning and it be a poor mechanic anyway,neg

1055,early access reviewfor starter yes this game be obviously inspire by minecraft as be many other however everything the developer pull off they pull off just right i stop play mc a couple year ago but think i would give this a try it be a suprisingly fresh take on the voxel sandbox style world game that keep come out they take all the good thing people like about mc improve and expand on them whilst remove the feature i do not think most people be ever really fond of in mc overall it be a great game i would easily recommend it and be excited to see what the developer do with this great game,pos
1056,early access reviewbrawlhalla be a fine game it have a small handful of issue but most of them be pretty minor and not worth mention the only one that i feel like actually talk about be how similar the character be one charatcer with a gun weapon feel almost identical to another character with a gun weapon however this issue be not really to big anymore since they have be add more unique move to each character if you want a good 2d brawler i would highly recommend this game,pos

1059,early access reviewat first i be hype up but then later i notice the same boring old t that you would typicaly see in the 2d version of the game if you want a cool weapon or armour set get ready to pay with real money because all the cool item require special coin that yes you guess it you have to pay for however to be fair if you ignore the fact that the cool item and armour set require real money the game be kinda fun,neg
1060,early access reviewalmost 10hrs in and it feel so damn good pro fast response time with key input smooth shooting mechanic clean map design great weapon design it be easy to see the difference between the weaponry cool look vehicle balanced class system no real advantage in choose a class over another just a different move ability with different inventory space end game really engaging and different from other brs con optimization could be well on a 1080 and i7 6700 the game struggle to keep 60fps pickaxe class could use a little boost in speed when climb a rock wall climbing make you slow and vulnerable 3d sound design could be improve sometimes it be hard to tell where you be get shoot from 8 10 so far con be not big enough to penalize the game ring of elysium be fully enjoyable fun and can be also competitive i recommend it and the price tag of zero money make it easy to be access by everybody,pos

1066,very very good design i feel tho if they have charge something like 20 bux and have severely limit the pay to win aspect they would have do better at least reputation wise however when it first come out i maxe out my level and come about 70 the max dps with just good grinding from there on its very steep pay to win or be have not play in some time bc of that good game tho i would say it should be redone well graphic new more engaging world and a well loot structure less pay to win,pos
1067,its battle size put battlefield game to shame its a great mmo shooter and anyone who say its p2w well its understandable sure it look very pay to win but the fact be every weapon you can unlock be a side grade to the default one each unlockable weapon be well at one thing than the start weapon like close quater combat or long range combat but none of the unlockable weapon can play greatly in every situation like the start weapon the vanu start lmg the orion be more than enough proofide say deffinetly give this game a try if you have get the space for it on your computer its free so there s nuthing to lose by give it a go its alot of fun be in these massive battle once you know what your do but if your new prepare to die alot,pos

1106,early access revieweternal manage to be a great compromise between the accessibility and digital interface of hearthstone and the complexity and deckbuilding of magic while the game do not manage to avoid the grinding issue hearthstone have primarily due to expensive deck define legendarie it be pretty generous with give out free stuff in the form of gold and pack the digital nature of the game be exploit wonderfully in mechanic that could never work in a physical card game like magic and way that would probably be too complex for hearthstone which tend to use its digital nature mainly to produce rng effect overall eternal be a great card game with a lot of competitive promise though currently hold back a little by the limited pool of card available oh and if my 20 attack creature could stop take half a year to finish it be attack animation that would be great too,pos
1107,well since i write my review they have add ridiculous amount of garbage to the game they definitely have brainstorming session for how to come up with new item and even category of item to add to the game this way they can sell you a new card tab and an essence tab etc they have lose sight of what make the game good it go from a game with the good loot to one of the bad 99 of item that drop be now garbage it be bad enough that they expect people to buy more and more tab to deal with their hyper inflation of item type and category but they do not even care that we also have to sort all this junk do they realize that they be make the game tedious even if i be filthy rich and i could buy 10 000 tab why would i want to sort that many item this utter disrespect for the time of their customer just so they can make as much money as possible have earn them this negative review strawberry field forever because greed original review several year ago the true diablo 2 because it understand the good part of diablo 2 how to make the powerful armor weapon feel distinct and their effectiveness and useability unique and not just different numerical value amazing game until you reach end game then you start to see how the free to play model do actually influence gameplay design and how the player be expect to become a gambler and hoarder to continue enjoy the game inventory space however the game be free and the skill system give you hundred thousand of hour of nerd or ga sm ic do not censor this volvo because that make it unintelligible experimentation with new character so i must recommend it,neg

1121,early access reviewi see weapon of mass gaming play this and figure i would try it at first grind gauntlet be fun and rewarding but after a few successful run the game just stop i be now in diamond the penultimate rank and it be nigh impossible to get three win in a row the way the difficulty be set up be ambiguous and highly nebulous and it seem like you essentially just get all of your f2p reward a few hour in the game wantsnay need you to play pvp this be because the modern developer think pvp be content it be not pvp be either fluff or the sole purpose of the game the most helpful suggestion on the internet seem to be play draft play draft and play more draft the ai will very frequently curve perfectly and always have a fully functional deck even in forge vs ai mini draft meaning you be always at a distinct disadvantage the algorithm for shuffling be dubious at best many many player have state that they will be either flood or screw for obscene length of time and i can attest to this even with only twelve or so hour at the time of this review it be not too uncommon to draw 12 of your 25 power in a row and sometimes for 2 game in a row the fix deck size and power requirement force this outcome and try to combat it with draw effect seem to make it worse generally speak eternal be f2p do allow you to farm ai but really it be just so rigid and laughably inbalanced that it do not matter for example my first legendary be a 4 4 relic weapon for 4 that make 4 random 1 cost thing when it be destroy that sound awful and random funi will repeat random okay do not equal fun you will see some common and be dumbfound as to why they be not legendarie then you look at the conversion rate for craft and see that it be mostly arbitrary and you be just waste your time once you hit those milestone you be look at hope to get that one free common after 3 win and it will be worth one shardstone how much do it take to craft a common fifty 50 why the difficulty spike suddenly and never abate you initially be afford two loss before the run be over but at a seemingly random point it become one and do since the wooden chest only cough up 25 gold in their death throe and start a forge for your chance at a rare or two be 2 500 gold you will be hammer your left click to get through a lot of menu for quite some time but hey if you want to just jump into rank with a starter deck and ignore the literal concept of fun you may get a little bit ahead of where i be right now oh and daily be just more beg you to play pvp they will just stop let you cheat by play ai you filthy non competitive video gamer,neg
1122,this game look good and the gameplay be good too you can play with your friend in the same squad in game up to 4 player i love tank and plane both but love tank more they be fun to play but the problem be the owner of this game hate germans they be buff and make every other country strong but nerfe germans they do not even have 90 mm weapon when a german tank shoot someone the bullet be just get destroy against the target armor but when anyone else shoot germans they be pierce and get most of the crew out of the game and that be not fair unbalanced especially russian tank for f sake,neg

1127,early access reviewthe good bit of mtg and hearthstone with almost all the bad remove infinitely cheap than mtg with a way more generous f2p model give it an edge over hearthstone as well the 5 colour mana system allow a wide range of deck and more deck tuning option than hearthstone rigid class base system the problem of mana flood screw which plague mtg have be minimize by the way the game force a certain number of power card land in your start hand health return to full at the end of turn like in mtg in addition to the fact that the defend player choose how blocker be assign in combat destroy the curvestone problem of brainless 1 drop 2 drop 3 drop deck be overwhelmingly effective the basic game mechanic encourage and reward slow deck with more interesting decision be develop by a great team include legendary mtg pro player luis scott vargas the bad as it currently stand the game do not explain some of the more intricate interaction very well and kind of assume a certain level of mtg knowledge for example if you try chump block a creature with overwhelm aka trample in mtg and deadly aka deathtouch you may be surprised when your 4 health defender only block one of the damage and the rest hit you you can certainly play this game never have touch mtg but you may run into a few moment like these that may feel unfair the starting campaign be a bit of a slog to get through for new player and do not really do the job of a tutorial in that it do not teach about the kind of interaction mention above however the introduction campaign have just be rework and seem to be much more engaging now if you have ever have even a pass interest in mtg or hearthstone you should try out eternal most of the problem that have turn people i know away from other ccgs have be put to rest in this game,pos

1131,at the time of the review i have about 700 hour log on steam version path of exile be a hardcore action rpg with a lot of depth it will most likely take a while to get in to and it be not suit for quite a lot of gamer however this game be absolutely fantastic pro and con can be subjective so i will just point out main point hardcore can be a heaven for hardcore gamer and a nightmare for casual not recommend for your first arpg free to play but not pay to win gggs microtransaction system be very fair almost everything be cosmetic and nothing in microtransaction store give anyone an advantage realistic gritty graphic i personally love the graphic and art style but it be highly subjective music vary from meh to absolute blast from boring lullaby to beautiful symphony sound design be pretty solid good voice act and realistic sound support be great and quick i personally have great time use it game have class however the class only change how your character look and from where he she start from the skill tree character can use any skill or item if they have require stat skill be skill gem that can be sockete in to item ridiculously flexible and huge skill tree you can make thousand or possibly even million of build with the tree provide skill tree consist of little upgrade for example 0 3 life regeneration or 12 more physical damage some people do not like this but those small upgrade stack fast i personally love the freedom of the skill tree game be base on league so there will be different league where you can create a new character and try new thing lot of equipment variance you can find buy or craft item perfect for your build or even multiple one trading be decent but should be work on you either need to yell to chat or use 3rd party website to make trade game have no auction house or player shop in game leveling can be quick or slow depending on build and skill max level be 100 and you can reach level 70 in 10 15 hour the game have 3 difficulty normal cruel and merciless you will move to the next difficulty after complete storyline story currently be compose of 3 act 4th one be come soon and you complete those act in each difficulty this can be very boring since it can feel like the game be repeat the endgame be a map system you can craft mod in to your map to make them fit your build or your need i personally love this system since it offer a lot of variance vary difficulty and different experience the d sync should be fix in the awakening expansion basically you will be off sync from the game and you may in a different position than your character seem to be on your screen this can and probably will cause a lot of death and frustration but should be get fix soon only thing that have really cause me frustration in the game glad to see it go i may have forget some main point overall i think path of exile be a fantastic game by a fantastic company and i recommend it whole heartedly edit now at over 3k total and the atlas of worlds expansion be fantastic,pos

1138,early access reviewafter playing pubg for a year i can definitely recommend this game very smooth br game that have so far the good graphic however it do not compromise performance for the graphic which be obviously a win win you can choose either tpp or fpp like in pubg but it feel like tpp be a smooth experience you also have a choice of three different kit glider snowboard or climber that make the gameplay a tad more funny as you do not rely on vehicle on to travel this game be like a breeze of fresh air no pun intend 9 10,pos

1140,terrible terrible game unfinished cash grab to complete their release on xbox get out while you can honestly it be laggy in city when only 5 people be present for context i have a gtx 970 and i7 4770k so that be all i can vouch for but friend i play with who have well graphic card say it lag for them as well but again that be only ancedotal the content be super lack with the dev have no idea how to balance the skill i be look at you when they patch pvp but it then take 20 min to kill one mob also after that they add in npc into arena which can just one shoot you and totally ruin any aspect of pvp the game be terribly optomize it lack feature that be already out in other region the suposedly new combat system be pretty much the same as in japan with only minor tweak that actually hurt the combat the dev seem to have no idea how their game actually work since the balance patch tend to break more thing than they fix the game be free to play change my review slightly in say that sure go ahead and try even with it be free to play i would not wast my time and thus it still remain a thumb down for me,neg
1141,do not let people turn you away from this game if you really like to race it be a very good simulation but there be some that would say otherwise due to not take the time to get to know the physics model and the fact that the gas pedal have more position than just nothing to floored now that s not to say that this game do not have flaw after all what game these day do not have a flaw here and there the only big flaw for me be that the ai have vastly superiour grip to the player but you can get close with the right amount of tuning and the dev be work on fix that issue right now online race in this game be a real blast in get real mode but first i beg you to log practice time in this mode base on the multiplayer race i have see lately people think that get real mode be go to be like drive a normal car in real life now the problem with that kind of thinking be that the engine on these car be make to go much faster than a normal car that you would drive daily so get real mode take some practice but after you master it it be definately the good mode another thing the dev may add soon be an offline mode which will be great for unexpected time of internet outage since you would still be able to log some track time if you want in short yes this game have some flaw but so do every other game ever develop so if you really like race give this a try i mean its free so you have get nothing to lose except a little bit of time if you do not like the game but would not you have burn that time gaming anyway,pos

1144,  xd here with a brief review of the game elsword and strongly recomend this game to anyone who like adventure socialize talk and trading item also who do not mind spend a few dollar on customise and upgrade the character or character they plan on use later on in the game this game be a side stroll 3d beat em up japanese anime game with real time fight do combo combination while use spell and magic move and skill in your repithior to defeat your enermie you can also use skill point to unlock new skill and new move as you progess through the game and get strong meaning that you and somebody else could have the same character but could fight in totaly different way and set different skill move to manipulate his her character the way they see fit each character have his her storyline of why they be here and their porpose of fighting which you would find out more of if you decide to try this game which i personally think you will not put down when get head and tail of thing i just a few month ago try the game myself and today still play it because there be so many thing in the game that you can do and new thing and great deal and oppertunitie get add to the game on a regular basis plus you can hang out in this game with your friend form party and or group together talk trade socialize in real time go in dungeon together or solo talk and stratigize while fight with your friend in real time or if you got to go or stop play for a while for what ever reason can withdraw from the group party at anytime with the push of a button on your character personal social option plus they start you off with ten resurrection stone and a long bar of life when you first start off and a combo list for your character that you can improve on as you level up and progress though the game at the beginning of the game you can choose the character you want to figh as and that character storyline will begin after you put your personal user name in to identify yourself in the game if it turn out that you do not like that character you could make up to four character or four of the same character in anyway you see fit from the clothe they wear to the way they fight you controll it all or you could chose the character you do not want any more and press delete the game would then ask you be you sure you want to delete the character click yes and the character will be delete no and the character will be spare in my opinion this game be one of the good game i have ever play and be in it for the long hall run they people in this game will get tired of see me and say oh there gos xd again also after customise your character put your move together and learn your skill you can challege your friend and other people online in tournament that give you prise spar session and practice session for fun and to develope your realtime fighting skill that you can level up by appling sp skillpoint that you get when you level up from beat dungeon there be different area to too each with different material you need to craft new weapon amor and clothe you will find out more about this in the game anyways that be some of the basic thing you can do in this game if interested you should give i a try and may end up like the game more than me from xd big fan of elsword,pos

1190,early access reviewi have not be real big into the battle royale craze i play pubg a bit but it be always be riddle with bug and i barely touch fortnite and think the building aspect be a neat twist if a bit gimmicky but i see realm royale and have to give it a shot because it look interesting now i know it be painfully obvious hi rez be always try to jump on the bandwagon but this be actually a really solid albeit need a bit more polish game good point matchmaking be really quick southeast asia where i be locate be a bit slow at about a minute wait but the american server take no time at all the class be really cool and all seem viable they be unique in have access to different ability and legendary weapon the map be wonderfully varied with different biome find loot be always worth it even if the stuff be bad than what you have since you can break them down into shard use for craft at a forge also really addicting to loot and find well armor weapon and ability the forge be great the high quality gear you can find in the world be epic with legendary gear need to be craft at these location use shard and even a player elimination for the class specific legendary weapon the crafting process take time and smoke can be see when a forge be be use so these location can be highly contest as other player will want to take the loot for themselves chicken you turn into a chicken when you be knock out and can run and jump if you be not kill within 30 second of be a chicken you will revive yourself this work even in solo and it be fantastic negative point bit of lag at the beginning of match some weapon need tweak nerfed buff the hunter bow have a ridiculous hit box for example the sound effect be bad the sword swing sound be ridiculously stupid and loud the good song in the game play when you be a chicken but i mute music audio entirely because the game music play for like a minute after land in the world and it make it hard to hear other player general polish need character animation look awkward some float tree etc all in all i be impressed with how fun and addicting this game be it change the formula by be class base involve a little more teamwork in that regard be generous with health armor and most of all by the shard and forge crafting system which be just brilliant oh and no building shenanigan,pos

1192,a very good hack n slash game or diablo like if you want to name it that way that s f2p but not pay to win in any way it become a little grindy in endgame but besides that poe be a fun game that offer a lot of content for literally nothing it may become boring if you be not into create new character to try out build or find explore some area over and over again bore worth at least a playthrough9 10 in my book,pos
1193,early access reviewgreat concept bad community management pathetic communication by the dev team and a laundry list of old bug that should have be correct year ago plague an otherwise cool concept with each update experience grinding get bad and worse extend the gap between rank all in all i can not recommend this title it be get steadily bad instead of well and the dev team seem to be asleep at the wheel,neg
1194,one of the good idle game i have ever play what set this title apart for other in the genre be the currency bonus be not apply all at once or in a linear fashion instead only some bonus from a large pool can be actively combine to suit different play style i e offline online fast or slow session many bonus be secret until unlock this offset the normally repetitive and sometimes bore nature of other idler i have be play for 3 over month and i be still unlock content,pos
1195,for me smite be a history of hate and love it be the good and the bad i do love everything about it aside from server stability and poor skill player mix in matchmaking with veteran all in all i do recommend smite as a pick even for non moba player ps just keep in mind to stay cool,pos

1200,i use like this game at first but 4 year on game be become unenjoyable full of bug when paladin first come out as new class when i be level up my paladin i say to myself wow he be be strong at low level but they nerte paladin bad now as well few other class have be nerte now they remove little scroll icon on arc launch it be use to get zen without spend real money i know there be ad exchange in game to get zen with ad but it too confusing for me i do not like profession the way upgrade thing to upgrade stuff be cost too much,neg
1201,the first thing probably on anyones mind when see the screenshot of this game be a ripoff of minecraft it can be consider that but with almost too many year of experience with minecraft creativerse have a lot of difference it honestly feel a little like a different game the graphic be amazing and the creature roam around be terrifying and adorable all at the same time the gameplay be nothing like i have see before with item such as the extractor and a creative way of obtain item without the use of a shovel axe or pickaxe it can take some time to figure out what to do and go through god know how many task a huge setback for some peep can be the fact that in order to experience even more the game you have to pay around 19 buck or so to upgrade to creativerse pro,pos
1202,a long time ago i would recomend this game but they change it to the point that i no longer enjoy play do not get me wrong the actual game be really fun but the dev ruin it its pay to win practically pay to play the crate system be cool at first then they add the premium almost everytime you get something half decent its in the premium only section everything in the store be super expensive and sell for practically nothing its kind of disgusting how they change all their system so that its more profitable i love this game and i want to play it but everytime i do it show me just why i stop its about that time that i reinstall it check out the new stuff hate the game again and stop play for another 1 2 3 4 of a year i do not know why i keep come back i know they be not go to fix what they have do but i just keep hope and keep be disapointed there s a reason that most people who play from the beggining do not play anymore and those that do only play because they already have all the stuff they need not like they can get it from a crate or the shop,neg
1203,i have play this gem of a game a total of 287 hour before it be available on steam and i could start play it on my steam account i start play smite in open beta i even have a close beta key but stupid me do not start play smite back then because the premise of a moba sound boring i have no idea well smite could be call the non boring moba this be a full action game you play in 3rd person so you can enjoy the beautiful level and the even more beautiful ability effect from a decent angle of view even better be you can enjoy the look of the god and their many awesome skin from up close the gameplay do not lack either once you know how to upgrade ability and when to purchase which item casual play which i prefer but smite have a huge competitive scene with league etc if you prefer that be a lot of fun and will entertain you for many hour especially because you can choose from many different god to play as well as a good selection of different game mode god yes you play god this game do not feature unknown fantasy character with a lame backstory instead you play one of currently january 2016 73 god and some mythical demon and monster like thor freya athena ares isis osiris hercules mercury kali rama kukulkan chaac sun wukong change and recently january 2016 introduce amaterasu as first goddess of the japanese pantheon it be likely that more pantheon will be add in the future the fact that you be an actual god in a battle for the heavens make this game feel more epic than other mobas which be support by the scenery item and music in the game this be a free to play game which have an acceptable in game economy there be no pay to win at all in this game everything you buy for real money be cosmetic from avatar skin voice pack to music or announcer pack all god can be unlock by play other god you get a selection of god for free when start the game and many skin and other item can be unlock by play as well the only thing you could say against smite be that a game can swing to one side a little too quickly however even in the smite world championship we have see interesting turn in a game so the imbalance be perfectly acceptable i can recommend this game even to people who think mobas be bore you will probably be disabuse of this notion like me,pos
1204,this game be pretty trash tbh i think the game like me by give me good role and but after i stop play for a while and get back on the game start give me bad roll and give merng if you want to be good at this game you need to have good rng and i do not know what i be talk about anymore so i give this game 0 10 because my dad beat me everynight,neg

1219,disclaimer the game itself be not inherently bad i do put over 15 hour into it before uninstalle it you have get the mechanic of bloon td 5 couple with a competitive multiplayer aspect however there be many flaw within the game mechanic that simply make it such that i would not tell my friend about it first the game be straight up pay2win bloon td5 be good this be a cash grab the game would be better balanced if they just charge five buck for it and put everyone on equal footing but that be not the case you buy tower unlock which give you an advantage over your opponent you buy energy which give you an advantage over your opponent you buy club access unobtainable by non paying which give you access to more arena with special rule second there be some balance issue do you spend 10 on the newbie starter pack if you do you have enough medallion to buy the cobra tower this tower make it impossible to lose versus player that do not have this tower in defense mode you gain extra life every fifteen second which be sizable in assault mode your opponent lose 2 of their 150 life every fifteen second per cobra tower you have that be to say you will win versus your opponent without have to watch a single bloon go by them buy these tower and upgrade them then wait em out in both assault and defense mode both of the f2p mode this tower also increase your cash income by give you extra money every round if you have it where be the fun in stomp people that do not have it if you do not have it where be the fun in lose a game where the rule do not matter third the meta be very stale at the high rank everyone use the same tower loadout just google bloons td battles chipper farm do you not spend 10 on this because the game be supposedly free many of your match will be fair but if you see a cobra tower on the other side just surrender because you be lose this round not to the rule of the game but rather to teh ultimate tower 11 one your energy replenish at a rate of 5 per hour to a max of 20 be that too slow buy more energy with real monie be the energy cap too low buy an increase energy have a tangible effect on the game most notably by increase the attack speed of all your tower for a short time a la the mib call to arm effect in bloon td 5 be you out of energy and refuse to spend cash on the game your opponent may simply have an advantage over you as they can use this ability and you can not instead of use tower to unlock high tier you use medallion to unlock high tier as your level increase do not feel like use medallion and or wait for your level to get high enough guess what five buck get around all that noise card mode be akin to hearthstone in that whoever have the most sink into it win the detail and mechanic be too esoteric to go into here but it be even bad than the assault defense mode balance to top it all off the game be full of cheater just google bloons td battle hack and click on any of the myriad result to get an example of this tl dr the game would be well if the follow occur strict and immediate punishment for cheater cobra tower remove or rebalance pay money to get these an equal amount of energy give to both player at the start of a match pay money to have more tower level limit equal on both player in a match pay money to max tower,neg

1226,i have be play this game for over a year and i have to say that before i know about dota 2 i never would have think that a game would bring me the great pain i have ever feel really everything about this game be toxic and suck the community be horrible as and so be the matchmaking people pick support hero actually be not able to do their job and instead of buy ward and support the team what they be actually mean to do they go for their ing item first and do not even think about upgrade the courier after minute 3 yeah and it be unnecessary to mention that they sometimes do not buy this courier at all so i be ask myself who in the hellinto their head for them to do such stupid thing it all about teamplay in this game and the game can only be win when every player do his job instead of jerk around and when there be already 4 carry why the do you the last one for pick go for a carry hero too that make no sense while play dota 2 i discover that this game bring out a really dark side of me normally i be a calm and relaxed person but dota 2 force me to go to the limit and for the first time in my young life i realize that i can be toxic and salty like the rest of the too when the game do not go well because my team mate be s again that be why i prefer to play with friend instead of go alone if it be your lucky day you will have a nice team which know how to play and if not then let me say this rip there be no more to say really you will get this cancer gang and the game will be ed up furthermore you will waste more or less 40 minute of your precious time but trust me it will take long way longer trust me and because you be a masochist like me you will not quit this game although you often say to yourself that this will be the last game you have ever play before delete dota 2 no instead of quit the game you will play more and more match you will get mad as hell learn russian and persian for free and this will be a vicious circle you can not get out of it you be trap in this game it be really sad i have try so hard but always end up play when i have some time so here be my advice 1 never play alone when you have just start this game and do not have enough experience yet 2 always have some food and drink preferably alcoholic next to you because play and flaming will burn your energy which you actually need for a win or maybe for more flaming 3 schedule your free time it be not only 40 minute you will spend on this game actually it will be more than this sometimes the whole day be ruin by dota 2 once you start play you can not stop anymore 4 you have to be thick skinned or have nerve of steel there be no other way to endure this community you get it great then i wish you guy lot of joy play dota 2 3,pos

1240,it can be fun for short period with the little money you will get daily enough for a few of the cheap payout game you can play you may win those game too however to rank in a tournament you need to play high cost payout battle this mean you will spend hour and hour save money if you want to try and get into one of those decent payout tournament that be not all though you will spend what little money you have on upgrade tower mean you be back to play the cheap payout game there be so to play in any tournament you need to spend money once you be there expect to lose everytime you can copy exactly what the opponenet do layout boost balloon send etc and still lose very easily very big pay to win game so if you be ok with that or with play a few cheap game per day max then this be ok,neg

1263,this game be fun i do not play it for a long time due to all of the negative review i pop on one saturday when i be bored and get instantly hook i love wwii era aircraft and this game have alot to offer in that area you earn research and in game currency by complete mission against other player on fairly large game map as you progress you unlock well plane and hard map each aircraft have modification and such that you can unlock use research and in game currency as well i have not have any problem with any of the admin yet although i admit that i do not speak in game much unlock plane can be tedious in the high tier but i be still have fun if there be nothing to unlock i would probably not play the game as much as i do each plane must be fly for a while to figure out what it be capable of if you be impatient i can see how you would lose it with some of the plane that be hard to master they can seem useless until you use them the way they be intend to be use and in the right level of play get people to actually pay attention to the objective can be difficult at time and can lead to frustration however when you get in a match with even just a couple of team player on your side it can be a wonderful heroic type experience the scoring in the game definitely do not reflect the effort put into actually pull off a win for instance i can do a bombing run that be successfull and destroy all of the enemy basis as well as several ground target and end up next to last place when the ranked scoring come up at the end of a match the guy who get the most point be the guy who have the most air kill most of the time this often lead to people ignore the objective and rack up a huge score buzz around in the middle of the map dogfighting meanwhile the people actually defendie asset and destroy the enemy objective be leave to do the work and get a much less score i admit sometimes when i need just a bit more research i will ignore the objective and use my good plane to get a huge sick score down plane in the middle with the rest of the monkey so i really can not complain too much the folk do that be probably just do the same thing if you be go to invest in gold eagle real money currency then i recommend that you buy the pack and such when they be on sale i also highly suggest that you use them to buy more crew i run seven crew for each country that be about the max you will ever need the tank be fun too but i play almost exclusively airplane when i get more involved in the tank i will update this review the little bit i have play tank be really fun lastly if you be not comfortable with death around every corner and player that be well than you than i would not bother to install this game there be alot of people that be really good at this game and you will die alot i buy a pack that i already own just for the golden eagles since it be cheap when i redeem it it give me nothing i open a ticket and after an hour or so i get a response the csr be very nice and understand english i ask if i could have the code back so i could give to a friend he say sure and send me the code back as unredeemed i give to my buddy and all be well only reason i be post this be that i see some folk complain about how the customer service stink i do not have a problem with my ticket a long time have pass and i still love this game i still exclusively fly airplane,pos

1276,edit for a disclaimer this game be available for several month before steam release so my playtime here on steam do not nearly reflect the hundred of hour i have play this game since close beta be you look for the good card game out there look no further i have play three different card game and this be the one i stick to i have be play it since close beta back in summer last year and i still enjoy the game which say a lot this be quite an extensive review it be structure as follow first a comparison to other card games hs and gwent then a general pro and contra list and lastly my rating tl dr it be a great game you should give it a try if you like card game or any elder scroll game what set this game apart from other card game let us compare it to the most famous one first hearthstone tesl have a lot less rng so skill and strategic thinking get reward more tesl be way more generous in term of acquire card the story mode be very rewarding and you get rare epic and legendary card while level up your character to level 50 also arena reward be well and run stop at 7 win 7 win can give you up to 4 card pack you can definitely play this game without spend money on it you just have to invest some time of course game mechanic there be the rune system which draw you a card for every 5 health you lose if it be a prophecy card you can play it for free during your opponent turn this keep aggro deck in check and add interaction aside from that there be two board lane in this game which add a lot more complexity to the gameplay since you can not shut down your opponent by play one big guard no hero power while many class in hs be define by their hero power tesl be a lot more flexible in that regard there be 10 class each a combination from 2 of the 5 color attribute but you can play mono color as well if you want to and each class have multiple viable archetype just as an example control mage be a very classic control deck in the color blue and yellow but you can also create a very aggressive action deck in those color and a less aggressive midrange version archer red green have aggro midrange combo and control deck there be a lot of variety the developer be very reactive in term of card balance if a card become too opressive and a single deck dominate the entire meta they usually react to it very fast when do so they have show to have a good hand for it unlike in hs many of the nerfed card remain viable after their nerf card usually do not get nerfe to death laddering be much more pleasing you can not lose rank in tesl which make the whole experience a lot less frustrating also you have to win less match to make it to legend rank since there be only 12 rank and lastly the monthly rank reset be very friendly you get reset to rank 5 if you finish at least rank 4 or high or 9 if you finish at least rank 8 or high recently gwent be release which i play for a few week during close beta so let me adress this as well gwent be a very original game because of its 2 round win system and the abundance of a mana system which truly set it apart from other card game this may be refresh for some player but for me personally it be too far away from traditional card game it feel more like a board game to me because i want interaction between minion in a card game so while tesl be a much more complex and well game in the style of hearthstone gwent be pretty much its own game in addition to that tesl have one very huge advantage over gwent there be already mobile version for the game smartphone version be not release yet but they be expect to be release early summer so that should not take much longer currently the android tablet app also work on phone it be just not optimize for it and menu and stuff be a little tiny on a smartphone screen some general thought on what be good and bad aside from the alreday mention thing good the meta this have to do with the point about the dev be reactive but even without them intervene the meta be usually very diverse in tesl first of all you can win with every archetype but aside from that the meta never really get dominate by one single deck because there be counter to every deck as a result the meta can be very shifty if too many people play a certain deck more people will start to run deck that counter that deck if that counter deck get too popular there be usually another deck that counter it i personally never experience such a lively meta in a cardgame before solo content tesl offer a solo arena mode in which you can draft a deck and play against the ai and you still get some nice reward for it so you do not even have to face human opponent if you do not feel like it additionally the story mode in tesl be the good one i have ever see in a cardgame the campaign be a nice start but the recently add expansion dark brotherhood really take it to the next level unlike those bore hs adventure that you just have to complete to get new card there be actually an interesting story to play through and the level along the way be also create in a very creative way tes lore do you like tes game you will probably recognize a few character in here i think the majority of card be inspire by the elder scroll online but it be definitely not limited to that oh and the menu soundtrack be as good as you would expect it from a tes game monthly card to keep the game fresh the dev add a new monthly card every season some of them be very impactful and shake up the meta other be not anyway it be very nice to see new content that regularly gauntlet mode this new game mode be already announce and should be release very soon the general idea be that there will be certain rule for deck construction you can then enter gauntlet mode with your deck build accord to those rule and face other player your run end after 3 loss so it be somewhat comparable to arena entrence fee should be the same as well bad now this be purely a matter of taste but some people dislike the look of the game i personally like it and it think it fit the general theme of tes game very well also it look much more mature and serious than hs for example still they could add some new gameboard and more song to the soundtrack since you can get tired of those after almost a year of play this game reward for rank mode you receive 1 2 or 3 copy of the monthly card depend on your rank each season rank 9 5 or 1 which be cool but other than that the reward be a little lackluster just a bit of gold and some dust for craft card marketing bethesda have not yet push this game a lot so the playerbase be still fairly limited do not get me wrong there be more than enough player in this game to always find an opponent in less than a minute but many potential player simply do not know about this game yet but it be safe to assume that bethesda will market this game much more as soon as all the mobile version be release so it be probably just a matter of time my final rating a solid 9 10 the game be not perfect but there be not much to improve the ranked reward bother me a little and they could add some stuff to make the game look more interesting and diverse but aside from that it honestly be the good card game i have ever play and it be free to play so go ahead and try it yourself if you have not already enjoy,pos
1277,early access reviewi play this game infrequently and i enjoy it very much whenever i do play it this be one of the best free to play game i have ever play and if you have not play it yet you need to,pos
1278,early access reviewonly thing i do not have a problem be the content overall they do do a good job over the year with a majority of the content but let us be very honest here we get player on this game who be pretty stupid and by that let say like majority have an iq of 5 they do not have anything well to do than just sit around and bash n troll each over over stupid game currency or w e they also lie about a lot of what they do in real life just to make themselves imitate and this apply on aqw as well community be legit cancer so that be one very major downside next some developer make way too many rework devalue the original rare the real veteran spend time to obtain all those year maybe be more creative instead of copy stuff yeah and maybe also not see certain player as special because i can not recall how many ae player on twitter beg the developer for random special rare because they think they be special they need to do this for all ex and current moderator and tester because they end up get an unfair advantage by load rare that will not be remove from their account so the rework and loader be another very major setback now i be speak for everyone on this one big one none of the staff member be able to ever address bot way too many of them yes they be originally on aqw but now i have see a few of them on aq3d now i personally speak with the lead moderator for aq3d regard this once nothing have be do about that and same story for aqw nothing be do after send a email in concern there be far more bot on aqw than aq3d but without anyone deal with the botter on both game give the cheater a big and of course an unfair advantage now these be 3 major reason why i do not recommend this game nor would i recommend the other version this be also why it have go downhill ever since 2012 if the ae staff be to assess and do something about these key point there be a chance i would see hope for ae again it be also why i do not come on both game that often these day lucario original aq player since june 2005 aqw player since beta testing in june 2008 aq3d player since alpha testing in august 2015,neg
1279,this be a head up for return player that be have problem with the 2 stage google authentication system this developer have set up what a nightmare i have have try to get my account verify so i can bypass this system that be not work for me if you be an aged user of the game pre 2014 you will find it very interesting interact with their support centre and the hoop they ask you to jump through it be a great game but unfortunately their support be very ordinary and not user friendly at all,neg
1280,forewordthis document be not a review as much as it be my individual perception and impression of the game the singular goal of this writing be to allow an individual who be unfamiliar with path of exile to rapidly establish an understanding of what this game really be to begin any discussion of this game ask yourself what do i value more a good experience or a good reward be i more experience orient with my gaming or more reward orient if you find yourself to be a reward orient gamer you can stop read now this be an experience orient game for most player in fact path of exile be more likely to kill your character than to reward you this be intend to be a light review so i will compress this message into the follow category game design and experience element gameplay and mechanical element rpg and technical element i have decide against include anything about the path of exile community as it be not directly relate to the game itself game design and experience elementspath of exile be free to play grind to grind action rpg that offer the one of great gaming sandbox for build your own unique gameplay experience it be intend that a player create build and tailor a character to then play the game in real time i offer a break down of these label below storywe can start with the game context the story of the game be as thin as the lore be impenetrable i can explain the story a demonic political figure have exile you to a nightmare so you set off to murder him during your murderous expedition you put down legion of monster zombie and mutant as you get wrap up in the mystery of the nightmare so that be all good the lore be much much hard to explain and piece together path be one of those game that have a simple story and a voluminous lore one can draw comparison to dark soul the challenge of piece the lore together be there for anyone who want it the grindnow let us shift the discussion towards the grind it be time for some raw perception about how this game implement the dungeon crawler there be a few thing inherent to all arpgs cool skill skill system zone instance mad loot tier of enemy powerful boss mob and farming player will be farm in the later level of this game so that they can survive move up to high level the game deserve the grind to grind label but it be not all bad this game provide excellent enemy variety with its affix system and the developer continually introduce more new enemy to the game the affix monster that the game generate provide a challenge to all build as they expose different weakness in your character make no mistake you will be play to kill monster in this game period but it will be engage as each new monster situation will teach you something new about your build buildsi just mention it above and we must speak about it now this idea of a build all character have a build to them the build be a character combination of item link active skill and passive skill the game revolve around make your build efficient fun fast survivable as oppose to slow boring costly and weak this be where the experience orientation i mention above come into play player be in charge of create build play and tailor their character as a project i will offer a simple example of how an item a skill and its passive interact together the experience of pull off a sick build be the only reward that this game will give you f2plastly for this section the game be f2p go download and play it with no financial investment your character will look terrible as you cobble together different item the business model depend on it gameplay and mechanicsmechanicsthis game be clunky there be no hiding that fact path use the angled top down view with the camera glue to your character the player click on the screen to move like many other arpgs diablo series dota series league of legends but it be not as smooth and some people consider it jar the mechanic be decent at best but never below serviceable i find it to be a trivial acclimation but some mechanic nut may hate it some skill be inherently clunki than other but be easy to just not invest in over time character pick up movement skill and movement speed on gear which clear up most of the issue experience early game actionsa build consist of usually one or two primary skill damage dealer summon and one or two secondary skill buff debuff skill movement skill it be totally customizable to whatever you do but the above be what be typical to good solid build you will not have your hand scramble around the keyboard to make the game work player hand will default configuration rest on the top left of the keyboard near wasd and the 1 5 number row segment mechanical challengethe enemy in the game do not demand high mechanical skill to outplay this somewhat change with map speed mod and end game boss but be fairly uncommon in the base game the focus of the game be squarely on its rpg mechanic to win you fight rather than kite and the various form of tank the focus of the game be not about its mechanic but some may find it clunky rpg technical elementswe have arrive at the real focus of the game this section could be many time large than the previous section i need to stress something here that many player do not perceive about path of exile defense this game will absolutely ing murder you and completely neutralize an entire character build if there be imbalance between offensive and defensive investment in active skill passive and gear all player have the game difficulty scale the same way as they progress and at a certain point a build with no defense be render unplayable the issue of un playability be one that be uniquely stressed in this game player can really up the rpg element balance for themselves by not get enough life in their passive tree passive skill treelet us talk about the passive tree i want everyone to know that the passive tree do not matter until a player have an idea let me repeat that it just do not matter for a new player a brand new player fire up path of exile for the first time and set off to beat the game the game happily oblige to this course of action and eventually murder or nearly murder the new player the new player must be unsatisfied with this result for the passive tree to begin to matter the player must have the gear start to turn in their head to begin to have an idea for improvement the idea for improvement become systemic the more the game be play the systemic idea for improvement become a starting point for a build and it be at this point that the passive tree begin to matter the passive tree be not up for interpretation or understanding until a player have an idea for improvement once a player have this idea understand the passive tree be trivial summaryfrom a review standpoint the interplay between the difficulty of the game and passive skill tree understanding be enough to hard carry the entire ensemble of game design mechanic and rpg element to excellence veteran player already have the understanding of all of this the game itself be a hard hitting benchmark for how well they can execute their build path of exile be free to play grind to grind action rpg that offer the one of great gaming sandbox for build your own unique gameplay experience,pos
1281,i be really enjoy the game until i realize a few thing apparently in war thunder a tank can take 5 shell to the engine and still operate a tank gun can take 3 shell and still operate and a tank crew can take an unlimited amount of shell until every last member have be knock out i pelt so many tank with shell that there be no way they should have be able to move even without kill the crew i put 15 shell into 1 tank i do not aim at the same spot twice i would move the cross hair across the tank try to hit every spot and it do not die i think this game go for realism,neg

1296,war thunder be by far the leader in flight simulator out there despite be free to play war thunder have perfect graphical detail with painstakingly model aircraft and now tank to create the ultimate world war two aerial and ground battle experience the user interface be intuitive allow for the use of just mouse and key to control an aircraft or tank however the option of a joystick be there for more experienced player as well as the focus on multiplayer battle gaiijin have also credit the game with a series of single player mission that help earn credit in game whilst the war thunder economy have see rapid change over the last 5 6 patch it have finally be level out to create a gradual but still progressive and entertaining progression system that allow for a long but rewarding levelling system one area that lack the polish that be see in other area of the game be the cooperative multiplayer as this aspect of the game see a confusing friending and squad system that not only be clunky to use but also reduce frame rate substantially and this be a game killer for player that use less powerful pc or laptop conclusively war thunder present itself as a highly successful game with superb graphic gameplay reward and a grow player base as well as the addition of constantly update feature do to its open beta status i highly recommend this game 9 10,pos
1297,team fortress 2 be a fun game and for well or for bad its one that s best experience by put a lot of time into it there be hundred of weapon that have different strength weakness and special effect which mean that a dedicated player will find a lot of enjoyment in playing for a long time and try to collect the good one for their choose class the colorful and humorous style of the game make it a joy to watch and hear as you play and the class base system make teamwork very important all in all it be a very well make and enjoyable multiplayer shooter and its completely free make it a great choice for someone who want to enjoy a video game with their friend that say its not the ideal game for someone who just want to spend a few minute every now and again its expansive item and class system reward time and if there s not much time spend on it its still fun but not as rewarding that say that person should not be too young the violence be not too much of a concern its more graphic than most cartoon slaptstick but not really any more offensive due to its cartoony nature its just silly rather then be graphic or disturbing but play with real people over the internet simply require enough maturity to understand and deal with the fact that people can sometimes be annoying or terrible and though its not a dreadful community of people its not without its bad apple if your child be mature enough to handle the stuff classmate and internet community tend to throw at them there should not be a problem with this game and if not there s always the option to turn off the blood and social element of the game in my opinion team fortress 2 in my opinion be the good game valve ever make the game get update every now and then and with each update many thing be change be good and sometimes bad weapon be update with new statistic and lovable cosmetic be add i really enjoy the diversity and variety of cosmetic each playable character have in the game all i think valve need to do be to just listen to the tf community more often and value their opinion in conclusion i think that this be the good game i have ever play make from valve and i highly recommend this game in future to other player as this be something everyone need to try out once in their life,pos

1321,it be a less pay 2 win and far more balanced version of hearthstone i have spend 15 and have more than half of all the card and it be extremely easy to earn pack in game for free 10 hour into the game and i already have a close to complete meta deck the 2 lane system be a nice addition compare to other card game and it work really well,pos
1322,early access reviewpreviously give a negative review staff respond and i remove it to give them the benefit of the doubt 2 month later include ticket send to the admin with video link proof of hacker yet still no action take this game be not p2w but it be definately a place for fps hacker to play that be unless you be willing to pay for the hack itself doubt i will come back again as black squad have lose my trust in provide a fair and competitive gameplay for player regard melvin,neg
1323,early access reviewthis game be awesome d when i download it i think it be another version of cs go and i will not play it unless 10 min but now i be play the game for hour daily xpi recommend this game for all the shooter lover not only cs go lover note i do not like cs go but i like black squad 3,pos
1324,this game be really fun to play i recommend this game to anyone who like to play game like these may there be some unbalanced item or god or glitch and bug i hope everything will be fix and patch soon,pos
1325,early access reviewexcellent game the progression base gameplay lead to successively faster and more challenging fight feel like play a fast pace deathmatch game in a battle royale setting the dev seem committed to improve the game as long as the server improve game will go far,pos
1326,i have play this game for awhile now 800 hrs yes life waste this game can be pay to win for those people that waste hundred of dollar to get 10 11 for there weapon money be also waste on skill skill page pet mount and costume that be way over price practically 25 just for one costume pve be somewhat repetitive my only focus be pvp for that reason now pvp i recommend you stay away from it its not worth the time to waste to get good this be how practically every match go outplay the opponent the whole match than opponent get one catch gg its over pvp be fill with people that be gear carry especially in the high rank of course one would say just to get gear yourself but than another issue arise which be connection this game connection in pvp be quite horrible i live in the u s i would get match up with people in europe or south america server be bad practically every match be lag heaven i do not mind get destoye by gear carry people and if it be just that issue i would recommend this game but the lag in pvp kill it for me if your willing to deal with the issue this game have than by all mean download it and waste your life on it like i do try to get decent gear in order to not get destroy in pvp by laggy gear carry people if your go to stick to pve than have some friend with you it would make it less boring and make it seem a little less repetitive all in all its somewhat pay to win with decent pve and pvp that would be great if i do not always face someone from a different country,neg
1327,early access reviewthis game be simply childish there be not much to do this game have potential but it be waste if you like the mechanic though everquest have the same mechanic,neg
1328,this game have some real good potential the concept be good since most of ww2 games cost money but h g dosentthe only problem be that developer do not see what they have and they prefeer the money developer dosent even care it would be a good game if they care sorry for grammor,neg
1329,one of my favorite game in my library my play time reflect how much time i have spend appreciate the team work and competitive spirit of the game support who actually support the team carry who can carry the team to victory and player who can execute a base push as timely as the new york sunway by the way i love subway sandwich i eat a blt without the t almost every week bacon be the most delicious meat lettuce be like the cup to the tea party you can not have tea without water and you can not hold water without cup unless of course you use your hand or your mouth but lettuce cup be pretty delicious so imagine the bacon and the lettuce together but without the disgusting creature know as tomato which while they rhyme with potato do not taste anything similar if potato taste like french fry tomato would taste like awful fry wet vegetable speak of wet table if you put water on table it get wet not stuff like multiplication table that be way too complicated what be 6x6 its like 64 or something which be like 10 if you add them all together what do that mean i be not sure math be hard unlike dota2 which be a great game especially as a carry actually i never play carry before it seem like a pretty easy job though just kill thing until you win the game that be a pretty simple job description unlike support or mid or offlane or jungle i mean jungle be a location how be it a job it be more like a forest than a jungle i mean jungle have lion and stuff right forest have angry bear i be not sure where man bird and horse man be from though horse be not jungle creature i think they sound more like mountain creature to be honest i have not see a troll before or a gnoll but i bet they be forest creature as well too so jungle should really be call forest mid be a pretty self explanatory position its the middle of the map lane like if you have 3 lane he would take the second one or she there be female hero as well be they call heroine well i would not want to call anyone a dangerously addicting drug that would be sexist i mean play lina be pretty addicting though fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire its like if you have a charmander and combine it with a jynx that s what lina be which remind me that pokemon recently come out x and y be pretty popular with my friend so i wamt a 3ds those thing cost money though but i head i can trade my item for cash that sound pretty amazing earn money while palying games its like the american dream for people who do not want actual job not that i have a job yet all i do be stay home and read manga which be pronounce mane gah like mango but with an a i sometimes forget myself and add a false accent though and pronounce it mahn gaaaa so offlane be the lane opposite of the safe lane so the dangerous lane as they would call it it be not very safe cause you cross the mystical safety river to fight bad guy its like chinese vampire and run water i do not think they can cross run water many they would have a hard time with modern day plumb one flush of the toilet and the go poof or do they i actually know nothing about chinese vampire i only know vampire from the book my friend lend me it be the twilight saga i really prefer the jacob to the other guy though i be pretty upset when bella make the wrong choice i mean who would not want a guy you could play fetch whenever you want plus the other guy be like 439434 year old yuck so support be the last job you can play not only do you provide moral support because most team do not ever have asupport but you also help buy buy item no one else in their right mind would buy like a slave donkey to carry your item for you he can even be give magical wing for more than his actual buying price why would not i want another donkey instead of one fly one i be pretty sure two donkey be cool than one fly one i mean how would you even catch a flying donkey it could poop from like 60 foot and it would be awful like a divebombe terrible smell equine terror but donkey be pretty cute so keep them on the ground if donkey be mean to fly god would have evolve them wing instead of use magic so that be dota its a pretty good game but it have some problem too after all even blt have ts here be the digusting part of the blt game take a while to finish so if you tend to have sudden gas attack like me you may have an accident while you be play a particular game a game of dota can last from as long as 30 second to 50 hour like i be not even joke how troublesome it be to stay on the toiler for over an house to finish my game of dota i mean look at my avatar that be my face for like the first 5 minute of dota before my leg fall asleep and i start get cramp it also have too many different hero i think the game could cut its hero count down to about 7 it would also encourage fast hero pick if the last 3 player could not choose any hero it be a definitely annoying to choose the tree hero and the enemy hero pick an all fire team and the lumberjack hero you be literally counterpicked because you choose too early it would be well to give some kind of gold option or a repick option some game mode take forever like captain draft can be much short if they remove all the ban sometimes i want to make team electric but then a ban come up and i accidentally ban mr thunder or the masked electric emo then team thunder be ruin i can understand why ban could be good though cause everyone choose fat butcher guy he use his hook to hug you then you smell him to death sometimes he tickle you for extra damage what be bad be that he eat you he get fat and strong the big tomato of the problem be the fact that the game have too much action but not enough story its like bad than dynasty warrior when it come to story i could use a few cutscene tell me why i be team up with a giant spider a porcupine a baby rock and a angel man at least there be a reason in dynasty warrior 7 about why i be fight guan yu with my hated enemy the filthy wu be those filthy wu actually even man the way they fight with their cowardly fire arrow and powerful navy instead of face the numerically and superiorly lead enemy army head on just scream uncultured barbarian so i think i will give the game a 1 10 14 its a pretty good game but the lack of story give it only a 1 in that category i understand that every hero have its own lore but the big connection be quite lost when i team up with my big rival against my good friend a 10 grade for the excellent team spirit of the game people play like man instead of filthy wu woman but ali why the 14 and not a 17 because the game have that huge tomato and i hate tomato i love blt without the t bl be the great invention of man till someone introduce the uncessary t i would have bl everyday if i could afford it but i have no job and spend all my time read manga,pos
1330,early access reviewafter be a magic player for 20 year this be the close there be to a digital competetive well designed and good look tcg it take a while to get immerse but the reward system be much more generous than in any other tcg you can easily get start with a decent deck and improve it over time the monthly event be also great as they cost the same amount of gold to play as if you would just buy the booster you recieve meaning there be no reason at all to not take part and play them the community be also great especially with sharing deck tech and new strategy overall greatly recommend,pos
1331,early access reviewuber pay2win very unbalanced i almost buy premium but now i be glad i do not edit33hrs of gameplay still think it be pretty unbalanced tank plane spawn camper vs team with nothing specially for people just start maybe they try to get new people to get premium early the game be not bad but not worth buy pricy premium item if it would be a one time deal and without shortcut for anyone then i would spend some money but since it be not i would recomend the game to one with deep wallet or ton of free time i do not know either editcomment from r e t ard will be remove,neg
1332,early access reviewmana flood and mana screw ruin this game there be of course mana fixing card and creature that help you ramp but you need to draw them or get lucky and have them in your open hand even after that there be no garuntee you will not just get flood after get your ramp and fix nothing bad than lose a game because you get to 10 power turn 5 or 6 and all you draw be mana for 8 straight turn or your hand be full of 8 drop and you be stick at 2 mana even aggro deck be not immune to flood and screw it be very frustrating,neg
1333,that skill tree be huge but the actual amount of choice be limit some call this game path of life node because if you do not pick a ton of life node chance be you will be a weak leaf unable to resist the slight breeze by the time you get to the third difficulty that say the game do a number of force skill tree reset over the last year and it be a pain to have to restart such a huge build every time then again it be nice to be give the freedom to do so because like many other i completely mess up my build by not hold to the life node rule glass cannon come to mind all in all it be a great game many time better than diablo 3 and free to boot and good of all unlike most f2p game the dev of this game have a strict no pay to win ever rule anything you can buy in this game be decorative extra inventory slot cool special effect and pet totally worth it because the game be fair to all player,pos
1334,from a great game to a money grab i play this game even back in beta and a lot have change from a great idea to this you have to grind for hour just to get a upgrade after that you play for another upgrade without pay for the game its a grinder even though i do not really mind grind this be just stupid,neg
1335,its pretty cool as far as free game go i just wish it let you unlock more thing like class coin for free instead of have to pay real money i like the grindyness of it because its not to hard to grind for new wepon item etc i would play it more if it have some more depth into the menu and the like waaaaaaaaaaaay better on ps4 than it be on computer simply because you do not need to make a glyph account and the control be a bit easy to learn on ps4 it also run extremely smooth on ps4 basicly just get trove on ps4 game rating at the game current status on ps4 7 out of 10 star,pos
1336,a really good strategic card game set in the world of elder scroll fully playable without pay real money but if you really want to get specific hero and card you may have to pay up login reward give you in game currency to buy pack though overall a great card game and if compare to say hearthstone this game have much more to offer in my opinon,pos
1337,this game be just awesome the good mmo i have everyplaye so much thing to do great community have and still have alot of fun on this game its just fill my free time however with all of these good side the game have some extreme lag and memory leak i like the direction that this game be go for with those big update i hope for less lag and well optimazation for a well gaming expierence,pos
1338,this game be a joke right it in suck the ai be agressive as hell they can slam into you even just slightly touch you and you spin outta control you can slam into them and they will not nudge half the veichale picutre when choose do not ewven show up and the handling be disgusting just erase this game,neg
1339,early access reviewthis be a review for the last 7 month as a whole come from 700 hour on g arena and 60 on steam in this review i will focus on 3rd person because that be the way it be originally intend and as such that be what i stick to this game firstly be build on a great engine with solid shooting mechanic no dsync nightmare very generious loot table and just an all around a polished and stable game in the new pioneer server you have a choice between 3 different loadout that be unique and change the way you can approach certain engagement the hang glider with limited backpack space but great to get across swath of land and get on enemy rooftop oh yeah and you can shoot an smg while glide very hand ythe snowboard with medium backpack space great for speed away to zone or down mountain also you can pull sweet trick off by hold jump key before a ramp life formation in the world the third pack be a climbing kit which you can use to scale mountain and also include a zip line motor attachment you will find zip line scatter across the map to traverse it also have the large backpack space avaliable hint you can hold about 75 more wieght by equip a bulletproof vest each pack include a weapon to give you a fighting chance if you spawn next to an enemy which bring us to spawn in game which be grid base choose your location this be a change from most battle royale by not use a parachute mechanic to pick your location this in my opinion if much fast to get in game without the fuss of wait to land a very welcome inclusion when spawn in my friend and i have notice in game lag for a few second nothing major just everyone spawn in and the game catch up but do not let that put you in dispair because overall the game i feel be very well optimize for a beta decent option in menu to customize control and graphic but do not expect alot of visual flair it be serviceable but not to 2018 quality expectation i will take gameplay that be fluid over ray tracing level of eye candy any day though the game play as most battle royale with a few new twist to it such as move zone be govern by ice cold weather call the ymir and will deal damage over time to an increase effect it will cover your screen in ice add to the effect that your in an ice storm your gun will also have ice and snow on them which be a nice attention to detail that i appriciate the end game be where the meat of the game be it be not as stressful as 1v1 in pubg be sometimes because this time you have a helicopter that will land in a designate area that will be mark on the map 4 people can board but that will rarely happen because it will be a sniper hotspot pick off enemy climb the ladder to board the helicopter most of the end game rely on your medkit to last you til you and the last people can not take anymore damage and try to board the heli it be a cat and mouse game and be fun but often repetative because it be less skill and more on who loot more medkit and can wait out the ymir the long overall it fit with the narrative that tencent be push with this game which i feel be a nice change to the regualar br fair you will find bit of story scatter around the map that will tell you what people be do at the time before have to leave after spend the majority of this year play this game i can say it be my favorite battle royale it be refresh it work and have a bright future with dev that be on the ball when it come to push update and feature give it time you will be in for a good run with this game thank you tencent and roe dev,pos

1341,i highly recommend against download this game first off it be microtransaction hell you have to pay for everything the game be also pay to win bad whenever you die you either have to wait a certain amount of time or pay to respawn the game be very buggy and break i have be kill by zombie before i even spawn in and they want me to pay to respawn the damage registry be pathetic i have have several time where i would shoot a player in the head multiple time and they would walk away also the car be extremely broken and laggy someone can get in a car and lag all over the map run everyone over for free the player movement be terrible the character be extremely slow and stamina run out extremely fast it be free to play so it be obviously not go to be great but even on f2p game this be bottom tier,neg
1342,straight pay grind to win what kind of competitive game allow your opponent to have objectively strong tower than you why even have the match when there be a chance it just come down to some guy have grind more than you,neg
1343,this card game be just fantastic easy to learn but hard to master good strategy and tactic require but the learning curve be nice and easy you have a choice to represent a good number of race which have their own deck the single player game be so involve and have so many facet that i just will not bother play another card game not really into play people too many ego problem but there be more than enough in single player to keep you interested art style be nice with voice over element do to perfection the board layout be do well and good of all you do not need to spend a dime to have a lot of fun the only card game you need to play put an arrow in the knee in all the other card game out there outstanding 10 10,pos
1344,well i really enjoy the game the problem i have with it be 1 i really hate cheater i have a lot of game experience so its easy for me to detect a cheater and i have be see cheater in about 30 of the gamesusually aimbot and esp extrasensorial perception for example a plane that be aim consistently against infantry while the fighter should not see the soldier from the air and in the mid game he have 30 infantry killedno matter if you hide in the bush or infantry who be kill everyone without even take coveri think dev be do their good against cheater but i also think its not enought 1 3 of game infest by cheater be too much the other problem i have be 2 the nerfe ptrd 41 it worth nothing i have be able to destroy tank consistently from a range of 5 10 meter but what s the matter to get so close with a very restricted weapon of 1 shoot where you need to hit 3 4 time to destroy a light tank when there you can use antitank grenade wich only take 2 equipment slot while the ptrd take 8 absurd if you shoot from 50 100 meter its almost sure you will miss no matter if you be prone the ptrd 41 be a very long weapon with a very big and heavy ammo so it should have a very decent accuracy but for now this weapon worth nothing in fact the at grenade be a lot more efficient than this supose at rifle 3 what s really the problem with reto moto the problem be that the rich boy that play for america be continuosly complain about this and other weapon and reto moto be so eager to please them that s the reason why americans win almost 90 of the war,neg
1345,i once believe in a great power for good that would help the needy and punish the wicked be it god or any other transcedental being or law all of that be wash away by a few round of this game i can not fathom a world where you go around the field 5 time and stop on the tax spot 4 ing time and lose all your a place where all you friend become money hungry monster who believe that there be such a concept as skill in this game such a thing be almost paradoxical even laughable when face with the roll of the die this be your new god and he be not a benevolent one he can give you all the beach in the world be it dubai cyprus or nice and then take all away with a 11 roll into that piece ofnew york fully boost with the world tour i do not usually write review but i feel compel to warn my fellow man if you wish to stare into the abyss feel the huge expanse of nothingness envelop you as you lose all sense of happiness decency and all other aspect that make a man want to live i recommend that you do it the void be nothing if not heaven compare to soul crush mind numb horror that be business tour online multiplayer board game,neg

1353,it be good for a phone game but it be pointless to play as a pc game because it be nothing more than a waiting simulator if you wanna play in session especially the fact that you have to wait hour before you can start a quest and then another bunch of hour before you can finish it kill it for me,neg
1354,i have honestly be play and have fun on smite for many year now but recently it have become a pain to get on because you get one of three thing that will happen and if your not lvl 30 atleast your guarenteed to deal with it first you deal with toxic plaer who just ruin the experience by screw the match in multiple way second you have people who will just up and leave if they die more than once which screw the match for you most of the time and really start put you off of it and third and finally there be some seriously bad game break bug that make it hard to even want to play it and this be come from a beta player now if you can get a team to play with every match it take out most of the problem but everyone be not always available which make the likelyhood of have to deal with these issue more and more this be my personl opinion after play this game on pc and xbox,neg

1356,to me trove feel like the developer get a few inspiration from minecraft and a few inspiration from terraria and apply this to a common mmo formula with a fair business model that be play to win and pay to look fabulous with decent crafting time and a ton of other stuff of course you get to work for all that you have and want to acquire but still it be very much fair however trove shall not be compare to either of the aforementioned game as trove pose something inherently different and set itself apart with multiple feature or the merging of feature but i be get ahead of myself if you want to skip the lengthy part of my review you may skip to the pro and con i have list below to get us start what about trove lore and story well as far as i be concern there be none a goddess split the world into multiple infinite realm for you to explore venture into slay dangerous foe and collect ton of loot and level up so trove have in my eye the nessecary thing to be an electronic video game provide fun and entertainment also talk with a few community member reveal that most of the player be not too concerned about the lack of lore as trove be almost 100 about gameplay so let us switch to the gameplay trove gameplay have multiple aspect i be go to pick apart one after the other start off with character creation and the character creation in trove be very simple pick one out of 11 possible class at the start of the game and choose a hair style and a race to go with it however hair style and race be purely cosmetic and do neither benefit your character nor do they influence gameplay in any way whatsoever for instance i make a female robot ice sage class character a robotic mage base on ice with a nice female hair style hair and eye colour may also be choose though there be only a few select colour you may choose as a new player you will be most likely concern with the follow building raid dungeon for loot and xp level up and customize your character a little more in term of building there be in every world that be generate and the game throw you in so call cornerstones the cornerstone system work like this it be a plot of land that be 16x16 block in size that you can claim upon claim a basic starter house with basic equipment spawn on your cornerstone you can customize your house any way you want build up to 150 block high for tower enthusiast like me and the stone be the only place apart from club world club be the guild in this game which have their own world that you can shape the way you want it where what you build get save and nobody can grief your stuff as it be protect on your little plot of land and you can switch to another cornerstone which then trigger the buildup of your house there and the wiping of your house from the previous one in essence you get a portable base then there be raid lair there be 3 type of lair small large and recipe lair the latter be use to craft furniture every lair feature a boss in case of the large lair it be 3 boss and every boss drop a chest with loot in it speak loot there be no armour in this game only class skin however the game have weapon mask and hat with unique style base on the biome you have find them in there be 12 biome in total with entirely different theme and you be able to build your house around say theme if you wish to anyway upon get well weapon you may think geez i sure wish i could keep the style of my previous weapon and apply it to my current weapon well you can with the loot collector you can and kinda must build to advance your game experience and collect style for the multiple item upon collect style you get valuable resource but a lot of resource also have to be mine and acquire through drop or the gardening profession and mastery point the mastery rank be a different scale compare to your classs level you have to level each class you get individually get you more mastery point where as your mr mastery rank carry over to your whole game experience what do you do with all the resource craft and build trove feature multiple craft station for multiple profession that either unlock powerful item stylish new block for you to build with and reward you with mastery point upon level up your skill your mr also reward you with stuff such as storage currency stat upgrade that carry over to all of your class and item the profession involve ringcrafte runecrafting gardening fishing and build the latter do not award you mr point however other stuff include but be not limit to mount ally that give passive bonus boat to ride on the sea sail for your boat mag rider another form of mount and much more now switch to the term variety here be some gripe i get about trove the enemy variety be barely present of course every biome have its unique enemy and with unique look and sound but the overall variety in term of attack pattern and ability of say enemy just be not there much basically you will be fight the same enemy over and over again with a different skin save for the shadow realm boss of course which be in more advanced world then the class abilitie each class have four abilitite two of which have to be unlock with progression through level in my opinion this be not enough combat variety but i speak with some community member and it reveal that the majority of player actually do not mind that too much as trove main focus be not combat because to me trove have no main focus so to speak as you can do a myriad of other thing within the game another thing that get me disappoint a bit be the music do not get me wrong the music in itself be fine by me but it be almost never present when you enter a new biome the biome specific music play for a minute then stop for about half an hour and start play again this be not much for such an explorative game like this i dare say what i love about trove be the amount of biome there be and the possibility to style everything even your character with a specific biome in mind as well as the amount of possible block for build your house another thing that i find really neat be the tooltip for almost every item as they in the majority of case reveal how to acquire them you can view all available item in the game in a certain list default press y and check out that stuff and the tooltip for every item almost all of the time tell you how to get them this be pretty neat as it reduce the amount of time i have to ask somebody or look it up in a wiki one last thing the dev they punch out so many update and server maintenance to ensure everybody get a good gaming experience if they notice there be a persistent issue with even a small percentage of player they warn us beforehand and then get right to it by shut down the server and solve the problem in my opinion that be good work but now off to the pro and con pro vast world to explore with a lot of variety in landscape fly hop on a boat or ride your mount ability to style your equip the way you want ability to have your own personal world for yourself a portable base of operation that you can customize the way you want with a variety of different block great development team so far fair business modelcon lack in enemy variety lack in musical presence lack in class ability variety get some resource may get tedious lack of combat varietywould i recommend this game i have a ton of fun with it so far so yes totally and it be free it be not like you be pay anything so give trove a try today,pos
1357,i really like elder scroll legend the play style be familiar enough for old school ccger to jump right in but they have create a great learning curve for new player to cut their tooth on the art for each card be excellent so far the balance in game seem very good some of the story level be difficult and may require several try to defeat but once you figure out how the opponent deck play it be easy to form a strategy to counter i will definitely be play this for a while,pos
1358,early access reviewplease with the result of this br so far hirez have always be good about make quick adjustment to initial balance issue ie new god be op in smite paladin i be a huge fan of no fall damage as it create a more frenetic game pace look forward to see more in the future with classs ability and reward glad to also see them not come out with a bunch of cosmetic and instead get down to improve the game,pos
1359,just an overview really i would score this 7 10 i have this on ipad too pro well flesh out progression system will literally last you forever no need for micro transaction if you do not want them sync with kongregate cloud enable cross device play con literally no sound at all anywhere super repetative can be boring as in the beginning not a lot go on on the screen difficult to see when thing have update,pos
1360,play many hour on the bethesda launcher so my hour play be inaccurate big fan of esl and in my opinion be currently the good ccg at this time it be very similar to hearthstone as many point out but personally feel like it improve on a lot of aspect over hs certainlly more tactical and be less rng base card wise a free story mode with custom deck and choice which reward you with different card one of the strong point in the game and one that i prefer over the solo adventure from hearthstone new story mode be pay for unfortunately but from what i have see these mode be a lot more interactive compare to hs quirky straightforward adventure 50 card and up to 3 copy of non unique card mean more dust soulgem need but only 1200 for legendarie the game be quite generous with it be pack however and reward come quicker and more frequently ie 3 win reward the solo arena along with the multiplayer arena the solo arena be great and feel like an extension of the story mode where you face ai but they tend to have an advantage in various way and have theme deck the lane system be a welcome addition usually there be a standard lane which be a normal lane and a shadow lane where creature basically have stealth against attack except spell and you can not attack across lane this feature mean a lot more strategy be require on creature placement the rune system be something i have mix feeling about on one hand it make the game a lot more tactical and calculate instead of go all face all the time but card draw be not too rewarding which be where prophecy come in for those unaware each player have 5 rune and break for every 5 health increment and each time one be break you get a random card draw prophecy card can be play for free if draw this way it be extremely satisfying get a prophecy but with 50 card minimum deck it be super rng base and be just inconsistent the class system and flexibility with card be a welcome addition a lot of freedom when it come to deck build beautiful and consistent art and design a lot more intricate and mature very similar to mtg artstyle i be write a review to support this game as it deserve more attention and a large playerbase underrate game,pos
1361,i play this game way back when raven be new in the na server the game be very enjoyable but be sadly drown in microtransaction that will effectively make you strong than anyone that be not spend money on the game or p2w i think i would try pick it up again because i use to play it a ton with some friend of mine but i just can not get back into it the community be also pretty childish at time and can be rather rude too tl dr game be good but p2w element and community really ruin the fun,neg
1362,early access revieweternal be great start play in closed beta and have be hook ever since the easy way to describe it would be like fix magic as it have many of the same rule in addition there be ton of sweet new mechanic fun deck to play and a well balanced rank and draft environment well over 100 hour of gameplay already and i expect to play hundred more if you like card game you need to give eternal a try d,pos
1363,early access reviewyet another good mtg clone yet without trade it be worthless if you play 4 free its a fine game when you need to get serious then it definitely will cost you i remember buy my couch by sell my extra mtg card this be not what you invest and have some return of investment,pos
1364,early access reviewi would not recomend this to anyone within the region of asia as they have not make an asia server yet the game be pretty massive with great potential to beat pubg but as it be right now its not even worth the time as someone who be from asia u can only choose 3 type of server right now euus eeuonce they make an asia server i be sure there will be more player base than there be now,neg
1365,early access review40 hour playtime builder review note feel free to skip my backstory and head straight to the pro and con as someone who put a lot of time into minecraft a very similar game and stop play for a while after the project lose my interest creativerse do not really call to me at first after run out of steam for my usual casual multiplayer however i be coax into give it a go it be either that or minecraft and there be only so many time one can redownload minecraft and optifine and get connect texture work with your desire aesthetic before you start to scream regardless of my hesitancy i jump headfirst into a surprisingly pleasant few hour after give myself some time to explore the world fight mechanic power mining building and explore all but one layer of the world i can safely say that creativerse be a step in the right direction for the block sandbox game genre especially where building be concern i will focus on that aspect for my 40 hour playtime review as i primarily craft and build in addition to be a fan of building and game i be also an artist with a background in graphic design if some of this come across as more of an art critique or design note that would be why hope fellow builder find this review helpful pro lot of block to discover and craft all block can be rotate this include furniture lighting etc unlockable craft block be unlock in craft tree via discover and craft no guess the recipe either the recipe be available in your crafting menu as long as you have unlock that particular tree or pick up the recipe in a chest while explore texture be beautifuly detail seriously though check out some of the texture on the wiki from fancy diamond door to subtle obsidian ore they really give it their all in that department that be say i be not comepletely satisfied with the texture and i will explain that in the con section biome be very atmospheric and come with their own ambiance through the audio visual and mechanic the dripping from the cave ceiling really give splunking that extra boost of excitement biome also have their own region specific creature of both docile and hostile variety mistake honestly i feel like make mistake and experiment with building do not put as much of a dent on your mining tool and resource as play around in minecraft survival do there be no pickaxe in creativerse instead you have a glove with different level of mining cell they can be expensive to make but they last a lot long con craft tree texture i love the craft tree the system not the flora i love that craft a block unlock other recipe i do not however like how block of the same recipe class look next to each other wood for example have several block type that i would like to use together as the base of a build wood half slab wood stair wood wall the wood stair be texture in a very high contrast way and be definitely in a different hue than the wood half slab wood half slab use a subtle wood floor texturing while the wood wall have very little texture at all together it look like kind of weird mesh of texture like three different artist on three different project design them and set them side by side not a lot of texture look good next to each other and a lot of block feel over design over textured too high in contrast i have trouble get particular build to work especially when go for a rustic nordic feel obsidian to me be the big letdown i would have like to use it as a dark metal framework for thing but the block be too saturated and edge towards a dark purple instead of a more neutral feel that say the limestone tree have some goregeous block and i really enjoy build with those half slab i think half slab in minecraft be the bane of my existence but surprisingly they do one simple thing that make all the difference in the world comepare to these little bugger minecraft halfslabs stack on top of each other and creativerse half slab do not this go for any other block you attempt to place on a bottom set half slab in creativerse set half slab on the top half of the block space be super easy with the rotate function however not be able to put a halfslab down to fill the gap under a stair or to break up a repetative pattern in the wall be super annoying for build they be basically only good for craft cover the floor and a few decoration touch very few comepared to if they stack what be on fire torch can not catch tree on fire they can not catch wood on fire they can not catch me on fire but my hay roof go down in the blink of an eye why the god be as displeased about the half slab discovery on my roof as i be apparently monster spawn monster spawn be a bit odd in this game i have see rock lobster on time out in 1x1 square in the wall i have see night pigsys fall from the heavens light up the night sky in their blue die fire nearly every hour my friend and i have to play where be the miru in our underground base because somewhere deep in the wall there be a 1x1 open space that a monster or two will spawn in a purr at us until we kill it and seal the hole more of a note than anything if you use too many natural block that have not be craft after be mine there be a chance that monster can spawn in that area my friend and i learn that the hard way after die several time behind closed door during bathroom break you have be warn conclusion all in all i have have fun in creativerse so far both as a builder and as an adventurer there be a lot of build that i want to try in a lot of different biome i have a lot of hope for this game its in early access still and my main complaint be just thing that could build this good game into a great one if you have some time and you have not already give creativerse a shot especially if you be someone who enjoy unlock material and create there be some bug worth note which i have detail seperatedly in the steam discussion board for creativerse but i have a feeling they will be fix in due time hope this be helpful to fellow imaginative mind happy building,pos
1366,early access reviewwhat can i say i really like space ship and world of tank this game bring the concept of wot to a whole new level the ship be nicely balanced and there be minimal grind to it well worth a shoot,pos
1367,very much like diablo 2 gameplay and graphic wise play solo be kinda bore so try to find some friend that you know they can probably improve the game by allow a large fov since i like to see what i be go to face if you eff up your skill you can probably wait for a major update and they will re spec all your character,pos
1368,for the arcade beatem up fnatic elsword be classic 2 5d sidescrolling fight fun with ton of way to play just make sure you be ready to cough up a few dollar to keep look pretty the combat be insanely fun and you can pull off pretty lengthy combos with only slight effort however if you be not willing to pay you will literally be play in your underwear you think your character look cool it will not once the expiration date of your clothe come in not only do it cost money to not look like an idiot you have to pay a ton of money just to get item that you basically need to get ahead in this game and for that reason i have to give this game a negative score no matter how fun it be,neg
1369,early access reviewthe only other br i have enjoy besides realm royale before the developer team absolutely butcher it it feel like a more polished and functional pubg but i will refrain from call it a pubg killer outside of the quirky but enjoyable movement system with snowboard and hang glider no one use the rock climb ability it be essentially what bluehole picture pubg could be once it be truly finish everything just work there be no clunkiness or choppyness vaulting over obstacle will not leave you jump flat against a wall for 3 hop before a vault trigger gun play be night and day difference compare to pubg where sometimes you feel like your bullet disappear in the air it just play and feel like a great shooter which be something that have be lack in the br genre this will definitely remain my main game until cod blackout release and then it will be my alterate br experience hopefully more and more people will give the game a chance despite the publisher i be hesitant to but every single quirk and original feature this game have grow on you quickly and you come to enjoy the game for what it be and not what it may become unlike every other br in existence,pos
1370,9 10 hello diablo iii this game be almost what the diablo iii should have be except this game be free not pay2win evolve and have huge and complex skill tree only one complaint from my side why the hell i have to play 80 of the game with same 2 sword rather than blame game it be fault of my luck but it can still damage enjoyment,pos
1371,rollercoaster of emotion spend much kong hong dollar and cry inside make me realise i have a problem with money my wife leave me because i spend all our money on dice roll you karen,pos
1372,early access reviewimma go with the classic pro combat be fun and easy to pick up mass diversity in weapon character and possible playstyle the game be well balanced awesome community constant update and patch con i would love to be able to set my own video quality the game will run on pretty much anything doe overall excellent even if this be not your thing i really recommend you give it a shot,pos
1373,this game be simply beautiful you can get immerse in it for hour true story there have be time where i think just want to finish this task should not take long then i finish the task and realize it be 4 in the morning there be so many thing to do you will never get bored,pos
1374,it be important to remember that if you take a break from the game for any length of time they wipe your progress which be what happen to me and that pretty much end the game consider it be a pretty solid grind from gun to gun i be not go to start from scratch just because they do not want to keep a few byte of datum remember where i be in the tree i figure it be to encourage people to buy the lifetime access but that be pretty dirty,neg
1375,early access reviewboth magic online and hearthstone would be well game if they be close to eternal it have the depth and complexity of magic and the accesibility and polish of hearthstone,pos
1376,this game be fun until it be a buy to get money and ammo you need gold for ammo and you nee real money for gold s and greed be what it be but i recommend the hunter call of the wild,neg
1377,early access reviewthe game be so nice i do not know why people keep give negative review but there be still alot of bug and the mechanic of this game be so hard overall this game be nice 7 3 10,pos
1378,early access reviewthis game have its own vibe not just a copy of pubg fornite etc the addition to snowboard ziplining glide etc add its very own polish to thing gun fight keep you on your toe you do not just drop in 1 shoot the fight feel much more entertain the graphic be really easy on the eye and seem very smooth overall this be the good early access game i have ever play on top of it its free win win give it a try you will love it,pos
1379,this aton on my phone back in the day do not clock any hour on this pc version but maybe i will someday still it be worth check out especially if you be a fan of the bloon td games or td game in general note there be a fair amount of grind for tower but do not worry eventually youl get there d,pos
1380,early access review18 october 2018 the late patch seem to be more inline with what most player and i wish the return of the class base gameplay more weapon and multiple balance change still far from perfect seem to try to pull this game to a well direction than the patch mention in the wall of text underneat while the patch still have some glitch or bug they seem to be try it to listen to the community feedback and to the fledged player base or at least that be what they want to portray if it be too late to save realm royale we will see at the moment be on the verge of be declare an unnoficial online dead game but seem to start build some traction yet again it be far from be what it be in term of playerwise or balance but be it go somewhere qs ar e still long with sometimes 10 minute q and only 2 region eu na hit registration with projectile weapon seem to behave bad if you be not play on your preffered region even if ping wise it feel the same as before the direction the game seem to go now could change at any moment if hi rez decide that this be not rack on the money or the player base for the moment i will change my review to recommended to try it be not a fully recommend title but if you want a free decent battle royale you can get into it an oppinion from a hardcoring decent realm royale playerone of the few br game i actualy feel good playing it regularly competitvely it be a unique take on battle royale that get under the radar for many gamer but i manage to catch it and get involved while it be not for everyone it be something unique that i really enjoy play the playerbase be not really big but you could get match in a matter of minute if not second the game even be wacky and sometimes unbalanced or have some what the hell happen there still keep me in and want to do play it more i play pubg like a lot but never involve myself in the game the market or the genre like in realm royale it feel close to perfect experience down down by some inconsistency slow develop time and too few class and weapon variety when i wish for variety i never expect that this be how realm royale will become after some controversial unnannounced untested patch go straight to live or to live after 1 day of existance on pts i be skeptical about the development cycle but afterhuge community backlash they kind of modify the patch and remove the issue even if be a bit later than wish while the gameplay becaim a bit stale in the last patch people play meta and the to op engineer at least for squad i still enjoy it and be a blast of fun time and rage time play with the people on discord i still be draw in unfortunately erez ceo of hirez decide that realm royale be bring money and it could do even more if they pull in some player the choice of pull in some people be make in detrimental to all actual and old realm royale player who put money into it and be also detrimental to the complete realm royal formula and to everything the game stand for uniqueness realm royale become a complete different game on pts and now on live one that try to emulate experience from an amalgan of battle royale game that have a big number of player actively while the community complain and try to provide feedback about what be wrong about the patch and how they should bring the old realm royale experience back or at least try to make some adjustment to the game that be as of now now completely different hirez erez decide to push the patch live the patch portray bug from previous version of realm royale and even lack of animation or legendary ability that be or be at the time of writing this break also erez ceo of hirez recently insult a high profile if not the high profile streamer competitive player of realm royale who be commentate in a negative manner about the last patch erez post to the live streamer play the game the way you be suppose to with a team and stop cry the direction of how this game go from an almost overnight sensation to a decent player base and now to a complete mess be abysal while i think that the old game could have be decently present in the market with some change new content drop and event now i be afraid that the game will die before it even get out of early access the console version have be put on hold and the duo or solo in the pc live environment be momentarly a work in progress after it have be pull out of the game in order to make it more competitive queue time be still decent at peak online time when both eu and na population be live but when try to play on eu when eu be on sleep or try to play on na when most of na be away or sleep be almost impossible with que taking plus 10 minute also play from another region only na and eu server have a ping that be competitively innefective especially with the projectile slow weapon eu and na server be the only one remain due to low player number on the other region like south america africa asia and australia even with one que squad but not be in a popular hour will make your wait for match a game who lose a lot of it be playerbase 94 from the time it launch in early access still retain a 3500 active concomitent player count daily now it struggle to maintain half of that tldr realm royale for me and for a lot of player be a game really unique fun enjoyable competitive with few issue in gameplay but some in balance still the developer try to balance the game at much as they could still ignore the comment of the playerbase be still a decent experience now erez ceo of hi rez just say a you to all player and decide to pull out every uniqueness of the game and basically modify the game completely that only look similar to what it be before they try to bring in more people by borrow concept from other game be more casual and easy to play they do not achieve nothing but they manage to drive off their playerbase and attract no one new or at least no one to overpass the big ammount of player that leave realm royale be a sad exemple of a game that be technically decent and have a unique style get destroy by corporate greed not listen to your playerbase and feedback and shell early access as a motivation to bring in the new change realm royale be one of the few game that have to change the entire steam page to reflect the new change and be one of the few game that change it be entire identity in the course of the early access period totalize 3 month at the time of writing while not popular it still have a population that could make this game last for at least 4 5 month more and with an actual drive force it could have become one of the well battle royale game now it be a graveyard hopefully soon someone will get fire for this disaster and they will pull out the sink ship if not it will go deeper and deep in the nothingness of time for what be worth i be happy for the purchase i make in old realm royale i receive cool item a semi interesting battle pass that keep me play and the tought of support the developer of realm royale but i never expect this to happen even if it be an early access i would have never put money in what realm royale be now even if i would have never play the old realm royale,pos
1381,early access reviewi will buy the game at the regular price a lot of the negative review be from butt hurt who be salty typical mmo launch this game be not a genre change event though the combat be niche and hopefully they figure out the action combat system asap,neg
1382,planetside 2 be a tough one to sum up first off you need a decent computer to run this because this game will kill you computer if it can not handle it it be a very cpu and gpu heavy game aside from that it be a joy to play unlike your typical shooter this game do not revolve around quickscoping and lone wolf if you do that in this game it will be a bad expeirience as you constantly die but it be not mean to be play this way a game like this need real co ordination with you squad and your outfit you must know what you be do in this game that s be crutial because this be a massive game with over 6000 people per server every team need to co ordinate the pay to win model be non existant in this game you can play without spend a dime and still kill player who throw down 15 a month for premium membership as for bug yes there be plenty of bug but soe be update this game every month they constantly look at what be wrong so far and try to fix it planetside 2 have the potential to be the top game for the next year or so since its free there be no reason why you shouldt try it note if you be plan to play this game with a medium to low end computer i recommend put the graphic to low and the render quality to 0 to maximize the frame per second,pos
1383,early access reviewthe game be a little unbalanced when i start some wepons be a little over powered such as the proto seeker rail gun tesla and some wepons include building blocke be under power such as the plasma canon sheild laser basic cube but the consept be great you have robot level and every time you level i can not spell up you get 10 cpu which allow you to add extra matereal to your robot and you unlock an item or a set of item the consept of rp robopoint be confusing but the way you earn them and how much you earn be well think out every time you level up you usualy have enough rp to buy the new item sell unwanted item be well thoughout and fairly price and the dynamic movment of the tech you build be well create and handle by the game when the big update on april 28 come out rp be replace with robo bit and all wepon and building block be rebalance perfectly however this be a big however loot crate be a problem as they make robocraft look like other game like war thunder or pixle gun with a reward after fighting and a dayly reward but the main sad thing be that when you level up you do not unlock anything new besides cpu you can purchase everything right off the bat which remove the fealing of accomplishment if it become anything more like other game i will uninstall robocraft at that point its a waste of hard disk space to me i be so sorry but i be worry about the future of this game,neg
1384,world of tank blitz be largely the same as world of tank which can be count as a old brother to blitz gameplay wise be quite similar with the old patch of world of tank physics gun shoot sound armour profile and etc both of them be f2p and grind the top tier 10 tank without any premium tank or premium account be possible as long as one play smart and save credit compare to warthunder blitz fall on the arcade type of game which be much easy to play and master than warthunder due to the more small learning curve although warthunder give a high sense of pleasure after you have fully master it the rather major difference compare to world of tank be the lousy graphic which mean a well frame rate for slow computer also one will note that unlike world of tank blitz do not have artillery or self propel gun because of its small map size fast gameplay and short match time which make implement arty impossible then people will ask will the developer implement artillery into the game next time the answer be no unless they make special match with long match time and big map which i think be not go to happen another point to note be that its fast gameplay make tank with a certain amount of mobility play more aggressively and become able to keep up with the pace of the battle much easy overall if you be look for a quick multiplayer tank game that be easy to play than world of tank then blitz be great for you if you be a hardcore fan of tank and would want to try something much harder then warthunder intermediate skill and f2p steel armour blaze of war high detail and big learning curve same for the other two list along with steel beast and steel fury kharkov 1942 be good game to try with thier high realism here be some tip for people who be start in blitz 1 take a look at the tech tree and see which top tier tank be appeal to you then plan which tank line you would want to take towards that tier 10 tank note that some top tier tank have only one tank line to choose 2 after that i would recommend people grind the russian medium tank line because they be rather easy and fun to play with or you can choose a tank line which have tank with good enough mobility like the be heavy tank line you can also choose not to grind any russian tank if you prefer snipe germany or would rather be a jack of all trade us it be the good to avoid the british tank line because they be one of the hard tank to play in my opinion 3 do not use premium ammunition as in ammo that can be buy for credit but in a very large amount of credit compare to your standard ammo either because they have high penetration against armour or deal more damage against enemy tank unnecessarily but only use it when you can not penetrate the enemy tank with standard ammo and etc also do not buy provison and camouflage for a tank you be use it to grind a hefty amount of credit as the result would most likely be a loss of credit or only a few hundred plus credit even if you have a great battle 4 lastly have fun and do not get angry about a match if ever in a bad mood take a break and play again later this can help you concentrate and perform well in battle 5 do not forget to learn technique to use your tank more effeciently you can find that out with the forum or youtube video world of tank forum and video also apply to blitz,pos
1385,early access reviewthis be not a very good smash bros clone i use to think it be but then i think about how the character be different they be not everything be all the same there be no counter there be no reflect there be no charge move no wind up attack there be very slight difference in the attack but nothing unique i still do not mind play it every now and then but it be lack in so much,pos
1386,early access reviewsimply one of the bad game i have ever play from one of the bad game developer i have ever come across within two day of launch they nerfe all class damage by nearly 50 yet paladins a support class can effectively solo every single other class due to stun lock and self heal which make the entire aspect of class balance a joke they also nerfe exp gain over all so the few lucky people that get to get onto the server within the first two day get to max level on several character while my one mage that get on four day in could only get to lvl 20 25 before quest run out force me to either dungeon grind or grind on mob for hour then they totally destroy one of the only enjoyable thing about mage ice snap see how they be paper and do not do anywhere enough damage for how squishy they be no one really play them anymore and i be p ssed that be the class i use the deluxe edition upgrade on total waste of money for the two dlc upgrade by the way see how everything be lock to one character then of course you have the pepper fiasco where everyone that secretly know about a hidden map with no monster get to go in and farm 8000 pepper to npc them so certain people be rich while everyone that do not know about the cheating zone can barely afford repair and new gear since the dungeon loot rng system be punish trash neowiz refuse to do anything about it so the economy be completely and totally off balance they should have do a hard server reset on at least three separate occasion the pet taming be a cool idea in theory but absolutely atrocious in execution the writing be on the wall with how pay to win the system will be especially if you have look into the other three yes 3 version of this mmo that have be release around the world once the game be out of early access if it get that far they will implement the p2w pet system mark my word it will happen it be just a matter of when then of course you have the p2w gear system where you need to farm gear and dismantle it for part to upgrade your shizz so you can spend a couple month farm dungeon to get the piece or you could just spend real money buy in game currency to buy gear off the auction house and have it in five minute rng be punish before assassin even come out their gear drop in every dungeon see how hard dungeon be after the across the board 50 damage nerf it be extra punishing to get the entire way through a dungeon just to end up with two assassin and one archer gear drop with none of either class be in the party or in game just absolutely atrocious game design on all front and it be never fix in any of the numerous fix of course i forgot to mention the over zealous forum mod that delete ban remove and punish people just try to give honest genuine criticism i have never in my life see a steam forum fill with such terrible power hungry mod that do everything in their power to silence people speak out about the game coffee be a prime example of be an absolutely abysmal mod it ban me for share information on the forum about the other version p2w system i be not rude nor insult just simply explain how p2w it be go to get and get ban for it for tell people to avoid it bad form mister coffee this game have not even be out for four month at this point and it be do so poorly it be already at a 67 discount not to mention hemorrhage the majority of it be playerbase that be nearly unheard of for good game to go on such a massive discount so fast that really should be your first clue that the game be flounder at this point it be a sink ship and not worth any amount of money to play avoid this game like the black death early access be really just an excuse to release a poor product see as how this be the fourth and fourth fail version of bless i be one of many people that ask for a refund after 30 hour and do not get one sadly even though many other do with even more play time i be absolutely p ssed i waste money on this trash scam should have do more research rather than be blind by shiny new mmoness 0 10 for bless and neowiz forum mod even at this point them add in the siren race and mystic class will not get me back permanently uninstalle stick to ff14 wow bfa or buy monster hunter world those game be actually worth your money,neg
1387,while i do love this game there be a few problem with it pro fast and fun action especially with teammate the graphic while not groundbreake be pleasing to look at every character be fun to play as and bring something different to the table with ara and rena be my favorate there be a lot of good track in the game con the game will often encourage you to spend some real money on the game thing like costume extend skill slot pet etc game can get grind heavy later on not like maplestory grind heavy but in the very later dungeon you will need to do a few dungeon run before you can move on to the next mission overall i do like this game but i can say the microtransaction can be a turnoff for some if you be interested in try it play the game for a few hour maybe go to lv30 or something and then deside if it be worth invest a few buck update okay take a look at the price and i can say that some of these be insane i think spend around 25 for a single costume set be a bit much then again look at what we be pay unusual,pos
1388,it be fairly new and i have only play about an hour of it but i really enjoy this and i usually do not enjoy trading card style game it be somewhere between mtg hearthstone and gwent it have the 2 color mechanic from mtg lane from gwent polish card forge system and turn grow magicka magicka from heathstone with an engrossing and full singleplayer campaign elder scroll lore its own spin on trading card game and a lot of polish pro free good story so far great card art and sound design a lot of polish the rune system be something i have not see before i love the idea of upgrade card as you get repeat the lane modifier be interesting story choice actually have a tangable effect on the card you be give for your deck not too computer intensive i have a macbook and do not notice any major hiccup each race have a different effect for your deck and pretty much all the race you be able to play in the main series game be represent and be able to be change at will a lot of in game statistic recordingcon not many card so far already have a 5th of the regular set in game transaction up to over 100 usd a lot of animation the art design for the campaign kind of look like those cheap point click adventure with the still image that they add effect to but it work for the game setting menu in game lackluster long loading time may just be my machine fairly lengthly unskippable tutorial it be basically necessary to sign up for a free bethesda account if you do not have one already its the first thing that come up upon start the game overall like i say before i do not usually do not like trading card game i do not like the meta of them of need every card however this one with its thurough optional single player campaign and load of polish really do hook me even though the pitfall of many tcgs be present it be very early so there be not many card i suggest you try it out i be very surprised by this one a lot of potential for this one i really suggest everyone try it,pos
1389,early access reviewdid not exepecte anything from bless online but have be so dissapointed the studio do not even seem to know where they be go third release and still no idea awfull coommunication when you do not even try to explain what you be try to test without a clear way to report bug to give some point of view something be some kind of way pretty wrong when you be tell you be help into a beta and feel like this thing be release because of a stop date even after hour of playing do not find any good point to save too many point this game feel 15years late many bug into the game core can not use skill load texture allow to fall through the floor graphic use lot of ressource for pretty poor result seem they remove many thing just to fake a path to level up many place as mountain be just 100 empty the path finder try to make you go through oppsite faction camp be stick use the emergency reset option to be teleport pretty far away you need a emote ask other player if they have be find or russian japanese player take some note assassin not available to play you can still drop their stuff need to test stat impact hide remove dummy to let people make test military district try to be a pvp game do not give objective as duel an other class of your level when they have the reverse challenge there be a win a duel challenge but feel weird will people just agree to loose will people have to try to challenge unbalanced duel it feel so you do not know where you be lead the game make what you can to be sure people will not enjoy the experience right now the game be a kill thing to level up and be an harrasment for any low opponant you find well if you can outnumber them do it when anger take the lead you do bad thing and you feel dirty making other not enjoy a chance to do something make you get any kind of self satisfaction my bad i do not sorry i guess i be not enough a jerk maybe this part will be fix when there will be many bus of high level of each faction scout road but if i like to imagine that thing can self fix i have a doubt the pvp the purpose sell of this game be just a shame never play a so static game who be try to be dynamic not a good tab target not a good pure action just the bad of the 2 world a pain to target and not reactive for action you want to pvp why not use the battle zone everyone will be set lvl 45 but do not unlock the lvl 45 skill if you be not lvl 45 because it could balance thing the ui be just a shame dishonor to everything that have be do in other game just be able to see if your team mate be around you have to choose to show up health above player and just try to heal the hard way no stamina show sprint dodge action make guardian paladin even more static you will feel more like a aoe dodge deny class remainming stance switch class should be even small population on server do not seem balanced at all almost feel like 1 10 or more and people can not create your side good luck to explain the difference between create character play character be tell that the founder pack be up for a single character roll on floor so people should not even try multiple class be ready to pay for anything and you still have too much cash there will be cosmetic some very important feature be cash shop tactic be just more than confort but you have to pay for every character need inventory expansion need any confort you will pay for cosmetic later enjoy our way to make you learn you credit card number the feeling of the game right now you use the dungeon team search tool and get a group pay for dungeon teleportation 75 lumena every time you can in game farm 50 lumena per day with an inside mecanic for an insane amount so you pay the game you can pay and month fee and you still have to pay even more for anything electronic art be that you as not even get close to all trouble you exit a dungeon you will be set to the channel 1 in front of the entrance 2 choice your faction be outnumber the place you have to use a pvp disable item anyway even if you use a crowd control immunity to try to run back in 2 m you will be kill because it be just more fun this way i like pvp but when you be push to hunt for anyte low than you there be only shame in the player vs player spirit the adrenaline rush the i can do it no it be just a bus tour stomp tourist you will try to answer it be a beta not a beta it do not worth some fix the main matter be that there be no objective to reach for the dev like a frankenstein creature patch with thing see elsewhere not give the feeling they be master as a part of the game have be remove let us say for a well sight on test the lore be just the too many time see thing the level design be still try to understand what could have be the purpose not a pve mapping not a real pvp strategy with key place to control except maybe dungeon the race choice have some result on party buff available when team you can set buff the available one be a matter of race class in the group but to be direct never feel that race be just so useless not even charimatic some game do not have any race buff but you still feel like be part of something in this case it be just a single race any of the current available one would be enough the story do not care there be some not bad attempt but messia syndrom without any impact feel sad to say but the main story arc be the close thing to level point path all make level a fast but so boring thing and you do not even have to hope it will be build you master of your class the economy model be strange so much control on the auction house consumable be just very expensive to craft so afraid of gold farmer that be just feel lock in padlock bunch without idea of consequence the auction house do not have any stat filter good luck find thing that you could be try to fit for your class people do not want to rise a crafting skill at least they can collect ressource and sell them but in the end consumable be pretty expensive potion can be very usefull they be quite insane powerfull but it cost 2 kidney to keep a good stock up if not alchemist spirit be very very very powerfull upgrade but you may loose them on death so you should stack plenty be ready to spend a lot of money the last and one that can change the most in next day may be the gameplay start with a dynamic but 2 shot fight endgame to a static annoying game not plan to be very pve proof here the matter be that be just insane strong unexpected and may have need more explanation come on some dungeon be almost not possible to do because people do not know how to take the path the dev want to try for that point i have a doubt about that dev team have a plan strategy some huge matter have be solve such have not have a true multiple attempt to connect with a result of static screan without any idea of what be happen some unbalanced skill have be fix but so much remain last word i hope that many thing will be fix some way that bless online will not be remebere as a full failure 3rd release attempt and still no idea about what it should try to be not because i believe bless online could be a great game but because it feel like people could be less enthusiastic in futur game and i want to believe that some other dev will have some respect for player pay the game pay a month fee kind and you still have to pay for feature,neg

1396,this be a moba game what else could i say about it i be pretty sure you have read a bunch of review upon dota before come to this review get straight to the point that this game be probably worth play if you be interested in face individual across the internet with the probability of be skilled in tactic and strategy these strategy and tactic be accomplish via the vast cast of character within dota each with their own set of ability role most character be not confine to their specificed role and give a wide variety of item that can produce a devastating or riduculous combination that will cripple the enemy team if you be up to play this game let it be discern that how you interact with your teammate be vital in your aim to win the match against the oppose team an example of what i mean would be communication within this game you will not always be pair with individual that you will be on equal footing with however you and the other person that comprise your team will have to compromise to make of what you can to achieve the same goal to win in addition aside how you communicate with another you could gain idea of how to play a certain character plot ingenius tactic and enjoy the sensation of teamwork result from communication leave off on one final note remember that every loss within dota show be a gain via reflection see what have be do wrong or have not be do at all with your comrade and together offer strategy and suggestion for future match do not let the loss of a match get to your head always remain composed and level head,pos

1404,great moba if you be into mobas like league of legends smite hon etc then give this a try it be free and it be damn good first off a warning you be go to suck oh you have some experience with mobas oh in that case you be go to suck and getatmatmatmatmatmatmatmatm dota 2 have a pretty long learning curve load of hero to choose from and heap of item to go along the training system be a precious help and introduce you to the last hit deny shop for item and combine item allow you to play with a few noob friendly not easy and not weak than the other one mind you just not that complicated to master in the early stage of the game hero to get you to feel the game pace from then on you still have a lot to learn everybody can use all hero for free and there be no advantage anyone have over you except their own experience in the game but there be plenty of hero to go around and until you have play them all or play against them at least once you will be feel like a noob when you face one for the first time dota 2 be rather unforgiving when it come to carry you die you lose time experience and gold and you need gold to buy item to allow you to carry not that easy for support either most of them do have the uppoer hand on some carry on the early stage of the game but you need to know them in order to take advantage of that also your ability damage do not really scale all that well to late game where the carry start to shine there be dozen of ward spot jungling trick and control point you need to master every game different lane be pretty unpredictable at dota 2 you can have 2 1 2 but you can have a 1 1 3 a 1 2 2 or if you have some jungler you can have 1 1 1 2 os something like that the game pretty dynamic do check some guide and build they can help you in your first contact with some hero but hey it be dota 2 everythings situational sure there be a few core item on many hero but all in all it all depend on the game you be play and a change can make all the difference again if you be into mobas do try it now,pos
1405,fun game at the start then you realize it have a kind of pay to win and still some bug to work out its okay but i can not reccomend it love the skyrim world that it be set in but its not enough to make up for the poor match make and the un randomness of the card,neg

1407,its a shame the looting be addictive and see a human in the distance give a huge adrenaline rush but that s really all that be good about this game maybe i would enjoy it more if the game do not crash every 15 minute or if there be not gun literally everywhere make killing for loot much less rewarding or if there be some sort of animation for healing so that people could not heal themselves as i be shoot them same thing with riot shield it be ridiculous how much of an advantage those give you when it work it be fun but those time be too few and far inbetween,neg
1408,after play this game for 116 hour i can not recommend this to anyone who be not willing to either spend the 50 euro for all possible overpower card that you acquire only via story quest which cost real money or lose hundred and hundred of time to get enough card to get enough in game shard that allow you to craft good card not the overpowered pay card tho,neg

1413,this be the most money demand game i have ever find basically you spend hour and hour of do the same thing over then the bad part the luck if you wanna get something good do not expect it since everything have to be super rare force people to buy over price package also if your try to buy something that they do not have a pack for good luck the pack range from 10 100 there be very few 10 pack though this game be p2w pay to win since everytime someone buy something in the 100 pack they get something although for those who buy a small pack that have like 1 10 super rare chest your not get anything the good chance you get at get something good be 75 chest i would not recommend this game since it demand so much time and work put in to it do the same thing over and over now every few week the dev add another new item or pack that have exsclusive item that player want that can only be obtain by buy for anyone that plan on play this just know that you eventually end up buy something and regret it,neg

1441,update june 30 2017 if you be or be a fan of blizzard hearthstone but despise blizzard then this be your light at the end of the tunnel a masterpiece card game that raise the bar for the genre to yet unsurpassed level of excellence truly an ultimate achievement from the guy who bring us the elder scroll all of the lore be in this game the racial element and all of the awesome sauce from the rpgs make it a great experience to play addicting as hell so beware once you start play do not expect to be able to walk away if you have a background in mtg or hearthstone then this will be simple for you to get go and to be able to compete in a short amount of time hero of skyrim have be introduce and it be pretty impressive the only bad thing be that this do not increase the playerbase of the game it still hover between 3k 5k or low depending on offpeak time the reason for this problem be up to the developer to fix hopefully they will find a way to resolve thing and get this game to a pinnacle of glory where it so deserve to be,pos
1442,  this may be one of the best free to play game on smartphone in my opinion and here it be on steam roughly 2 year after the original release with its gameplay be build room and later upgrade them for more resource for your vault somewhat similar to something like clask of clan in that way upgrade room and even rush them do not require nuka cola quantum aka the game premium currency instead room will upgrade the instant you purchase it with the game basic currency cap the mechanic to rush room to get the resource instantly be a great idea and it work well in the game basically rush a room have around a 30 chance of fail and it increase by 10 each time you do it the counter will go back down to 30 if you allow the room to work naturally if the rush fail there will be a disaster in the room ie a fire or a radroach infestation if that s the case the dweller more on them in a second assign to the room will have to douse the flame fight off the radroache for the dweller aspect you must rebuild civilization by allow dweller to become member in your vault each dweller have a set of s p e c i a l skill s for strength p for perception e for endurance c for charisma i for intelligence a for agility and l for luck dweller high in strength can work best in the power generator room which be vital for power your vault dweller high in perception work well in diner which supply food for your vault dweller high in endurance can work well in storage room dweller high in charisma do well with well talk charisma only affect male female converse with someone of the opposite sex which will end up cause the female to become pregnant and after 3 or so hour will birth a new child which he then grow up to become another worker in the vault dweller who have high intelligence will work best in medbay or science lab where they can produce medkit and antiradiation pack dweller high in the agility stat can work well in the water treatment room which supply water to the vault then luck affect the rush mechanic allow the chance of a disaster to go down a little bit strong dweller be also very capable of venture out in the wasteland give a dweller a weapon which help them during radroach infestation or raider invasion will allow the dweller to survive in the wasteland out there he can find cap gun and outfit which will help stat for dweller and return them to the vault combat in the game be simplistic dweller will automatically attack threat and fight fire its your job to heal them though if they will not survive you can assign them to another room so they can flee and survive if they die you have 24 real life hour to revive them with cap which can be handy when you reach 18 dweller you can build the overseer office which allow quest to be unlock quest be like send dweller out into the wasteland except you select 3 which meet the quest requirement i e level and weapon power and you send them to a certain location which can take anywhere from 1 hour or 21 hour in real time to speed this up you can use nuka cola quantum when they arrive at their destination they travel as a group and will fight enemy however combat in quest be very different from regular battle in the vault and it be in my opinion a little hit or miss if dweller walk into a room where there be enemy they be lock into fighting and can not flee i learn that the hard way so if you intend on do quest i strongly advise pack ton of stimpack aside from that combat be a bit deep it be still simplistic but you can tell which dweller should target what enemy and there be a random chance a checkmark crosshair will show up above an enemy which once click pause the game and enter a timing minigame where you must click the crosshair when it be as close to the center as possible do so will give a critical hit that be 5x more powerful than the basic attack quest do however offer a chance to score ton of loot that can be use later in crafting which i myself have not reach yet side note if you have play a fallout game you will most likely recognize a ton of familiar aspect of the game as the game in my opinion stay very faithful to the fallout franchise in term of style and presentation if you enjoy fallout game or free to play game in the style of craft room and ect you will most likely enjoy this game whether it be for steam or smartphone i give it 4 5 star if you do plan on play this game i hope you enjoy it u,pos
1443,fractured space seem to consistently be refer to as a moba and while it technically be it be sort of a stretch two team face off try to capture the other base that be about it so far and be the essence of its moba classification that make it a bit boring especially if the team you end on do not adjust their ship to complement the other that be really the only negative i can see with fractured space which be a rather big deal since it be pretty much the game mode you be go to play the other extra add up to make it a solid f2p game though at 39 99 to unlock all 31 ship be not outrageous and they go on sale for 19 99 from time to time the graphic be excellent and the add battle chatter from your crew add to the immersion although i know million of life be lose to your incompetence everytime i die i recommend fractured space since it be free to play and you have nothing to lose,pos
1444,early access reviewnot play a great deal to be honest the game seem pretty good i like the mechanic and the combat system big issue really be the wait time 10 minute between game be just not acceptable and i can much easily play another moba game that do not make me wait as long between match i can not blame the game for that its obviously a small playerbase but due to this it be kind of an endless loop no player long wait time less player longer wait time,pos
1445,early access reviewthe late update of the game have turn this from okay to terrible before you have different tier in which you be out into match with and very rarely there would be someone from a low tier now everyone use the same base cube the addition of use multiple weapon on the same bot make this less of a tactical game but more of a let see how many different gun i can fit on a bot all freejam seem to care about be how much money they be get from the game the only update that i find useful be some balance change when they remove the cost to repair after a game and the crf it be ironic that freejam jam with the community as they never seem to listen to the community,neg

1489,probably the good ccg out there especially for player on a budget mechanically it be well than hearthstone and it be very generous to player in term of card and pack drop so you do not need to spend hundred of dollar to build a good deck like you do with magic also unlike mtg arena this actually have a good user interface it be a bit slow to start off with five campaign that unlock your five starter deck but from there on it be great first pvp win of the day net you a pack of twelve card one of which will be a rare or legendary and sometimes a promotional card if you miss these you can later craft them for slightly less of the in game resource than a rare between this progression reward and daily quest it be not hard to build up a sizable collection of card fairly quickly and without drop a single real world dollar pound etc,pos

1538,the game be the good in its genre people need to understand the mentality of its gameplay you be not suppose to open and play it for hour its a side game a multi task game a coffee game to spend that 10 minute and look forward for the next day to send more dweller into the wasteland build more facility breed and expand its go to be slow its go to take time but it be worth it because this be your vault with your people some note for new player the game be free but extremely fair you can cheat some premium item without any repercussion i would personally recommend it this be a casual game as you do not need to worry too much if you make some mistake but it have great depth and interesting mechanic to research and improve your vault and make well decision with that be say it not without its flaw the managing of your dweller can become a huge chore later on the ui do not help since it be build for mobile but that be my single complain i wish they make some improvement there but i do not see that happen especially since its exactly the same game everywhere ios android bathesda pc client window 10 and steam version unfortunately for those wonder you can not auto sync your game with the mobile version even though all the platform share the same kind of save file that mean that the game do not support autosync but you can easily manually take your save file and use them in any other platform i play on different platform so i do not yet have a lot of time f to display here but steam have achievement so yay,pos

1546,early access reviewat it be current state i would not recommend this game for anyone but free to play player with a lot of free time if you be a pay customer the legendary card which you can have 4 of in a deck be difficult to collect especially with less free time to play they tout guarantee 3 legendarie for every box 32 pack which be normally all you be go to get it be ridiculous in a game where you need 4 of say legendarie i have purchase quite a few box and rarely have i ever get anything more than that unless you be fine just play one deck for a long time it be an awful system also this game be similar to magic the gathering in it be mana land for resource which do not really translate well in a online card game when i can go 5 game in a row be mana starved play 25 power in a deck plus 4 x of seek power spell that let me find one be equally ridiculous i have play magic for 20 year and never have an issue like that in the physical game hell not even in the online version,neg

1549,  positive amazing game what i have be look for a hunting game be map size smart ai sound bow crossbow rifle shotgun pistol and this game do just that the graphic do a great job aswell for make game hard to spot out negative but there be downside for this game such as you have to purchase alot of thing such as the weapon the clothing and hunting licence somtime the render distance be a little bit annoying soution they can improve this by buy membership for the licence and instead of weapon you have to purche with gun with earn ingame currency such as gms instead only of ems i think alot would agree that would be a well idea through do mission or tag enough game for gms maybe the score of the buck can calculate towards earn gms such as 100 score buck will earn you 10 gms i do not know it be my idea and still should be able to buy gun with real money for a quick shortcut but a progression system through buy gun would be good and not so many would complain also it would be good if there be a option to increase render distance because sit 150 meter away i can see game sit at a river bank and i zoom in there be tall grass there and when i zoom out there be none if you can get past through all that than this be a really good game and i be happy with buy membership and purchase a couple of weapon but it can be costly to some my score my total thought on the game 7 10 great simulator just need work on the gms system and render distance,pos

1556,i young friend of mine beg me to install this so i give it a go it be terrible right from the start with the ear assault garbage music to the incredibly frustrating and unintuitive menu and character selection screen that make you want to turn the thing off immediately here be a little message for the developer if your player select some game mode for me it be tutorial and wish to exit that game mode you should let them do that typically this occur by press esc key to get to a menu in freestyle basketball you will not receive this courtesy if you decide you want out you be go to have to complete that tutorial i somehow know it be go to happen but this be by far the bad gaming experience i have have in year there be plenty of decent free to play game out there this be not one of them,neg
1557,early access reviewfirst off i would like to say that this review be not suppose to be negitive it be suppose to be a reflection of my own experience with the game and how i thnk the game could improve before i continue i want to say that i have a very fun time play this game and i would most certainly recommend this game to anyone who have play smash before at either a competitive level or casual level because it be not only a very similar concept but it also feel very fresh and new with the addition of weapon that change your moveset completely this alone set it appart very far from smash while also keep the core of what make it fun which i think be very nice with all that be say here be some gameplay mechanic that i think should be add and why short hoppingreason it be really hard or sometimes even impossible to approach with an ariel with a lot of the time your option be to either dash attack or to jump wait a long time then use an ariel and that to me do not feel like enough option and personally i feel like add a short hop would give the player waaay more option in term of an ariel approach and ariel movement which i think could enhance gameplay greatly a walk speedreason maybe this be already a thing and if it be you can call me out for it but from what i can tell there be no walk speed which be very annoying when you be try to approach without use a dash attack or turn around for a strong attack but then again i be not sure how this would work for keyboard so idk you could add this if you want but it would not change that much it would just be nice fast fallingreason it feel very hard to get back down to the ground when you be up in the sky so add this would give people more option when want to get back to the stage and who know maybe people could add it to there combo game example be dash attack then short hop into forward air then fast fall into maybe a strong attack i personally think this would be very fun an up weak attack or in smash term an up tilt reason well i mean why not there be already a down tilt so why the heck would not there be an up tilt it also would give more option for against ariel approach which would be very nice it could give every one a well combo game as well neutral air and up air should have different move reason it feel wierd when you put in 2 different input and get the exact same thing as well as it could make moveset more diversesorry for this hugeatmatmatmatmatmwall of text 3,pos
1558,early access reviewafter more then 130 hour i just can not be positive anymore dev have go complete silent no update lose player even emassarys be stop this game have some really nice gameplay but all the thing like dead server dupe hackingye there be a fly speed hack already only tweak ini file only thing they can do now imo be close the server and wipe and try again in 6 month its a shame i have high hope for this dev team but in the end its how do we make fast money if even the translation be do cheap you know something be up to all you people who think they should try it do not yetmaybe in 6 month who know if you be bored and money be not a problem buy the 30 usd one and nothing more will keep an eye out the next few week but i doubt something will change,neg
1559,i really really want to love this game but i can not the concept graphic and scale be fantastic but overall the execution make it a mediocre fps the combat feel clunky and no matter the setting the weapon feedback just feel completely disconnected from the mouse input like it be build around controller with the mouse be an after thought i do not feel the technology be there for this to run as an fps require again no matter the setting use the frame just feel wrong and stutter further make the game feel clunky and disconnected in addition there appear to be significant de sync issue with cover be almost irrellevant as you may be behind cover on your end but on the other end you be not and continue to take fire when you should not the unlock system break the game in a f2p fps game it should be an unlock system that allow you to build class to your play style however this be an upgrade system that make you character better faster strong cause balance issue finally it go without say but you will need a team for this one it be brutal for the solo player and even with a public group you will find yourself be stomp by more coordinated team at the end of the day it be f2p so by all mean try it but i would strongly advise avoid spend any cash on it i do and i regret it,neg
1560,early access review edit just as i say i will change the review to positive as soon as they add solo queue again i be glad that they listen to the community and do not take too long this game have so much potential and i be very excited to see how far can they take it definitely give it a try i can not wait to fully enjoy the game now thank to everyone who like this review everyone else who try to support the same idea and the awesome dev for listen to the feedback and actually do something about it and even leave a comment here keep up the great work the game be quite fun i do not give it a negative review because it be a bad game however i can not recommend it if you be a solo player not be able to queue solo be a dissapointment and before all the tryhard kid go but you can play duo or sqad and do not fill 2v1 be easy no just no i do not wanna play 2v1 and no i do not wanna play with random if you play with friend then totally go for it as i say the game be very fun but if you be like me and enjoy to sit back and chill by some solo then better wait until they add them i will change the review once they add solo but for now i just do not enjoy it as much completely ignore this gamemode should not be a thing,pos
1561,360 hour on steam and thousand on the stand alone client back before there be tank the grind to unlock vehicle be reasonable the game feel progressive like you could still manage to unlock later tier such as iii and iv without go premium crew matter flesh out different plane be engage and fun one of these patch in the last year or two have bring the grind to an absolutely unbearable crawl this game have always be about grind but there be a balance between grind and progress which the dev have mess up when you strip away the progress reward mechanic that people endeavor for in game you be not create an environment of entertainment anymore you be waste their time and this should be carefully consider how many thousand of hour be you willing to waste i try premium for a few day just so i could dump all my rp into unlock the tiger never end up unlock it and the level of progression now with a premium account be the same as we have play this back in 2012 f2p so in conclusion there be really no point in playing and it be not that progression have be put behind a paywall hey support the dev they need money to develop guy it be be put behind a paywall and neuter to such an extent that you will literally grow old before accomplish much of anything beyond tii unless you pay for it do not waste your time or money these be the kind of model that ruin gaming make the game sell the whole thing not cut up into a million dlc and prosper as digital artist if your game be solid,neg
1562,early access reviewan overuse concept with some welcome addition to that base formula that allow for an intriguing if not all too familiar experience the actual game itself be litter with bug which be to be expect with the nature of alpha build all in all the experience be enjoyable but still nothing special although the recently increase and already very rapid and active development that be base off of the feedback from the community be a welcome change of pace from a competitive shooter that be not see elsewhere and lead to hope for the future of this game as a whole overall i would give the game a 6 5 10 in it be current state,pos

1605,early access reviewthis game have so much do right eliminate a lot of the rng hstone card bring yet fast play as hstone provide and extra depth that mtg element bring and yet they fail to improve on the broken land mechanic of mtg its one thing to win or loose a game because you be draw badly or well yet to be completely eliminate from the match because 7 land come up in a row i do not know mtg be amazing but after all these year you can not tell me someone can not come up with something well because its insanely archaic i have build deck explicitly on empow mechanic and yet there be enough stun removal so that if you be only draw land you be dead in the water it just seem to happen to often other than that the game be incredibly free to play and have do so much so well but the sigil land mechanic have not evolve at all in 25 year i still think this game be actually great but dayum the land draw be simply horrible and should be a side effect board,pos

1617,the game have such an up down style of competence so i would rate somewhere in the middle but as there be only two option i be go to choose no it can be immensely fun and if make by any company rather than gaijin it could be a very good game but with the direction they be head i be not get a fuzzy warm feeling on the good side it can be amazing fun with three different game style with vary realism and ton of different ww2 aircraft to choose from after a few hundred hour however the downside of the game really show the balancing in wt be usually questionable to downright bad especially at hig tier where german and japanese ww2 prop see postwar american jet russian bias no but definitely some extensive support for the russians from dev where we get another yak to add to the pile of 20 no option to opt out of gamemode like the new and awful air domination which be one big cluster you do not want to be a part of also odd alternate history match that really should be able to be deselecte this review be just for the airplane by the way ground force be so terrible at the moment i do not even want to mention it,neg

1675,this game use to be amazing i play most of my time on xbox one and i still think its a brilliant game but my review be base on how it be now and not the fun i have have in the past effectivly all the content before you hit a platau be to get you hooked in the story be pretty unimaganitive its all about well loot as be all mmo really once you cap you have weekly and dungeon the real campaign but to really get anywhere in this game its hugly pay to win want a decent mount above 80 speed how about 10 pound minimum spend how about a new decent companion yep 10 pound minimum spend expansion for the game how about 40 pound and there s a few i buy the dragon expansion a mount a companion and a few other thing and realise even then i be nowhere i end up spend 80 pound to hit another platau and before i could even get to where most of my clan where the game would have expect me to pay 200 500 pound the game be infact verryyy expencive and it try to hook you in with the first buy then you think ohh i can not go back now just no its a game with no real replayability unless your willing to spend a fortune you can not even make that much in game money that yes be transferable to real money to buy stuff but untill you have spend to much the more you spend the more you make very very pay to play if you want a game you can keep play without have to spend more and more money then i would not recomend this game at all as my old mate admiral ackbar say its a trap,neg
1676,early access reviewthe overall gameplay be enyjoyable and the quirky cooking theme be unique despite my former statement this game be very unfair and dull for the majority of the game allow me to explain to preface this be only from my experience if you want to play give it a try i understand the fact that battle royale have rng luck play a roll in your success in cuisine royale case though i feel like it be too random 7 out of 10 game i spawn out in the middle of nowhere with nothing around me except for one tiny cottage with a random ammo clip and a scope other game i will spawn in a decent location and i will end up loot 6 house and leave the area with a c96 pistol with 8 bullet and a pot on my head the game dull for the most part due to the fact that for 90 of the atmatmatmatming game you do not engage with anyone and do not even get me start on the gun play the accuracy of weapon in this game be atrocious largley due to bullet bloom i do not understand why some developer add bloom as a game mechanic but it be atmatmatmatmatmatmatmatm it destroy the majority of skill that go into aim your weapon and it make fire fight for the majority of the time down to luck due to this bloom you tend to use a magazine of ammo on one person in most weapon with the exeption of the mg 42 and the ppsh and a few other which lead to tough late game when you be lucky enough to have regular engagement in the game in my opinion it reward hiding instead of engage the weapon damage seem inconsistant as well some time i will put 15 bullet into someone and they will not drop and i will end up lose the engagment 0ther time i will completely rip open the guy in like 3 bullet i realize that there be most likely hit multiplier but nobody should need to be hit 15 consecutive time to die it be glitchy as well i be play duo with a friend and we be go to win the game but instead the game decide to clip him into the military fort that he be stand on when he go prone ontop of it ultimitely trap him and kill him this game have a lot of potential i know it be in early access i will keep play and i will re review this game if the developer fix issue and be proactive in the community look forward the accessory mechanic be a very good addition and make the game unique compare to other battle royales darkflow studio even though this be an april fool joke to begin with if you support this game and innovate upon this idea you could make something really fun and it could be extremely popular optimistic for the future i still recommend this game since it be fun but it be break in a lot of aspect i want to address them while give my take on this game and thought for the future,pos

1684,this game be shallow and un balance the first hour of play seem fine you get some easy win against player who have no idea how to play the game then the balance change and you only face people who have pay to unlock all tower the bad part about this aspect be that when you pay to unlock these tower you completely bypass the level system so two player can both be 100 dart and one player can have simply pay for every lvl 3 and 4 tower so basically at a certain point its impossible to win without pay for the tower so a first time player have to look forward to get pull into the experience and then lose every single match bar none for 30 match in a row this game be a shallow pay to win failure i have 100 complete bloonstd 4 and 5 and i can not stand this game this game only exist for micro transaction the game itself be a hollow shell to make you pretend you be actually accomplish something against other player when in reality this be a cesspool of kid with their parent credit card effortlessly win against free player pay to win or stop play that be the good summary of bloon battle i can give,neg

1718,aparently the game be make by the same team that make diablo2 which be not the one that make diablo3 it really be d2s sucessor the gameplay be pretty similar with the single big diference be the character customization you can make literally anything you want from a necromancer templar to a dual wielder deal elemental damage since i be such a big fan of d2 back in the day i have to try this game if you do not want to read all of it skip to the end you have several class to play the one you pick basically set where you start on the passive skill tree at the end of chapter 3 you unlock the scion class which be the most versatile and can easy become whatever you want when you level up you get point you can use on the passive skill tree to make your character strong the passive skill tree be truly gigantic hence the huge variety of choice when build your char you also get gem that you slot into your item each gem have a skill and the gem level up as you do you can connect gem for extra effect as there be many support gem that do not do anything for themselves but enhance other gem with damage skill duration blind enemy extra effect like make melee single target skill splash for target around etc there be 3 type of gem and gem slot red green and blue red be typically the brute one and therefore require strength the green require dexterity and the blue inteligence this gem system be very versatile just like the passive skill tree the game currently have 4 chapter while chapter 1 and 2 be kinda easy chapter 3 get hard and final boss on chapter 4 be pretty damn hard so let sum it up pro easy to play highly character customization want to shoot a cone of fireball as wide as the screen that also deal lighting and cold damage want to have an army of zombie spirit and totem miss your whirlwhind d2 barbarian and want it back but now deal elemental damage yes please madam free to play area change so each time you replay each area the map be different con visual perk like wing and stuff be pay like guild chest or extra chest tab but you start with 4 so that be hardly an issue take a while to learn and master the gem system but once you get roll you can make truly amazing thing get kinda boring after a while so just start another class lol,pos
1719,great spiritual successor to diablo 1 and 2 what be not to like it be free old school 2 5d graphic lot of customization option ability to play with friend and a much longer storyline the diablo 3 unlike most game f2p which make money to help people power their character up pay 2 win grind gear game sell character visualization enhancement overall it be a great way to strengthen that right pointer finger click clickity click,pos

1722,while writte this review i have over 1000 hour play several character with max lvl and finish all end game content the good pretty good and enjoyable combat system pretty much the reason i still play it decent graphic option for free 2 play player to get almost everything from the real cash shop though it be hard and time consume decent event and promotion once in a while include pvp event hourly activity event system this be one of the good thing which can happen to mmo it pretty much help to reduce queue time and give some bonus reward to the player the bad this game have few heavy curreny exploit which totaly ruin the econmy lot of the exploit currency be not remove and impact this game to this day many exploiter be not ban and run in good in slot item without any penalty real money mean very little unless you can spend several thousand of on a game basically if you would want to get full bis gear you would need like 2k of real bug take month to get fix if they even bother to fix them in the first place lot of overpowered item which come from lockbox sadly this game be not live on cosmetic stuff like dota 2 several end game instance be often nearly unplayable due to server lag very poor class balance extremely poor pvp balance for example you can move your good in slot enchant from your high lvl character to a totaly low lvl character and use it in pvp because it have no min lvl require i think i do not have to explain how much impact it have even at max lvl pvp there be insane gear gap between player refile system pretty much pay to win feature it make all your gear useless so you have to spend lot of real to get nearly bis or bis gear or pray to get lucky with some extremely rare drop this game do very little to reduce the gap between old and new player if this do not change in near future it will be the reason why this game die,neg

1724,this be a very good change of gameplay compare to league which go back to that game feel too easy and rather dull in gameplay compare to the dynamic action in smite here be beginner god you should try that i find too easy to use adc cupid apollo neith artemis mid posidon kukulkan anubis scylla vulcanjungle fenrir loki great for split push thor mercury basicly the hecarim of smite support athena sobek ymir change ares if enemy buy purification bead buy cooldown reduction tanky item solo pretty much any god can solo easily in smite even support like sobek ares yimir even the adcs can go solo lane since most of them be equip with mobility or with good crowd control attack smite be a third person moba with the same objective as dota and lol 3 lane 2 jungle 2 jungle boss tower inhibitors pheonix titans nexus i have be play this for over a year now and personally i find the gameplay control to be alot more fun and it have its own unique stragety to it for example your map radar only show near sight of enemy object but only you can see what s directly in front of you you can see enemy in the distance but your ally can not so you need to describe the enemy situation by voice command build into the game or if your fast type in like kukulkan have low mana or anubis stun down along with voice command that say ultimate down for my experience the community have be pretty sweet up till 2016 where i start see more troll and rager than ever you will expect some poor scrublord to rage theirat you in any multiplayer game but they do not even know how good you can be in late game team fight which sadly low elo and just incompetent player do not understand,pos

1753,it be mincraft with an awsome twist you start out with a glove that can suck element toward you instead of just drop them and as yuo get well glove you suck thing faster the whole piont of the game be to not to quote another game go deeper into the planet untill you reach the bottom the catch however be it get hard with each layer you go pass and you need a well glove and well armour and wepon aswell in a survival point of view it be fantastic mainly due to there not be the need to manage food or water or sleep or sht like that there be food but its more of a later game thing for exotic pet so they give you more resourses when i say exotic i basicaly mean pet that actively try to kill you if you do not tame them fast enough on the hard mob you really have to trap them in a way they can not knaw your shin off like by get high ground to where you can reach them but they can not jump up to you if you be look for the creative side of mincraft i be afraid that be not realy a thing but creativerse compensate for this by not have food to worry about if you go to bed before the moon of death appear and do not absent mindedly walk of a cliff you will be fine oh and final point do not go within an average restrain order length of a cave without at least 50 tourche full armor an obsidian sword and someone to listen to your frantic yelling of your will,pos
1754,early access reviewi can not believe its free the ending be definitely unique to br genre 0 to 4 team can win as long as one member survive to reach the chopper attachment auto equip which be nice for inventory management,pos
1755,i have allot of hour log into this game and roughly almost every dragon in this game there be pro can con of this game for one it cost money to unlock area and get well item and dragon unless you have at least 3 boulder dragon for stable quest near titan level it be almost impossible to raise gem without real life cash get involve as well the membership for this game be not worth the buy whatsoever do not pay for membership for this game ever for 30 60 one can easily buy the whole game via area buy with gem and a couple dragon egg chest as well while the membership cost around 10 monthly and there be at the moment no way of cancel your membership with a 1 click system so it will continue to take money off even if you do not want it too unless you create a forum page and actually spend the time to write back and forth to a admin be not a admin for the game but just give the info to another admin so it literally take about a week to cancel a membership a normal kid will have no idea how to do this in my honest opinion 2nd the game be cpu intense instead of gpu intense there be no way to change the graphic setting they be perma lock at 1 set and your cpu will do almost everything for the game instead of say your dedicated graphic card 3rd glitch upon glitch in the 125hrs i have play this game i have get lock out of my main viking at least 3 time for several week and i have to go though forum admin and normal admin several time to get back into the viking and at 1 point no one in the world could age up a dragon because there be a huge no age glitch unless you use gem to age them it be impossible and it be not fix for a 2 week time period and there be ton of more glitch in this game that be not noticable tell they effect your gameplay for example the telescope glitch that will not let one click on the telecope on the ice island that have not be fix in around a yr so then you have to do around 20 quest to be able to finish it and click on the telescope in berk to finish the quest on the ice island i do not recommend this game for child for these reason i only play it for so long because i love how to train your dragon so much and own all the book and tv series and movie,neg
1756,this game be constantly be balance and update but its also constantly be fill with cash shop item and hat to suck out your money they say that hat would just be novelty item too but then set hts be introduce,pos
1757,lololol all these negative review there actually quite funny but i do not agree with its a pay to win game join a beginner server and there be tonnss of weapon like seriously pay to win maybe if you do not want to walk everywhere vehicle in the game range from 150k 500k but other than that its quite alright i do agree about the looonnggg wait time and some bug but hey free game i seriously do not know why some people be crash and wait to join server for a half hour i have a low end laptop that i can play on at 20fps and i do not have problem laptop info processor intel r core tm i5 3337u cpu 1 80ghzinstalled ram 8 00gbsystem type 64 bit operating system x64 base proccesorpen and touch full window touch support with 10 touch pointsye it may get boring but hey you can make some more friend through this and also it be much more fun to play with friend give it a shot check for yourself and do not take other people opinion just because they do not like the past producer of the game,pos
1758,this game be just as bad as it be the first time they keep reinvent the game title to suck in new player without make any positive change no improvement to the animation character model environment gameplay no story the only new thing about this game be the add pay subscription for their crap content these developer only excel at rob your money without provide an experience that be worth the price,neg

1762,there be a lot of work for reto to be do like listen to their player but this be still a great game and recommend if you be look for a ww2 fps and be tired of the generic battlefield and cod series can play as germans in ww2 10 10 would play again,pos
1763,to be honest i be quite surprise that how to train your dragon be recieve so much love dreamworks be release a new tv series plus later movie i be a jumpstart veteran i have be with jumpstart game since adventure land be release and i have to say the virtual world be get well would love to see more update on their other virtual world like eatmydust and supersecret sadly i must warn you the game do have it be bug gliche and downset for example in fireball frenzy your dragon body be cover some of the bottom target there have be know to be hacker for the game which do make it unfair and can be annoying when you see a 20 foot tall whisper death also if you be plan on get the age up option for your dragon it will not level your dragon up it would only give you the ability to fly now i do have some suggestion perhaps an arena base game you guy have do it before with the monster mutt in mathblaster so it should not be hard recode some part and redesign some texture also you should allow egg buy from the viking store to be use as your first dragon i really want to experience the quest with the changewing from the very beginning,pos
1764,i really can recommend this game to many other player out there i rellay love this game and i nearly play it everyday i just love the game cartoony style and all the nice lil goody like free update not like you have to pay 20 buck for mann vs machine mode its free i buy tf2 in the orangebox when it be not free to play however there be also many cod kid now and its just funny to hear them rage because tf2 be much much hard to play its hard to play because of the fact that the player have to complete a objective while fight in team against each other,pos

1766,raceroom racing experience be a thing where you put the lad on the line so they get to the end faster than the other people choose from over one gender of driver to completely personalise your profile interaction and user experience be more akin to that of a misaligned shoulder cavity but please do not count that against it it do not know any well believe me when i say i be not sure what raceroom be but i think we can all agree that this world would be well if i do not even know they exist,pos

1768,as much as i love yu gi oh game there be many well game that you can play other than this it be annoying that the good way for you to get card be by spend real money instead of in game stuff that you should earn by beat other npc also the difficulty do not seem to change even when you level up what i would like be for this game to add a whole lot more such as the normal 5 space instead of just 3 which be dumb space for link and pendelum card and a propper way to earn card that will not mean spend 4 99 or what ever the game price be as well as the crystal thing you sometimes earn just for 5 or 10 pack which only hold 4 or 3 card if this game add a lot more and fix the cash grab problem it have it would be well,neg
1769,this game be really fun although many people think it be a rip off of smashbros it be not th egameplay be much smooth in my opinion and combo be really fun to do and learn all the sound in the game be really cool and be not too annoying to listen too the competitive system be fair and it be easy to learn and get well,pos

1771,early access reviewwas little boring at first but soon as i figure out the mechanic i have a lot of fun play 5 hour straight with my brother today do not even have time to go to the toilet,pos
1772,once this be a promising game but the developer have drive it into the abyss too many change in the gameplay and no proper roadmap make the game a sandbox for the developer the performance be not satisfactory and the networking be modest too so if you like a dead game with performance problem and no future then this be just what you be look for they have a roadmap s but change the whole game be not like update should be,neg
1773,early access reviewcombine the good of 2 world the slick and intuitive design of hearthstone the advanced and comprehensive mechanic of magic the gathering and introduce new one not possible in physical card game while differentiate itself with interesting lore and a generous and worthwhile free to play model,pos
1774,pro great sound great simulation feel cool camera tossing depend on drive surfacecon not free2play the content be on a demo level you can not unlock any content for free you have to buy every single piece of content no multiplayer yetcomment purchache all track will cost you about 40eur and all car will cost you about 15eur at this give time graphic be not impressive but they be still decent if you want to try out all the car and track this game will not exacly be a fair deal in that case you be probably well of with another simulation racing game,neg
1775,please note my hour play be highly unnaccurate i have clock roughly 300 hour prior to have a steam account as someone whose first moba be league of legend smite be really a breath of fresh air for me the grapic be simply amazing and it feel like a large step up for a moba game compare to other out there the one thing that blow me away be just how many event and how many skin you can buy with favor the currency you get just from playing game skin buy with favor be basically just recolor but it be still more than most free to play game would give you smite bring the action right into your face as you play from an over the shoulder camera angle which actually make you have to aim your auto attack something mostly unheard of in a moba before smite come around there be so many mode to choose from and if you pick up the god pack preferrably on sale you get every god ess they release forever it feel like smite just bring so much more to the table than any moba before it one thing that always go overlooked when people talk about smite be the lore the people in charge of create and release new god really do their research into mythology to make the god ability fit their myth or lore as a fan of mythology when i be in high school i find myself read the lore and actually look up some of the god i have never hear of from other culture just to read up on them interested in how they all fit together i have not yet find a god in smite whose ability set do not fit their theme in my honest opinion my only issue with smite as it be now be it be not very new player friendly what i mean by this be if you come from another moba and or that be your main genre of gaming you will be entirely lose on how to work your way around smite as i be to start out the balance be also a major issue that i have notice compare to most other mobas it do not seem as bad until you get further in and the character you hate go against turn up in every game feed beyond your wild dream and stomp all over your team if you be a fan of the moba genre or even just want to give it a shot and want something new in your library i highly reccommend give smite a try,pos
1776,early access reviewprop to the developer for the amazing quality of the game despite be a joke there be a good variety of weapon and they feel solid not to mention they sound amazing the graphic be hand down one of the good i have see the overall quality of the game be staggering and be free to play it be an absolute steal,pos
1777,early access reviewokay so like most thing this game can definately be improve and i would hope that it would consider it be still in beta i be go to say a limited amount of thing since i still do not know too much about the game yet just base off first impression i be run this game on a non gaming notebook and run very well matchmake for the most part seem to be balance i do not really like the spawn system you can either spawn at the main base or a apc jeep but you can not spawn directly on a base you have take at least in the game mode i have play most of the people in this game be not super terrible and seem to have at least average intelligence of how to play as a team it be take quite awhile to rank up compare to how fast i think i would rank up but i guess that be not such a big deal only the fact that you unlock certain class game mode after you reach certain rank i will edit this review as i play this game more,pos
1778,early access reviewthe power flooding screw how you mulligan and how inconsistent your deck play ruin what be a competent online ccg magic the gathering be already an exercise in frustration with its 60 card deck eternal have 75 card deck why this just increase the odd of draw a streak of card you can not utilize result in many game where you literally lose the game without play a unit this combine with the game harsh mulliganing where you can only mulligan once to which you have to dump your whole hand result in a crap shoot that often end up with these wildly polarize hand if you somehow manage to make a game more inconsistent than magic the gathering then you be do something very wrong it be really fun when you get a reasonably balanced hand but too often your option be to draw power for 10 turn in a row or not draw power for 10 turn in a row,neg

1780,nice graphic for a free simulation that be all that there be to it now the negative point in short community gameplay balance mod supprters developer premium as in op and expensive as hell and buggy as hell it get bad with every update and gaijin seem to care less and less detail community friendly fire be the war thunder way to say hello also you have to pay for the repair yourself also you can not disable friendly fire also report friendly firing teammate will make your team a lot weak than it already be after all the quitter leave also there be no way of join a normal game later so you be pretty much ed if you have an on your team i usually have 2 gameplay wow cool as if camping and sniping for hour without end in other game be not bore enough you can now do it in a tank that take 5 60 second to reload after every shot depend on how ed you be mother yay yay king of the hill mode like i have not see that one before yay domination something new yay there be literally nothing interesting in this game except if you like to drive 10 min with a tank at 15 mph to try to flank the enemy just to get one shot also one shot you will get one shoot all over the place do not matter if the enemy be right in front of you or a mile away you will get one shot through building the floor debris dead tank and even ricochet from a friendly unit balance t34 good tank in the world world war win tank with stalinium armor and cryptonite ammo enough say the russian bias be real who would have think it it be a russian game after all interestingly gaijin write about tank at level 1 0 battke ranking that be able to deal with tank at level 3 which be true but they do not change the level of that tank nope seem about right also tank level seem to change with every day pass and depend even of game type you be play but you can not look up the real fact when that very tank have what level so that after you make a decent team and join a game you see that the level be all over the place and your once balanced team suddenly have one very high level member and you now have to fight other player that have way strong unit not as if one shotting be not a huge issue anyway now you can not even retaliate supporter mod developer there be actually a forum where you can post all your bug report just to have them ignore yay each update come with new bug yay old one rarely get fix nay premium how about you pay a on of money to get great unit to fight realone great be not it you be invincible and can one shoot everybody for some cash also you can buy the whole game for million of doller awesome some people actually grind all the stuff for year on end yeah them amirite gaijinalso who the come up with these idea spawn point be not possible to get artillerize but can very well can get bomb airplane should start out be build out of wood so that you catch on fire the first 100 time you fly it until you have research the last def upgrade same applie for tank except there you can not upgrade you def normally but fire extinguisher be not available from the start either also you can not repair your tank from the start either everything have to be researchedyou can help your squadmate repair but not your other teammate it be also not possible to repair a tank if you have not make that specific upgrade even if your squad mate have the same tank as you do and be around to help but you can not start repair fire can not be put out under wateryour crew drown literally in 3 secondsmap usually look like each team just come from their respective base to the battle still you start out with tank all over the place srsly noone drive a tank backwards to battle not even the ai not even 90 tilt also you spawn on in eachother which gaijin only could solve by make your tank impervious to damage for some time at spawn great but useless against all spawnkiller and traffic jam at game start if your tank tire chain be damage your crew immediately refurse any order for a second and stop drive to start repair it asap nice feature right nope you can not hide like this from enemy fire you can not put your tank in a more favourable angle to the enemy fire you will have to wait 4 second to be able to do anything also crew do not give a damn if literally everything else be destroy but hell brake loose if the chain be loose killing ai will not give you any point whatsoever for research your already very weakly start new unit so that it be even more of a pain to try and use new unit also most match have like 50 ai which make for very boring since not very intelligent play the great pro have to face the great noobs fact how else be they go to sustain their high rating this game be not a game it be a simulation gaijin the only thing that differentiate it from other game like world of tank except everything mention be the very unrealistic battle jk but it be true sim battle that noone ing play for many reason that i be not go to get into there be a lot else i do not want to get into too but i think i be exceed the character count would i recommend this game have you read my review do you still want to if you want to camp and snipe around there be well game to do so if you want to go teamkille trolling there be well game to do so if you want to play a beautiful game there be always new one with well graphic,neg

1782,early access reviewlast patch remove the tech tree and give previously low tech weapon tier some benefit over their high tier counterpart this be good now new player have access to flight component they also remove the 100 return on sell item nerfe it to 20 and switch from currency per match base on how much you get do to give you random part this be horrible now new player can stare at those flight component and know that its hundred of hour of playtime to get them also where before they would have be able to experiment with all unlock tech freely due to 100 refund on part now they lose 80 of their progress if they sell piece meanwhile those of us who already have decent block stockpile be rock highly cost efficient robot to smack down noob with that enemy missile launcher you be have trouble with you can have that just play a few thousand match that be not hyperbole it cost 137 5k robit which be 687 5k worth of sell part a match may give you a couple hundred robit worth of part if you be lucky thousand of match and when you have do it you have that one part not open access ot it and all low tier just that one part want to try a sniper helicopter or a gun sled or a bomber that be a whole new grind or you can toss 80 of your effort out the window and sell your shiny missile launcher the old grind be go the new grind be bad,neg
1783,honestly go into this i do not think i would find this game to be as enjoyable as i do it be just a really casual unmoddable version of early minecraft but with more emphasis on material and with more of a vaguely sci fi slant rather than minecrafts vaguely fantasy one there be a few quirk in the engine relate to be build in unity rather than java for instance unitys physics be a bit spotty and sometimes underground mob will hilariously fly through the earth into the stratosphere as if call to rapture however from my end the game seem to run much smooth than minecraft do and it be much easy to set up a multiplayer server the big negative i have for it be that it really spend a lot of time advertising dlc to the point it really start to get annoying but hey at it be heart it be essentially another minecraft and who do not like minecraft,pos
1784,i enjoy many type of game but horror be my favorite genre and as such i tend to be more critical of game that claim to be scary if you have tell me yesterday that a game could be scary cute clever and funny and succeed on all 4 front i may have guffaw at you but i be currently take a breather in room 400 1000 and to date i have have approximately 31 small heart attack and twice as many chuckle i would certainly have pay 20 for this since it be free you have no excuse not to try it,pos

1786,in my opinnion the good racing sim out there at the moment great ffb and physics realistic ai that do not file up into a train behind you awesome audio that sound right try out the callaway c7 and compare to the real thing for example people whine about the price but i think the concept work great the starter pack eu map pack will get your realy far and provide more varied online gameplay than for example project car 2 that cost more than twice of that content sure pc2 have more content include but you will not find anyone run it online,pos

1791,early access reviewi much prefer this game to pubg i think pubg have a bit of an identity issue and want to be everything this game balance it out quite nice and the 3 different form of movement really add to the overall pacing of the game my only issue with this game be the combat the refresh rate and the grapple movement option combat seem a bit stiff and favor camping i know camping be inevitable but maybe add a gas molotov grenade to flush people out or something lean should always be a key bind action if implement refresh tick rate of the game seem a bit off on my screen i shoot dead on but die to a head shoot a second later it be always go to be an issue with battle royale game sure but it be still a legitimate claim if they want to be competitive or have a public k d win loss statisitic the grapple movement option be severely limited to the predetermined route on the map and the rock climbing be next to useless and extremely slow a glider player could just get ahead of the grapple player and wait for them to show up to the next point and shoot them or the grappler could risk take a fall and die or attempt to go back up the rappeling line which be extremely slow to turn around they should greatly reduce fall damage for grappler or add a parachute or increase the speed of the grapple movement and landing aslo something can be say about the game end heli but i do not have a solution for that yet overall 7 10,pos
1792,early access reviewlike the game over all have have some fun in the battle you do need too pick the ship you want carefully or you will get hammer the other player be not go to let you slide the graphic have great detail could use a little more detailabout the ship like the armor rating of the ship an there damage mittagation would like the up grade to be accumlative and permaneant as well as expirience point for the crew stat like the game would allso like the taget range ship too have two setting nuetral or combat so you can messure the ship you pick in combat,pos
1793,ok let start of by say i only recommend this game for compititive player with an iq high than a bag of rock people be just so awful in this game we have player run into terrain and shooting at the sky sometimes not even move at all will not stay in group and will not help their teamamte in trouble the list go on and on it really be a fun game though it be an arcade tank game it will not be anything like the original world of tank wot or war thunder it be also not a pay to win you can level up just fine by grind and you also get plenty of free reward like gold and premium tank by simply participate in tournament and daily event,pos

1796,i still can not believe this be free to play amazing game huge battle lot of play style vehicle basis and on top of that if you choose to you get to play organize as a platoon comprise of 4 squad of 12 player each with amazing coordination if you find the right people one of a kind it be not ptw but cosmetic upgrade can only be purchase with actual cash aside from that anything that be relevant to the game can be buy with in game currency that you earn play the learning curve be a bit steep so give it some time,pos
1797,early access reviewthis game be incredible almost excessively generous ftp model and gameplay that echo the good aspect of both magic and hearthstone while trim much of the fat a highly recommend,pos
1798,early access reviewi expect this game to get well over the year but all the dev be do be try to make it more profitable with microtransaction now i just feel that i waste all that time by expect it to get well this game be now far past its prime and it will keep go downhill the developer be try to force people to spend money when all they need to do be make a good game,neg
1799,while the presentation of this game be phenomenal and the variety of card be already strong this game be extremely stingy with actually give out card with high price slow level gain and wide variance i just do not think this can stand up when compare to other f2p card game on steam,neg

1805,early access reviewa great experience be since the start proud to be part of this idea work hard on some balance go back and forth on change listen to community and keep the game update will definitely be a great release once they finish tune extreme imbalance between class ps the new update for 07 04 2018 make the game kinda annoying on solo mission with grow hp the rest be just greatgood fun mostly in co op game soloing get boring after a few victory and shenanigan,pos
1806,early access reviewoh the balance issue if you get drop into a crap location your good option be suicide seriously if you do not get a decent weapon nearby you really have no chance after about one minute and when you blast some poor sucker in the first few second with your shotty and he have a knife you kinda feel bad for them but what suck beyond belief be the number of time you get catch in furniture and other prop its a major design engine failure that make it so frustrating the game be not worth play until they fix it,neg
1807,neverwinter be a pretty cool f2p mmo so far lvl 26 i have not notice any paywall prevent f2p player from advance the game have a nice farming grind system to give f2p player some cool stuff overall the game seem fair and be pretty fun the questline be focus and do not branch out a lot but this be not necessarily a bad thing because the quest giver be fully voice and the quest offer more than just the typical go there collect kill x of something esspecialy towards the high level i think the game be nicely cater to newbie mmorpg er but it also offer veteran a good run for their money or in this case for free,pos
1808,early access reviewi like what the game be it have a lot of fun mechanic and feature though a bit unbalanced however i simply can not recommend this game i buy the jekks bounty campaign for a little fun but mostly to get the extra card to hopefully expand the ranked game i be sorry to say but this campaign be absolutely rediculously difficult some boss be easy but the one that be difficult be so beyond difficult it simply make the game unfun i be not oppose to a campaign to play through to gain new card but i should not be stick on one boss for multiple game to which i still have not be able to defeat just to get the reward of card i do not mean to compare this game to hearthstone but at least when hearthstone make me pay extra money for card gain through a campaign they do not make the campaign so rediculously difficult that i basically can not complete it instead they make the main campaign for the card fun and the diffucult part for an extra bonus such as a card back i just do not understand why the developer have to make such a rediculous campaign for some card that just be not that powerful so completely agonizing i be mostly dissapointed that i be stuck on this campaign that i pay for if i could get a refund then i would not care as much but since it be a promo item this mean i be stick with a campaign that simply be not fun and be more frusterating than anything now the bad part about it be that i feel not that i have completely waste my personal time on a campaign boss that i still can not defeat absolutely rediculous figure out how to balance this poor develop completely,neg
1809,i play a lot off steam start back around when plane be in beta as the game have move forward and new thing pop up there be one thing that remain the same and that be a complete disregard for the community and balance and in some case gaijin even in a subtle manner taunt the player base acknowledge the fact that the grind be unbearable as some country and the entirety of the ground force favor pay to not waste your time and it can be many hour or day for late game match have no solution for player be kill in one shot because they do not have any way to repair or stop their tank form burn down while more upgraded tank can result in you beat your head against a wall unless you be go to cheese the game mechanic or get good at snipe and wait for half an hour for stuff to kill be soft cap even if you carry the team to victory although the invisible tank problem still exist but be very hard to catch when it happen it do happen when fight around rubble and there be a lot of it plane have be neglect as they work on new stuff however it be more balanced than ground force but you can cheese the game more and the dev encourage it often draw out battle for little gain and do not even consider the naval battle they be a joke aircraft be pointless and the game try to mimic wow cqc battle with small ship but do bad kill same size ship be a hassle for little gain kill small ship be fun but for little gain and kill big ship require be sneaky but you be soft cap and will not get any further than you would have fight same or similar sized ship for less fun and drag the team down and be unlikely to succeed just a quick thought on the game hope this save people time as get in early mean almost nothing unless you solely play this game spend all your free time as new player get more boost to get past the early pain that you will go through and collectable vehicle get bring back for sale or near impossible event task or you can spend 5 50 100 usd on something that may not be worth buy as you probably leave the game before get that money back in play time however they be good at not revoke thing you earn or buy so if the game become worth play at some point it should still all be there assume someone do not hack your account then there be nothing you can do as their support be nonexistent extremely useless saved incase they decide to go on a neg review deleting spree as they have do in the past,neg

1818,all these people whine about pay to win probably never stay for the event that kog keep put out and why be people complain about the unbalanced pvp when there be so much more to the game no peripheral vision for these thing whatsoever costume and extra skill slot and maybe even some extra mana or anything for in game benefit be all purchase at someones own conscious decision and to everyone bash the game just because they can not get those thing you do not need them kog be not innocent in this either they be make all kind of appeal cash item available to us especially costume and summon but all of this be optional and it do not make or break gameplay the game itself be not pay to win at all and while in pvp ring and such give an advantage but it be mostly skill that people develop as they play dungeon play be great with multiple player and four skill usually do one enough and people complain about the b slot just want to have more skill to use when there be plenty of bread and butter combo and skill to use and as i say early event exist for just that the past few event have quest that earn you a 15 day slot b medal and it be hard to keep throw jab at the game after you realize how generous they be be this be a very well developed game and it have a good team work on it still they constantly put out new event and update that keep the game fresh and it make for a broad range of thing to do when you get tired of do one thing basically unless you play for 12 hour a day to grind experience point the game will always be very fun every time you play,pos
1819,in its current state i can not recommend it mostly due to the sheer level of bs level of grind not to mention the way they treat the community they literally insult the community by compare the m1 abrams a top tier tank with part and fpe which be essential to maintain a combat functional tank with one of their counter argument be that it be always there as if that make it okay these people be hopeless grinding for part and fpe have be make slitghyl easy by remove the need to research two modification to get to rank two which have fpe it will also automatically research track or tire which be one of the most idiotic thing i have have the displeasure of experience we have be wait italian tank for a while now yet we still only have two premium and helicopter can spawn camp from mile away not to mention how frustrating some of the tiering be the kv 1b and kv 1e but the kv 1b be the big problem be just an up armor kv 2 l 11 with a f 34 gun yet it be a low tier and the jumbo have no right to be able to get down tierd into 3 7 recently they have also start make more and more premium top tier vehicle this give any idiot with a credit card a ticket straight to top tier for a while top tier american team be get they crap push in due to noobs buy the xm 1 fill a match that should be fill with people who know their stuff with a bunch of noob make match extremely unbalanced i be not go to be surprised if gaijin end up censor this review but i will keep play it mostly due to how much i be into ww2 tank right now but if another game like this come along or i move on from tank i most likely will not play it ever again we have be promise italian tank for a while now yet we still only have two premium and helicopter can spawn camp from mile away not to mention how frustrating some of the tiering be the kv 1b and kv 1e but the kv 1b be the big problem be just an up armor kv 2 zis 5 yet it be a low tier i be also not go to be surprised if gaijin end up censor this review but i will keep play the game mostly due to how much i be into ww2 tank right now but if another game like this come along or i move on from tank i most likely will not play it ever again,neg

1826,i love this game they balance it really well so that there be not a whole lot of idle time at least not until high level when you start to hit your partys limit at that point restart your game will reward some idol which give permanent dps damage per second and gold percentage increase so the next time through you will be able to get further you only have to click to kill with your start character the bushwhacker all other automatically do damage to the close enemy on the screen and it do not take long to save up and recruit the 2nd character so if you do not like to click spam then this game do not make you do it much but if you do like it there be plenty of upgrade to make it worth while it be totally up to you whether or not to click for extra damage after you recruit the 2nd character i always replace the bushwhacker with someone else as soon as i have recruit that many character some character do high dps some boost the dps of other character and some increase the amount of gold enemy drop so there be a strategy to decide which character to field in your party depend on your immediate goal there be three save slot so you can save different party configuration and quickly switch between them i like to have a dps party for progress and a gold find party for when i log off or if i want to save up for something another fun strategy be rearrange your party member for maximum dps output some character boost the dps of erveryone in front of them and other boost the dps of everyone next to them so put your high damage dealer in a position to get boost by both most character have a skill that quadruple their dps output every 25 level and there be no limit to this that i know of every five level have a boss character with a chance of drop a chest chest have large amount of gold as well as item that your character can equip for bonus the item stay with your character after reset the game if you find a duplicate item for a character their dps be permantently boost by a small percentage i can not think of anything bad about the game it be what it be a casual side scroll click idle rpg with basic but cute graphic it be not diablo or grim dawn but like those game the magic be in the gameplay decide what to upgrade next saving up for it get it and watch the satisfying effect of your good choice as your dps meter skyrocket and the enemy start die almost instantly then you can advance a few level where the enemy be a bit tough but the gold drop be much rich and gladly do it again,pos
1827,i really wish i could recomend this it be free and omages classic horror in clever way but it commit the cardinal sin of horror it be bore the jumpscare be surprising but end up just annoy quickly the room appear random and that just kill any imersion that may have be build i be on floor 200 and i just do not care enough to finish,neg
1828,now let us just be clear here i like this game but i do not recommend it because i do not think many other would you see i do not really care what i do in a game i could just be walk around and i would enjoy it but that be pretty much all there be to this game just walk around a few fetch quest to do nothing much there be not even a story just get a dragon and perhaps grow some carrot the game be full of monotonous repetitive task that would leave most bash their keyboard to kingdom come out of boredom so therefore i deeply suggest you do not download this game and if you do i will shed a tear if you spend money on it really,neg

1833,early access reviewwall of text inbound great game amazing game i love this game to piece at least i use to the game be awesome up until recently than crate arrive actually i should not blame one update i suppose if i be to pinpoint the starting point for this disappointment i would have to point my finger at the introduction of the crf this feature which i would like to say be nice in concept intensify an already present issue within robocraft and set in motion a domino effect that more or less lead to the train wreck we have before us today the crf allow for the rapid deployment of op bot or rather exploitative build i be go to use the tesseract as an example while not a huge issue on its own it be the way freejam go about resolve this issue that make matter bad to any veteran of the game that have some knowledge of the problem the simple and least devastating fix would have be to nerf corner slope health to the point where use as armor would be ineffective a more complex fix would have be to fix the exploit that allow the construction of the build armor sadly freejam do not choose these option and instead decide to add not 1 but 3 now 2 but still weapon design to deal with these build while the build be successful in their intend task they also take the rest of the game aerial population down with it this be not a review whine about badly balance aa though so onto the next nail shortly after this fiasco fj introduce epic loot a system widely revere as the complete opposite of its namesake alongside rip out a system that be work just fine and be much simple to balance they supplement this change with a system that could be best describe as gamble in a system where the house win 9 time out of 10 instead of a system where player could either work for or pay for a specific item they desire they be now force to test their luck with crate crate that logically fail to reward a player common sense dictate that high tier crate should award better loot this make sense the crate fj have force upon us do not follow such logic high tier crate rarely reward suitable loot in fact it would appear from my experience that low to mid their crate be more likely to reward a player effort this be ing stupid period there be also the complaint regard the premium row flaunt item however this have not really annoy me as much as other move on to the big one a lack of communication between the community and the developer can and will be this game downfall if every problem list before this be group tight and weight as a whole they would not come close to overtake this issue as simple as this problem be it be so bad in fjs case the simple action of posting plan for balance change or suggestion on the game dedicate forum be so foreign to those in charge that someone look in from the outside would likely see it as nothing more than a place for angry customer to vent why no dev will respond with exception of drognin but it be his job as community manager and we love him for it 3 the dev that have a proper power over the game development use twitter instead of their own forum it be dumb anyway as if this be not long enough i will quickly list the pro and con of the game so tl dr pros 1 builder may be entertain if they get good stuff 2 not pay to win because buy crate just mean you get more crap con 1 dev be usually silent unless they be be praise 2 balance weapon what be those 3 exploit meta build everywhere creativity doessnt seem to be a major concern to fj 4 hope you enjoy gamble i really like this game but sadly i can not recommend it to anyone because for 1 you be not reward for and the dev do not seem to intent on fix the issue,neg

1835,this game be a kind of simulation of airplane you be able to fly certain plane in a simulated environment in military mission there be many plane available though most be extra dlc you only get the soviet su 25 t for free which be still very fun to play generally you should have a joystick with thrust and use either trackir or something like facetracknoir to control your head movement in the cockpit also important to mention be that the different dlc also call module with their plane have different simulation difficulty some have a non clickable 3d cockpit with simplyfied flight model and some like the a 10c require you to basically learn how to start up and fly the plane in a way you would do in reality with all it be button switch and so on overall it be a great game not the most accesible but the free plane be great to explore whether you like this game and you can always decide to go more hardcore with other plane or difficult mission aaaaand you also get the free mission editor campaign editor which allow you to create your own content so all sum up you like flight simulation and fighting jet try this it be nice,pos

1843,the game be great i have be play since the early early open beta around a year or 2 ago and love it i would have give it a 10 10 but now ever since a patch that come out around last december i would give it a 2or3 10 the gameplay be the same and be very fun to play whether alone or with friend but now you have to grind grind grind grind grind just to get 1 plane before i could just buy plane after plane in tier but now i have to grind for research point which be very hard to earn to research a plane plus gajiin go and have to make the game go from free2play completely only buy if you feel like it to have to pay if you want to unlock a new plane in less than 50 match or more you basically have to buy golden eagle so you can convert them all to research point to speed up the research of a new plane i would still reccomend this game if you be into fun aviation type game and play with friend but the free2play aspect be just no longer here,neg
1844,with almost 300 hour on this game and my first ever steam review i can firmly say that this game be absolutely fun to play however unless you be willing to put much of your free time into this game you will not go far it be not a game for people who just want to pick this game up and play it you need to invest time or money will talk about this in a bit with almost 300 hour although i have almost all the playable unlockable ever class unlock exclude vanguardian and many cosmetic mastery 298 you gain these mastery point from cosmetic and level up i be nowhere near end game for an mmorpg although i have access to all the content i just can not deal enough damage to be invite to late game run a because i do not have time to grind constantly and b i do not spend enough money you can get anything in this game over time without spend money however it be tedious because get well be much on rng without spend a ton of money gameplay wise this game be really nice 6 10 however if you do not want to spend more than 50 on this game it would bring you almost no fun without 300 hours4 10 overall,neg
1845,want to point out to the new player that the economy and balance be effed out of the universe so be aware however the game be enjoyable until tier 4 that be y all have a good game,neg

1847,early access reviewlooke at it for what it be a cross platform phone pc tablet it be not that bad face it this will never look like black desert on pc it will look the same as in your phone so no point in point out the obvious or ok no graphic be not that good for a pc game in the year 2016 but ok for a tablet pc cross platform thingy but that be fine game like this be best play on your tablet anyway while do no 2 or hide in the garage from your wife who want you to take her on a trip to ikea with that say it be pretty basic so far no surprise classic mmorpg formula and it get a long way to go before it be do but i see some potential in it as it be so i will give it a thumb up for now it be free and only 50 mb ish since the game be mostly serverbase i guess so why not try it out and see for yourself only thing i notice that annoy me a bit be some delay while zone and looting but it be beta guess it will get sort out in the future,pos
1848,probably one of the good and bad arpg that i have play it be great in the aspect that it allow a lot of customization of your character build and in turn enable a lot of different playstyle the game fail in the aspect that it the playstyle you choose you be effectively stick with there be little tactical about the combat in this game outside of spamme what your build be good at and then hope for the good,pos
1849,fallout shelter have arrive for pc as a mobile port itatms still a bethesda game and itatms still fallout but can a mobile fallout game work on steam first of all the game be free to play so yes you guess it it have micro transaction in it but i will write about that a little later the grafix in the game be very true to fallout and that please me when i see that itatms very well make and you actually get the feeling that you be play a fallout game now the game start of as you been a manager of a fallout shelter and you give it a name then you be take through a tutorial of some of the basic and then you be set and go for the rest the problem be though you still donatmt know half of what you can do in the game or what the game later will introduce you to there be a help section and i can only recommend you read it because it give you valuable information on how to management your dweller into the right place so you get fast resource and this be where the problem really start in my opinion and where it show that it be a mobile port the waiting time you have to wait for resource be pretty long when you really canatmt do much else 2 4 minute to be allow to press a button to get resource be a long time the first 30 min you be pretty occupied with the game because everything be new but then it start get bore there be small event that happen like animal infestation or attack on your vault but thatatms pretty much it i be miss a more eventful game maybe earthquake or something else than a fire that can happen because you try to be greedy with rushing resource the game have different item armor gun and pet in it that make it more interesting and it be cool have your dweller run around look different a way to increase your population be to make love and produce babyatms and that be a funny feature again though it take soooo long time to actually produce a new dweller and have it grow up to be able to work in your room now if you get pass the waiting time and play it as a normal pc game you will eventually get enough dweller to unlock the observere room where the more interesting part of the game open up be able to send your dweller on quest be a nice feature but yet again the time it take to do something be brutally long range from 30 min to 5 6 houre for your dweller to get to a location be something you just will not sit and wait for this be yet again a place where the mobile part of the game show because you be more inclined to close down and look at it again later when you be on your mobile phone than on a pc you donatmt want to open up a game to play for 10 minute to close it down again wait for new thing to do when you actually get to play a quest you get a new mini game where you have to kill something or answer question about fallout i like this part in the game i just donatmt like have to wait 1 hour plus to be able to do it off course if you use nuca cola which be the real money currency in the game you can get there instant and now my rant start the starter pack be 4 99 euro which be fine you seem to be get a decent amount of thing but then the price go up 4 5 euro for 6 nuca cola when it cost maybe 8 to go instant be way overpriced i be inclined to say that if you do not pay money for the game you canatmt play it as a pc game and have to play it as a mobile wait game and that be where i get annoyed if you port something to a specific console you should really make sure that the game be still fun for none pay player or ask a decent price for it and lower the time for thing to finish even minimise the game to try will eventually pause the game have it to reload when you return and if you havenatmt buy the starter pack you donatmt have the handy auto loot machine run around pick up loot for you yet again you be lose out when you donatmt pay the sound in the game be standard for a mobile game itatms not great but itatms all right it work for fallout shelter should you play it well that depend if you want a game where you be occupy all the time and have to wait for thing to finish be a bother for you without pay for it then this game may not be for you if however you donatmt mind have a game you open up from time to time and play for 10 minute maybe 30 if you do a quest then this can could be just what you need in your life,neg
1850,early access reviewafter play the game for more than 100 hour i decide to write a review the developer update from time to time so there be new weapon mode and map and i can guarantee you it be not p2w every weapon available in this game can be acquire just through play the only reason you may want to buy in game currency be for skin either weapon or character skin graphic be not amazing but good enough i have a lot of fun with black squad and it be free so give it a shot try it out,pos
1851,early access reviewgame be horribly optimize extremely laggy and basically unplayable outside of the tutorial and that be even if you can get log into the game on the server you want do not buy wait for a sale or f2p to give it a try but do not waste money on this,neg

1860,early access reviewthe game be decent and all all those people who say it be well than hearthstone be probably casual who do not even know how to play hearthstone the game be good but not as decent or close to hearthstone that be say the tutorial be long than the duration of all the time i have s3x combine which be sad lol but worth a try thou edit 7 hour into a game try multiple deck combination some be my own some be pre set by the dev and this game be double penetrate in term of balance of course some card in other game be op and break but this whole game be base on that there be deck with a 0 chance to win against it be just that you have to get ready to press concede with diginity rather than watch your health drop 30 or something my review be to try this game but after try to put time and experience into it nah i do not think it be playable like that sorry,neg

1868,if you enjoy wait 5 10 minute for a match then match that be entirely unbalanced and then have the match overrun with hacker then look no further i always hear people complain about hacker in fps game but this be the first time i have see actual scripting it be uncontrolled and unchecked the admin do not do anything because the hacker pay actual money to purchase item in game if you manage to find a well balanced game without hacker it can be fun this happen very very rarely please look at my hour play i know what i be talk about if you play in the game american team lose 9 10 game this be not an exaduration once you commit a soldier to an alliance he can not change you have to start over as a german or russian this be seriously the bad production for an online game acceptable issue in beta not in a finished product game designer if you be listen get your hacker under control until then bye,neg
1869,an excellent variety of ship with different playstyle i do not play a lot of space combat game but the tutorial lead you through nicely and the space comabt meet my expectation of what space combat should feel like great hulking ship with a massive array of beam and laser canon and small more mobile ship with cloak function and other trick on a free to play level it do not take much grinding to get whatever ship you want and the ship be relatively balanced however i have experience a few game populate by toxic player that trashtalk other player even those that be obviously new to the game but there be an option to report such player,pos
1870,do not play this game its the digital embodyment of cancer will delete all ur progress as soon every time your get somewhere in the game stupid creator should have fix this year ago when it come out,neg
1871,ok so overall i think this game be very good it have its main server and stuff for those who just wanna casually play but not just sit around it have trade server so people can screw around and trade stuff and the community server have all the various mode that be not commonly available or those that be not available at all very strong community and very strong game with load of variation all for the low low price of free heavily reccomend it,pos
1872,early access revieweven tho the game be in alpha much smooth than competitor and much more fun no build system and feel alot well still a litttle unbalanced but hey its an alpha enjoy every second so far,pos

1874,early access reviewgood look environment cool spell and forge mechanic although the combat be really poorly design and most of the time the more important factor be luck not a skill however if you be look for some fun to play game this game may do it for you,pos
1875,early access reviewone of the good game i ever play straight up greatgame its team base great gameplay and its only in alpha aaa if you miss out on the free weekend where you if you log on and you get the game for free then you miss out big besides that its worth the buy in for the early access its just a greatgame if you like space ship type game again one of the good game i ever play,pos

1877,early access reviewthe only thing more red than communism be the recent review page for this game they honestly ruin this game be much more enjoyable back in 2014 until the hacker overrun the game and now the dev completely ruin it,neg
1878,early access reviewgreat gameplay reminiscent of all the great tcgs for an early access the art be above the par better than hearthstone already and much easy to get into and to amass in game currency it be the good online tcg i have ever play and almost well than live magic the gather people have issue with the deck size be too big and get mana probs but those individual have probably never play magic it all just depend on balance mana and that be a problem that be easily remedie by just learn how to build properly as well do not play online unless you have a well deck than the beginner series the matchmaking system care not for your deck content so you will be match with high tier deck than your beat the campaign first amass coin in gauntlet get some new card and build a well deck first amazing game wonderful content awesome gameplay long running battle provide your opponent do not play aggro deck with absolutely wicked play that can be make with the large mana draw this game have compare to magic 10 10 would recommend again,pos
1879,this game be continuesly compare to league of legends and dota 2 and for good reason though generally look at primarily as a league of legends clone smite actually take a different approach into game mechanic and especially p o v point of view where as league of legends and dota 2 work out as a more linear top view design smite do in a third person persepective where you can see the area around your god now for the game mechanic it be pretty straight forward with w a s and d as your movement key 1 2 3 4 as your skill mouse 1 as your attack and mouse 2 as a cancel key and e and f as your relic like league of legends and dota 2 itemization be key into first learn how to play and the role be pretty similiar in the competative level a solo laner usually bruiser a mid laner usually a mage range champion a jungler usually an assasin type or tanky and can initiate an adc apc generally range champion but can be magical damage base as well and a support generally with hard crowd control peel or initiation disengage the community may not be as big or as widespread as other it be compare to but the one it have be strong and continue to push update patch and change mostly positive to the game as a whole and i wish it continue to do so as hirez in my opinion do a good job in make sure the community interact with its developer overall i would give smite a 8 5 10,pos
1880,for those who be curious about this game but do not know what its all about imagine the lovechild of minecraft and planet explore both very good game this be a survival crafting game with a tech approach very interesting concept i buy this game when it be first release at the time it be buggy incomplete have very little to do and the game environment be very plain and boring so i uninstalle it and forget about it i do not remember how much i pay for it but i feel very disappointed in the game i just reinstall it yesterday and find out that the game have go free to play you now have to pay a fee if you want the add feature i write to the dev and ask them about the pro package and how it apply to people who back them on release they reply to me within a few minute of me post my question in the forum probably the fast reply i have ever see they say anyone who buy the game would get all the pro feature for free i be delighted that i do not have to repay for anything so i get back into the game and see that there be so many more feature and texture and block to play with that they do not have before unfortunately this game be still unfinished i be disappoint that they have not yet do anything with the water biome or create aquatic creature but the rest of the game seem pretty solid they be lack with the variety of creature you encounter and i be hope that more will be soon to come i think i will put this game on the back burner once again until this game be more finish so for right now it its current state i recommend people put it on their wishlist and check back from time to time to see what progress the game developer have make but for right now i would not want people to buy this game it have great promise but it still have more that need to be do keep up the good work dev bring us more content and keep us post with development,pos

1884,while i have only play about 2 7 hrs as of 20160927 the game have pull me in quite a bit i be not a fan of mobas but the title do a really good job at mask the moba concept it adopt 5v5 with two lane essentially and an arena in the middle that open up occasionally during battle the team base combat do not feel too pushed but you can really feel the necessity when fight against human player as with most competitive mobas perhaps my favorite feature of the game be the f2p aspect in essence this be how all f2p title should work if you choose to spend money it do not give you an advantage over other as you be only unlock the ship and crew member soonr as well as obtain skin for ship overal this title be a must play i mean come on it be free what do you have to lose just uninstall it if you do not like it,pos

1887,dtm experience purchasable in game be overpriced 40e do not represent the quality of this game as it be i would say 20e would be a good price 25e a decent price and 30e a high end price 40e be simply too much unless the 1 0 version of this game will be of significant well quality which i think it will be because it be only in beta0 2 at this point so nice game but need plenty of development and as be it be overpriced,pos
1888,early access reviewit look great it sound great it play great and it do not feel like it pay to win heck i would even say it do not feel like a free to play game it be not perfect yet however server stability should be improve and matchmaking should not under any circumstance match you up with player that have 200 ping but that be say this game have huge potential if they can keep the micro transaction limit to cosmetic item and tweak the server a bit this may be my new go to game,pos
1889,at first glance seem to be a minecraft rip off in actual fact the creator have apparantly take the block concept and do something very different with it it be very very enjoyable and i have only play about an hour so far can not wait to explore more if you be go to compare it to something minecrafty then probably something between mc and tekkit here,pos

1895,early access reviewokay i have be prove wrong before when i have enjoy a game in beta but i really hope this go through into actual full release when people say it be like smash they be right when thy say it be a smash clone they could not be any more wrong the basic set up be very smash esque but the play be a style in its own right you play on a 2d stage with minor element of hazzard such as pit fall and smash an opponent off the stage which be all very smash like but where it come into its own be its style of combat you all start off bar fistedwhich all have the same move set of a straight knuckle upper and sweep to knock an opponent off but each character have two set of weapon which you obtain randomly from pick up in on the stage a good few seem they be clone but most have their own unique combat style and flare make no two the exact same to play as you also play with low gravity and a lot of move capable of keep you air bear make for some cool air bear fight and juggle even when it seem to be over when you be fall to your death you can make an epic come back when you use the right move from the edge of the stage the combat style be what i love the most though about the game it be all fast all go with no time to rest yet it flow really nice and keep you excited even if you be lose you be still just enjoy the rush and pace to top off each character have their own bio and be quite unique in the look department and varied there be quite a selection already and can not wait to see what other character they release and what new weapon they include all in all if you like smash get it if you like a decent and develop fighting experience with quirky character get it if you just want a game to let off steam on or just enjoy pvp get it,pos

1899,early access reviewman oh man this game have some serious potential and i do believe artix entertainment will fulfill every bit of it in make aq3d i follow this game back when it be just an idea that have a few post about it and ever since then i have always have hope for this to be a thing i myself have play and upgrade in all of artix entertainments game i actually start pc gaming as a whole around the same time i begin play their game back in early 2007 i have enjoy every single game they develop and i can guarantee that this will be no exception as of now this game be worthy enough to invest numerous hour into and it be only in early access do not look at my hour i play before aq3d be even greenlit on steam so if you get the chance play this game you will not regret it,pos
1900,bad graphic and its not really that fun when there be just a few ppl go around try to kill you its just not that fun when you lose everything cuz someone sneak up and shoot you why do i want to grind for item i just have just to lose them again,neg
1901,early access reviewwhile i do not play for very long it be like a complication due to the manner in which i be play over a verizon dsl network streaming from a windows 7 pc to a window 8 laptop the main problem i encounter be a slow network connection from the router not the game fuzzy graphic that do not want to play nice and display properly on my laptop likely a result of not configure them properly on my desktop first or even have to do with the router again and drop from game in the middle of a fight which i can blame on verizon once more but it may have have to do with the game itself overall i would recommend this game the gameplay i do experience have a focus on teamwork on strategic maneuvering to enable you to appropriately apply the force you have at your disposal from fly a capital ship and well 3 dimensional movement in space combat be always nice this game be for you if you have the patience to play a moderately pace game be willing to work with your team mate even if they be stranger and have be look for something that focus on large ship space combat this game will not scratch your itch if you be look for a game like tie fighter vs x wing you will not by fly small fast fightercraft and engage in dogfight and that be okay there be other game that do that some in space some not so much war thunder last i play do a very good job in give you plane to fly around and dogfight in overall it look like a game with a good amount of potential that have already live up to a fair bit of it it be an early access game so expect bug but the feature that be already in from what i have see lie out the foundation for a solid game,pos
1902,this appear to be a mobile console game port over to pc it certainly play like a mobile game it would feel right at home on my droid turbo 2 that should be enough say if you be look for any level of decent tank combat simulator because this be just not it edit i actually look this game up after post this it literally be a mobile game port to steam i have see some folk mention in their review to skip this and get the full wot game from their website also free but i would say skip both and go for war thunder i start play that game in 2012 2013 and i never play tank until recently and it take a while to get use to into it come from plane but now it feel much well and more natural than this game i download this because i play this game long before tank on war thunder and i enjoy it but this just do not compare to todays ground force in wt can not wait for naval force over there either,neg
1903,download it a couple day ago play 16 hour straight it be very smooth addicting and huge mmofps it be not just a fps the game work a lot like real war infantry need air support and tank support to take location in total they be hundred of location to take faction choice be more preference base then gameplay change base you get some different look stuff and some faction have well stat towards item that there faction be advertise to be you can not log into this game as an experienced fps player and expect to go 40 5 score like you may in cod or other related game this game be about teamplay and stratergy they be 6 different unit type all of which can counter or push or sneak the enemy to help your team group unit outfit clan faction take an objective i still do not fully understand the game which be a surprise since i be one of those kind of 40 5 player when it come to fps game on the pc however this be not a game where you call people noob or get godly score infact most people do not get good score the game say you can die a hundred different way and it be practically true the game be about the real war vibe soldier attack objective die over and over until air and tank support finally take over sound 9 10 very realistic and immersive make you feel like you be in an actual war with the light off pgameplay 10 10 can feel unfair at time but the over all goal and experienced be more then achieve by the game combat 8 10 again can occasionally feel unfair but not unabalance luck can help as well as group play air combat 11 10 so realistic and responsive require a lot of learning and practice to dominate tank etc 9 10 very realistic but can not be effectively fire use third person shut you down from your surroundingpay2win this game be free to play some gun be cash only but a lot of gun be in game credit you will find yourself somewhat grind here i be only able to unlock some gun attatchment and upgrade after 16 hour of gameplay however the beginner gun be very good they be not make crap to force you into buy you could happily and easily use all the beginner item forever and be a good player however i feel some cash gun do offer advantage but it be strange the pace at which someone can die be never change by the gun some gun just assist the person mean if you be a good fps player it will not matter if you be a new fps player or a bad one you will often find yourself over power by cash user over all not anywhere close to p2w ps the sniper unit can cloak small vehicle and fire from them whilst remain cloak sniper unit can also use some rifle be stealthe with a rifle for me be a broken aspect of this game and one i do not enjoy or support snipe it be nothing like call of duty or other fps game so if you be a quickscoping fanboy do not bother with this game sniping be very realistic you have to aim where your opponent will be bullet travel time and distance vastly affect your aim also most beginner sniper do not one shot unless headshot but do lot of high damage which be how it should be like air combat sniping actually require practice over all rating 9 10 completely free to play no hacker that be overkille the game lot of stratergy group and action not pay2win addictive and balanced feel like cod battlefield good of both world with slightly less graphic compare to say battlefield i would say on max setting this make any cod game look simular graphic i have a msi nvidia gtx 970 over clock at maximum overclock and i get 100 120 fps with very high setting in fight of 1 12 or 12 24 i get about 60 80 fps in fight of 24 48 and 60 70 in fight of 48 96 and 96 the texture of the game be somewhat ugly compare to other game but this be often misunderstood as a bad thing you have to load about 30 400 player in one somewhat small objective area at one give time include the sky the tank and turret mine the map itself the rock and map design and filler include helicopter etc all move at once i feel the texture be bad for a reason the game be unplayable on any standard none gaming gpu amd nvidia be require at atleast about 70 per gpu 2 gpus or 200 for one gpu to run the game at an eye pleasing level,pos

1911,early access reviewi have play a lot of other card game this card game be the good replacement for mtg fan who love standard or modern but could not get through the major pay gap but hate the uninteractive aspect of other online tcg game like hearthstone the big difference from mtg be that counterspell can not counter creature which in my eye be really nice those big creature that you love to play so much will not be circumvent by a silly 2 drop counter spell in their full hand they also do not have a silly thoughtseize god i hate go second against someone with a turn 1 thoughtseize something people can explain say better than me be about the pve element not to familiar with how they compare to other but i quite enjoy it anyways i actually enjoy this a lot more than mtg and hearthstone,pos

1914,ok so its dota 2 the large and most popular game on steam at the time of writing if you do not have this game and you be an avid gamer you will most likely pick up this game at some point due to the fact that it be free and well why not from a graphic point of view at maxed out on a gtx 660 easily it look fantastic and that be not even the good graphic card so the requirement arnt huge but much low than that on budget pc with the bad graphic card ever and you may get a few people compaine about your wooden pc increase the time to load up into the game and if bad come to worse you can turn it to complete minium and i bet you that even if you laptop have one of the bad gpu on the market you can eventually get it to run at a playable pace from a gameplay point of view as you can see i have spend well over 500 hour on this game so it must be pretty good and some other reviewer have spend from 1000 hour and above the reason well there be 1 map that have a few variable that can change the game such as the rune weather you get a good creep from the jungle to control and take on your enemy with so 1 map you think hummm that must be pretty limited well yes i would kind of agree with you but the fact be that becuase of the 100 hero and many hero combination and counter no game be the same with each game change the way you play slightly depend the character you play how you play it and who you be against and how they play it so the game do take a while to get old and even then have the same map mean that you can really know it like really know it how to do specific techneque and pull creeps where the enemy hero can see you and how to position yourself so in that term the gameplay remain fun and interesting while still for player like me challenge the community this be the one issue you get with this game some people be not very forgiving for your mistake and there be a lot of anti russian stuff mainly because when you go to play on an english or us server and you get strange man shout at you and your team in a strange language that no one on your team but him can understand people get a little to say the least annoyed althrough the high your battle rank and mmr i will talk about that later mean that eventually you will get player who actually make an effort to co ordinate with you the rank system and how valve make its money so the game be free and so how do valve make its money well first let me explain the ranking system basicaly after each game you will recieve an ammount of battle point for you to increase your battle point level each level you will recieve an item i think and acasionally you will be able to open a present to get free item these item can also be drop through luck randomaly to people at the end of the game valve also sell hero costume in the dota store in game shop these item will only change the look of your character and will not actualy affect the gameplay which i find very unique and mean that there arnt huge pay to win in the game which annoy me hugely when people make a good game and then make it pay to win these costume item be very effective with the steam market allow player to sell their item cheaply to other player but valve still profit of that by take a transaction fee also due to the popular steam workshop player can submit their item design to be avaliable in game and they will also get a cut of the money make which be a nice thing for new artist to make some money while have something to potentially put on a cv also when you reach a battle point rank of 13 you will unlock rank matchmaking which will allow you to play game with other people of that level 13 and high to increase your mmr with the top mmr be 7500 and bottom 0 you really have to be bad to get 0 with 5000 mmr be very high mmr be for more serious player that want to really test their skill with other of that level but on a down side note 2000 2700 mmr be very hard to get past as there be people from all different ability so that can be a little dificult to get past but eventually with experience and a little luck you will get past and eventually be on the climb you your ability level this conclude my review for dota with a few 10 10 statisticsalso please consider take a look at my youtube channel where there be some dota content and some help video for new player 8 5 10gameplay 9 10community 6 10 as it get well later onranke progression system 9 10,pos
1915,i have spend hour upon hour play diablo 3 i love that game too this game be pretty awesome in it be own right but while they come from a similar mold the two game be as different as night and day i think both be good personally but what make this game really amazing be the outstanding value this game give everything you would expect from a triple a developer literally just give it to you nothing that be sell in the store be in any way go to help you win the game unlock content that be need or give you a special edge in the game it be a full on retail value game literally for free play it all you like make up to 24 character have a huge share stash by default i be go to end up support this game eventually when i get the money not because i have to but because i want to this game make you want to pay for it because it be freak awesome if this have not get you interested i do not know what else will but if you be a fan of diablo torchlight or the genre in general you should give this a whirl without a doubt,pos
1916,after spend countless hour into this game i feel i be ready to give my side of a review yugioh have be a trend ever since the anime show of yugioh plus people like us duel with card like in this game it be a very fun concept duel where player vs another player duel against each other use monster trap and spell card it be one of those game that make it very fun to play and still this game be originally from mobile now i will get to the most detailed part when you start the game you have 2 legendary duelist you can start off with seto or yugi pick any 2 do not impact further into the game because you will eventually unlock more new legendary duelist by complete mission what be great be most card be very balanced however the downside be cut 2 trap spell and 2 monster zone from the original mat but you still have graveyard field zone extra zone for your fusion monster you can compete against the world duel with your friend buy card pack available to buy hope you score well card customize your deck your card and mat layout there be alot you can do oh do i mention you mobile user can transfter your datum to your pc well now you can if you do not wanna drain your phone battery by play duel link well you can play it on your pc instead in conclusion i would truly recommend this game to any yugioh fan out there despite not have 5 monster zone and 5 trap spell zone 3 each be not half bad give this game a try you will not be disappoint,pos

1921,excellent little game some other review s have complain about the fact that in order to disassemble the choose gun you have to do it in a specific order of part while yes this be unrealistic the game have time trial to entice some competition and incentive to play it over and over again and to give muscle memory through repetition and allow you to do it faster the model be all very detailed the control be also all excellent as be the hitboxe for some of the small part when you be click on them even if your click be not super extra precise the soundtrack be not super annoying to me personally which be a major bonus i highly recommend this game for people that be interested in gun or just want to kill some time tl dr good game much fun decent sountrack high replayability massive variety much detailedness do download and play,pos

1924,team fortress 2 seem like such an understatement when i say i recommend this it be probably my favorite game of all time with over 2000 hour log on it even though people may not like the hat and new item personally i think that be what keep this game alive every time the game feel like it be get boring or repetitive they add something new that make the game feel fresh and fun this be the only game i think i would ever give a perfect 10 10 because the game always expand the community on the other hand be quite a lot like the sonic fanbase and i will just leave it at that in conclusion if you have not play this game before do it i can not stress that enough download it and play it it be free but i highly recommend buy something in it at some point in time,pos
1925,early access reviewmagic the gathering be know as a definition of tcg but at some point with all those expansion and new mechanic it become incredibly complicated and unfriendly to new player soon after that blizzard release hearthstone the renown digital ccg which quickly get well deserve popularity as a casual and easy to get in f2p game but few year later hearthstone now come alongside with some issue mostly its rng base mechanic and debatable balance of some card come with new expansion and adventure so the story kinda repeat itself and hearthstone get more and more complicated and hard for a new player just like magic do at this point people that be hook in by hs start look for something else with less rng and more skill base or rather prediction base gameplay and here we be look at this beautiful game call eternal with great art style magic like mechanic and casual feeling of hearthstone the game be evenly interesting fun and complex summary the game be fresh and worth at least check it out beautiful graphic interesting mechanic but still casual enough to enjoy even small session of game,pos
1926,in my opinon the best free to play game on the market i first find elsword on steam then download the game from the official website i have spend numerous hour on this game i have find that some part of the game become very repetitive play the game for too long without take a break cause me to get bored this be a game that i like to play for an hour or maybe a bit longer take a break go play another game then come back and play more overall i believe this be the good overall free to play game on the market,pos
1927,first they come to our phone then they come to our computer at last they come to steam this game have make very little change and from the start it be almost a clicker game where you would have to click on the production room to gather the supply they make and for a phone game it can be understandable but not really okay by me the game would have be by far a well game if it be make more as a strategy game where power food and water be continously gather but always go up or down so if you be head towards too low you have to make a new room or find well people work that room rather than just risk set everything on fire and continue the clicker game basic where they start it be free so why not give it a try at good you will love the boring gameplay and eventually find the quest okay or at bad you will not play past day 1,neg
1928,another poorly design iphone game port to pc after the first half hour of play you sit around and wait for something to happen then you get bored and frustrated so you gamble on rushing which use xcom rule to determine if you succeed i e if it say 40 chance to fail it be more like 90 when everything finally goesup include half your population the game wave it be microtransaction in your face remind you that real money will fix everything on top of that the good way to play the game be to not play it the game practically play itself and disaster only happen when you be micromanage slow boring frustrating and stupid basically another hamfisted cash in to sell microtransaction do not waste your time and especially do not waste your money,neg

1942,a huge let down everything be lock behind microtransaction good luck shoot anything that you actually have a liscense for let alone anything at all lot of unpolished wonky stuff like track your character sprint like they have polio and about as fast aiming be borderline impossible since your character can not hold his gun still to save his life i hunt in real life with a compound bow and i can tell you right now that it be waaaaaaay easy in real life go buy a hunting license and hunt real animal you would be surprised how much fun it really be,neg

1993,i like the game do not get me wrong but personally as a player who preffer plane over the t this be my opinion that be tank and naval air rb be my favorite gamemode and the only reason i still even waste time on this game that and its more relaxing than league of legends which i be on a break from to keep this short for the love of god gaijin be well than riot and low repair cost for air rb or just do away with repair the game be already grindy i do not need to bust out the fat calculator everytime i go into rb and lose 14k because german cannon,neg

1997,what can be say about this game that have not already be say nothing really but here go nothing it be kinda a diablo 2 clone but do have its own original gamestyle be it fun hell yes be it worthy schwing be it worth it um let us see free i would say yes if you be an arpg fan than jump on the wagon train and ride this puppy cuz your probably not go to find a better free game of this genre,pos
1998,the game try to keep you play by make one of the gun available to buy with the currency you earn from complete mission when in reality there be not enough mission to be able to get enough currency to buy the gun if you be wonder why i would not just use another gun it be because you have to use the gun to tag rabbit,neg
1999,i would recomend this game to everyone because it be open world and be a massive multiplayer fps with amazing graphic and stunning battle experience the one thing i love in this game be that it give you the ultimate feel and experience of battlefield battle be huge and intense they give you adrenaline everyone should give it a shot at least once game be just fun and stunning,pos
2000,early access reviewcreativerse show so much potential though it be basically an ftp version of minecraft it be a lot more detailed and more fun than most minecraft copy that i have see the only problem that i can see be the fact that it be online only which i do not have a problem with personally but it do create a problem for those who travel a lot or those who do not have a very stable connection a few suggestion for playful be basically add in workshop support so that user can share their world and creation or at least add in support for server so that we do not always have to play with friend another thing you guy could add would be something like minecrafts creative mode for those who do not prefer survival and maybe a mode that add in hunger deletion of all item upon death and the need to sleep for those who enjoy a more hardcore play through all and all creativerse be a great game i definately recommend it to those who enjoy sandbox style game,pos

2003,early access reviewi it fun yes be it worth money depend the game be an early access version of what will eventually be a free to play game with a tech tree similar to the like of war thunder or world of tank however it throw away the tier and instead balance all ship together into one matchmaking block similar to mechwarrior online it be enjoyable for a while but the grind begin to get excessive the good news be that you be not go to need to worry about repair or ammo cost which eliminate a point of stress in the grind the graphic be also absolutely beautiful unreal engine 4 be put to the max and boy do it look good the ship also be interestingly design the game have two mode a tdm style mode and a capture the base mode both be enjoyable but something like this could really use some more mode to keep its longevity and now onto the negative these mode will not keep your attention forever and you will quickly want more the various class of ship give a huge variety of playstyle but again you will be grind a while to get a ship you may or may not like unless of course you decide to throw money at premium currency in which case you can push to that ship faster and this be a bit of a problem unless you have snag the game on a free forever weekend you have already toss money at the game and now they be ask for more money via microtransaction this however be only a temporary problem since the game nee not be buy once it get release there also be major server issue despite there only be a peak of about 1000 player online in the world half the match i be in i will get severe lag stutter that be serverside not on my end final thought i would suggest you definitely get the game on one if its free forever weekend it will definitely net you enough enjoyment to be worth the download if you want to get the game with money i would also say it be probably worth it especially with the steam refund should you not like it will it be worth the microtransaction you decide,pos

2007,early access reviewcrache constantly early access or not the game in it be current state be just horrible too bad though it get a lot of potential so would advice people to wait till actual release to touch this game in anyway to avoid frustration,neg
2008,early access reviewif you have not play this game yet go find a way to download it now it take what i love of super smash bros and give it a unique twist it be a great party game but it be as much fun climb through the ladder in rank this be a smash esque game where you actually want to have item on the lore be very well write i can really see this game be a big hit once it be open to everyone i would go into further detail describe all these point but i be sure many people have already do this in their review a couple suggestion though make the weapon pick up predictable there have be many time where i desperately want my hammer and i get an axe 2 3 time in a row i think change it so everytime you pick up a weapon it be guarnteed you will get the other weapon next time you pick up a weapon so essentially the weapon be on a rotation and you get that certain weapon every other time more gamemode in ffa i would love play brawlball stock and bombsketball with stranger i do not know how the matchmaking would work though maybe once the game be big the less desirable mode would not have that bad of a wait stance should be allow in matchmaking i have not see all of the stance so idk if some be ridiculously op be not but form what i have see they be balance out i be pretty sure there be really good reason why they be not in rank and what not but i think it would add an extra element to rank more of the daily mission i be sure you guy be go to add more mission but i just want to point out that i can not wait till that happen as a very casual player you could probably tell by my review thus far i like have goal to complete i would like them to be more advanced too idk what it will be but play as a certain character for 2 game in 1 day do not feel advanced enough maybe get a double kill as a certain character more thing to buy with coin do not get me wrong i do not want you to change any of the mammoth coin costing item into coin costing item i just want to be able to buy stuff with coin that be not character buy stuff with coin be a goal i work towards in game that keep me go as somebody that be consider buy the legend pack i be worried that i will not have anything to work up towards with coin maybe like profile picture or maybe you can unlock extra lore i do not need any of these suggestion in the game i be just brainstorm i would especially like for the weapon pick up not to be random though ever since pax i have be in love with this game and i can not wait to see what happen with it in the future thank for read d i hope this be helpful in any way,pos
2009,at the time of this review i have not put much time into the steam release of this game i have play it a lot on my phone from the pc bethesda launcher and windows 10 store this game be really good it start off slow but get well the more you play it it be a much well game than i think it would be from look at the trailer gameplay footage it have optional micro transaction but be not pay to win over all the version of this game i have never put any money in and i have more than enough cap dweller nuka cola bottle and so on i be stockpile resource on every version because the game without put money in give you more than enough of each the game have a lot more depth than i originally though it would and now you can also leave the vault and go on quest i highly recommend give this game a serious try and put some time in with it if you be a fan of the fallout game you will understand thing a bit more but i can image even a non fallout gamer enjoy this game in my opinion this game work really well with a controller but be far well with keyboard and mouse it be free so check it out,pos
2010,early access reviewi have try this game and it be actually great good thing about it it be similar to csgo with the keybinding and stuff rank system good aim and yea probably load of other good stuff bad thing when you buy the armor which give u 50 defense then buy 25 defense one you get the 25 defense one and lose 50 which should be fix imo u should either get 75 or a window appear say you already own this etc also when you die your weapon should drop and you have to re buy them from the shop make the game more challening and fun d although i know it be early access but still thank for me great game still,pos
2011,early access reviewvery fun game if only more people play it i can not get in any game due to very few people be online at a time there a few lag spike here and there probably due to my internet,pos

2013,as a player of smite since early beta i can definitely recommend this moba i find it be the good of its the good of its genre and have have hour and hour of fun with this game and with friend as the dev release new god it take a while before they balance them but eventually all the god in the game get balanced and ever single op god can get counter in some way whether its team composition playstyle or your character build this be hand down the most fun i have have with teamwork base game the community be good but with this now on steam i be not sure how that s go to change its only every so often you get troll on your team but if you be a more advanced player an easy fix be to play ranked match for the most competative experience most like feature gameplay game style the map be beautiful and the mechanic of movement and ability use be what make the game so distinct and fun most disliked feature loki isop you never see someone play bakasura unless its random pick and they get him this also go for a few other underrated godsoverall i find this game to be one of the good game for playability integrity and mutltiplayer if you be a scrub with no friend the game can still be enjoy 1 10 ign,pos
2014,i really do enjoy this game for a long time and its a really good idea of a game but the game be become somewhat of a pay to win when you remove the ability to get a new class in a game that s enjoyabe because of its variaty of class and only make them obtainable through in game purchase ruin the experience of the game,neg
2015,  i have around 80 hour in the game not nearly as many as other but i figure i would give the pov of someone that have never play the first planetside and be intrigued in play the second first off the developer of the game be superb they care about their playerbase they listen to feedback and they improve balance thing on a biweekly basis they recently have a huge optimization patch and i can say that i notice significant improvement to the game gameplay be apart of the game that i be not too particularly fond of but it can be fun if you find a group of people to play with solo play in a massive shooter like this will not be very rewarding unless you find a sweet spawn camp spot or somewhere that people be not hawk over to every 10 second i have find that with a group i have a more enjoyable time because i can get revive by friend and they can cover my back while play alone i have to watch my own back and sometimes random player that be play as a combat medic will not revive you for some reason user interface be always something i have to touch on as i be a ui designer myself for planetside 2 i feel they have do a great job refine the ui from what it be around beta release the attachment and certification system be much well than the original implementation and you can easily navigate through the ui to find what you be look for each of the icon on the bottom of the menu screen be precise in what they do so you be never fiddle around to figure out how to look at your weapon or view character progression or check out the station store each faction have different weapon that can be fully customize and have completely different high quality sound the weapon between each faction have different balance such as fast firing rate but less power or more power and less ammunition faction vehicle be also vastly different attribute that come into effect like speed firing rate rocket type etc all weapon and vehicle also have different camoflage color you can apply unique sound for all weapon and vehicle in the game really add to the immersion of be apart of the faction if you be vanu soverign your weapon be go to shoot little awesome laser beam that be for sure one thing that i feel be really lack in the game be the sense of community unless you be in a huge zerg squad you do not hear much communication over the voip and not many people talk in the chat mattherson server nc the community seem to really stick to their clan and do not really venture out to new player if you have question you may have to check the forum and even then if you post a question that be already answer you be in for some deep there be a lot of other aspect of the game that be great such as weapon vehicle customization instant action deployment resource system etc score gunplay 8 10gameplay 7 10monetization 6 10user interface 9 10customization 9 10sound design 10 10community 5 10,pos
2016,early access reviewi really like the atmosphere and the ability to control large capital ship so overall a fantastic space shooter that i have be look for however two thing i find lack on a first impression and limited play first off in general i feel it be too fast from combat itself to the speed and destruction of the large capital ship and second the large capital ship seem really undergunned for such a large ship frigate corvette and destroyer style ship should be quick and manueverable with limited option for weapon sacrifice heavy weapon and armor for manueverability and speed where as the large cruiser battleship and carrier option should be much hard to kill and have an assortment of heavy weaponry at the severe cost to speed and manueverability of course i only play about an hour so i may be miss some of what the game have to offer this be just first impression,pos
2017,  it may not be pretty but business tour be absolutely a work of art ign 10 10 masterpiece joke aside if you be look for a game to play with your friend from time to time and have fun this be your game p s it be pay2win and it have a lot of bug idc much about that tho,pos

2019,need some improvement to really be a high rate game what s good take apart and reassemble its not perfect the control be really wonky and instruction be not totally clear it be not always completely flexible either but still this part of the game be a lot of fun and as a gun owner it be fun to take apart the same gun i own in a game and see its interpretation of such what need improvement the shooting range it be god awful they could really borrow from arma 3 or aa for some more realisic shooting this feel like a cheesy arcade shooter and the recoil and ballistic be way off i realize that maybe its not to be take seriously but this game be go to invite gun nut like myself to play and when we go to the range portion its go to let us down i have to reaffirm these point because the game also presume to reach for your wallet at every turn want that next gun buy it with real money or grind exp for eternity want that other range yep pay up or grind its okay to ding around in with the free version for a bit but otherwise its not worth a long time play and if they want that much money they need that many improvement,neg
2020,early access reviewlevel progress be not worth anything anymore as you get a box with random stuff whatsoever not worth build a high rank robot anymore or more than 1 or 2 functional one no garage x2 bonus no hero bonus no chance to forge what you want to have if you do not have a huge arsenal from bevore the update do not bother start play this,neg
2021,early access reviewvery good game love it could use some work on the t pose issue but hey its an alpha its basically fortnite without the bs building which be why i would rather play this there be no solo but it will be release whenever can not wait for the game future pro fun awesome difference in a br type game for the class list and class item funny look when you get knock be a chickencon could use solo but we can wait could have give people certain color of the ray when you mark so you know who be who kind of like in pubg map marker could use a fix on some of the hit regoverall rank 8 5 10 for an alpha,pos

2023,the game be awesome when it start germans vs americans but it later go down the drain first there be the mighty german team but they be nerfe in a few month by some dev who think the americans should win before the nerfing i play around 460 hour but the nerf be the reason i quit i try to join later but they still want germany to lose this be the time the m1 g be buff and could one shoot at body shot with full hp at that time the player for germany be need the less damage upgrade to survive they then add russians whom at the start be destroy the buff americans and the nerfed germany at this time there be at most 80 germans play match then they nerfe america and the russian be buff later when i quit play and join back the iron sight of weapon such as svt gew m1 g kar mosin and m19 be nerfe the gun down sight be put further away and you could barely see where your reticle be after that the accuracy of semi bolt and rev weapon be nerfe so the rifle be become terrible a few day ago the game itself be have some player one shote people in the leg at full hp which i hope to hell the dev figure out but nothing have happen for a long while this be where i be now i notice they make the sound of foot movement quiter and the fully upgrade silent foot movement make no noise at all when walk so now you can not easily tell who be nearby even if you check map and right click the game be great starting but it be terrible near the end if i be to rate it at start it be 9 10 for everything but some map but now i rate it 2 10 for the terrible condition that be now in effect the graphic and map be well at the cost of the experience i would suggest play well ww2 game now but if you have a time machine go to the time the game be start because it be well then than it be now edit 1 also even if you do not have or do have a good pc the game will compensate by slow down the well pc game so the other terrible computer can catch up an example be when say you get in a gun fight your game may glitch out and a hint be you do not shoot where you aim when this happen so you be go to die i find out that there be no counter measure for spawnkilling so be careful or leave the terrible match btw i would suggest level all the country up at the same time cause if you get to gold level and you want to start a new character for a different country your new weak character be still put in top tier gold match so you end up get screw most of the time by mg sniper with sidearm or tank which you can not do anything to at the moment edit 2 spawn point for the assault map be terrible some of the map i suggest not play be mountain town town and forward airfield the terrible skirmish map be hill 60 and village skirmish both encounter map be great but once the battle be near an end the spawnkilling be unbearable important note when you die or use your gun you lose credit so try not be on a lose map say when someone pick your gun up you still lose credit for the use of that gun germany be know for well late game weapon tanks america be know for well rate of fire plane and russia be know for well damage infantry by the way the soldier skin be not share with each one and germany skin be more expensive than both america and russia german green pea can cost 790k for body and 107k for helmet american nagual can cost 352k for body and 97k for helmet russian palma cost 352k for body and 97k for helmet if you want cheap clothing go for america which at the least cost 30k for dark green body and 13k for dark green paint helmet or dark green cloth helmet which cost 35k america have the good tanker gun germans have the good recon gun and russians have the good infantry mg gun,neg

2046,i would highly reccommend this game because simply it be a load of fun what be great about it be that you can either play in arcade mode or in realistic and simulation mode for a great challenge new update every 2 month or so with new aircraft and vehicle to try out great for people with a low budget it be free who want to drive or fly vehicle from the second world war and early cold war although this be in my opinion a very fun and realistic game to play it have moderately slow update speed for me anyway and some player who be annoying if you wish to play the game properly and they be not also great for playing with friend,pos

2053,its okay but not great that s just it it have so much potential as a free to play game but you can not play free unless you be in a clan tradeing be limited and thus so be your ability to play free you can not buy krono if you be a free player and you can not sell thing on the auctionhouse to get the plat for krono if you can see past limitation and want a good game to explore this game be for you the craft system be a nice feature though the sound may put you to sleep as it be very relaxing overall the game be more of a 7 10 for what it have to offer but bear in mind that you can expect some pretty steep limitation if you just want to play free update i do not know what the hell happen but the game be now riddled with bug you be officially well off play runescape,neg

2055,early access reviewamazing game so far only one thing i dislike about solo be that when you kill an enemy they become a chicken in which they can run away and get self revive after a time limit of course like come on dude i already kill this guy why do i have to kill him in chicken form to get his stuff it just waste time i like the idea of unique class and ability and that other class can not use a different class ability also that in order to get lengendary item class weapon ability you have to go to a forge there be multiple forge on map in which can end up be a bloodbath because everone will want to go to the forge to craft stuff how do you craft stuff you collect shard by destroy duplicate or basically every weapon armor ability drop by other player in other word i already love this game and only have like 48 minute on it this be my dream game i have always want a medieval battle royale or at least something close to it this be fantasy battle royale there be still gun but they be like musket,pos

2074,  please give this a read so i have just take a peek at the review for this game to see if other have be enjoy it as much as i have and i be shock with all the negative there be a lot of the negative response i see be complaint on the fact that the game itself be not really free to play or that it be pay to win but you be play the full game you be just limited to what you can hunt which be mule deer now that do not sound like a whole lot and it really be not in comparison to what else the game have to offer but i spend a solid 3 hour straight tracking and hunt mule deer and have a blast i quickly realize that this game be well worth shell out some money for the terrain be gorgeous the way all of the animal behave be very realistic the tracking keep me very interested in the hunt and the overall experience be just amazing to those of you who be look for a free hunting game with lot of gun and animal to shoot i be sorry to disappoint you but this be not it the free part be just a demo really of the full game where you can hunt mule deer and get that taste but if you be look for a great hunting game and be willing to drop 30 40 buck on a bundle that give you 12 month of unlimited hunting a 12 gauge shotgun come with all different type of shot to hunt everything a new strong rifle with a new scope a 44 and 357 revolver some well camod clothe some call and a few other goody then this be definitely the game for you seriously if you enjoy the experience of just hunt the mule deer for a bit drop some money into it and go for the full experience it be really worth it this game deserve to be pay for 9 10 only because of microtransaction with all the rest of the item that do not come in a bundle but none of that other stuff be actual stuff that be need to enjoy the game and have the full experience,pos
2075,before i play lafter i play 7,pos
2076,early access reviewthis game be really well make very fun and offer an intense and spooky experience this game be great one of my fave game i have play recently i be so glad i hear about it and get to play it it say i only have 3 hour on record but i convince a friend to download it and i play the whole thing in one sit we all agree the style be great and be a game that should be try please play this fun and spooky unheard of until now,pos

2078,never get into arpg like diablo have not play a game like it there be quite the learning barrier when you first start up but thank god the internet exist overall it be enjoyable slashing and hack and use frost blading in a cone like projectile shoot and use a ghostly totem to wack those boss and mob i like it remind me of warframe when it be intense defense 50 round no stop,pos
2079,this game deserve more recognition it be just insanely good and the developer seem to care about it so far also the amount of stuff they give away for free be insane it be not for everyone since it be a moba and it be hard to learn to play but if you will get past the initial beating you will find in this game a very good game,pos
2080,early access reviewearly impression be wonderful custom game be even more enjoyable than the matchmaking rank seem to be really tactical in 2v2s only thing i hope to see in the future be large map each legend feel fairly balanced and can be counter with a few changed tactic i highly suggest gather friend up for nonsense hope to see brawlball get it be own queue at some point 3v3 brawlball would be pretty amazing worth a download if you enjoy smash bros or castle crasher,pos
2081,i have try lol dota and a few other mobas but i just could not get into the isometric click fest after have play the beta i give smite another shot when it launch 1 5 year ago and i never look back more than a 1000 hrs later i be still play every single day it will take you some time and practice to get use to it all but it be more accessible compare to other mobas due to it have less item and be able to turn on auto buy level positioning be a big part of be successful as well as aim timing communication and synergy make it hard to master the game be base on mythology from 7 different pantheon and the 69 god at the time of writing all have lore relate direct taunt which add a lot of humour to the mix 5 different class 8 game mode on 5 different map offer something to enjoy for everyone regular update and patch keep the game fresh with plenty of free gem event and sale you will not need to spend tonne of cash on cosmetic if you do not want to i have accumulate 1000s of gem and free stuff in my playtime be the 3rd big moba with 2nd large tournament prizepool in e sport history i think i can safely say hi rez finally hit the right spot with this game the only negative thing i can think of be that on a rare occasion the server lag and sometimes matchmaking can be a bit wonky which be not too big of a deal if you do not play ranked league as with any online game you get a few toxic player every now and then but they can easily be mute or ignore and more often than not you will find nice and reasonable folk in your match furthermore i can reccommend play queueing with friend once you get use to the 3rd person and aim turn off auto buy level and use site like tiermonster com for item build the bot in co op game mode be horribly bad get into pvp as soon as possible read some guide and watch stream to improve your game if you enjoy the game get the ultimate god pack unlock all god future god it be the good deal in moba games vvgl good luck vvgf have fun 9 10 would kappa again,pos
2082,early access reviewto be honest i be love the gameplay so much i be put off at first by the optimization use unreal engine it require me to read a reddit fix for the ini file and tweak some stuff but once i get over 30 fps finally i grow to love the game combat be well than expect and this be refreshing from bdo less grindy more quest and exploration pvp orient kinda about the jourey idk i be just have fun i bash it the first day along with everyone else but it be a decent game but they must fix the optimization issue quickly yesterday it actually remind me of when i first play wow the sense of awe i get from explore the scenery in this game,pos
2083,its boring i know its try to be relalistic but you walk at a snail pace and barely see anything special it all look the same so if you want to wait for ever for a second of action this be your game but its not for me i be pationt but this game get on my nerve but hey its free cough micro transaction cough,neg
2084,every time i try and log on it take me to the charecter creation screen and its a good and bad good because i can make a new charecter for free and get new dragon and bad because it do it every time i log off or try to switch charecter then the loading time it take take way to long for me to enjoy the game,neg
2085,after take a look at the negative review on this game regard it say f2p when they have a guest user system which be essentially their version of free user i do not see why you be all upset about this the system work perfectly with the game and despite many of you say you have to invest lot of cash to actually do anything you would be supprised if you take a look around their starter pack page and various retailer for the game key website amazon etc you can infact find ridiculously good deal for this title i will explain that further on i myself find the game to be one of the good hunting simulator i have play in a long long time the cabelas series honestly have be blow away by this title and the community as it stand be in excellent condition the game be regularly update and despite have a few issue in the past it be turn out to be one of my all time favourite game due to the fact that there be an unlimited amount of fun that you can have from have hunting competition with your friend to solo hunting in the dense forest or in the mountain peak the graphic and the game ballistic physics be clean and very well do despite have hiccup rarely with a few glitch they need to iron out you would be supprised at how much you can actually achieve within the game the achievement and reward system for competition and general milestone be another feature which add a sense of achievement to invest your hour into the game same with weapon skill and track spot skill level on to the weapon currency and customization within the game customization be somewhat limited due to the fact you can not swap camo on your weapon so the marketplace often have weapon of the same type but a different appearance but it do not really matter as they share the same skill stat aslong as they be the same model character appearance be another feature you can customize within the game by simply mix and match clothing to your desire with the wide range available it be really not that bad as well as you can swap out clothing on different enviroment condition or depend on what you be hunt to give well visibility and sound reduction stat currency em gm within the game be something you would definetly expect for a game of this type with a large multiplayer endorsement around the game i would not have expect anything less than the requirement to buy different weapon clothing and equiptment with the virtual currency which be perfectly understandable for this title and be implement well within the game em be the real world exchange currency where you purchase it use real world money or you can complete survey as an additional way of gain it for those who can not justify support the title through currency purchase gm be the free currency which you can gain through suveys again or by complete challenge or competition within the game however you can purchase limited thing use this currency honestly despite what you guy be say they should have no shame in call themselves a f2p game i have spend many hour within this game and spend what i would say be a fairly reasonable amount on addition for the game they offer a nice range of deal on their site for starter pack for the price of 15 you can get almost everything you would need to have a nice start to the game the 12 ga pump action shotgun include can hunt almost everything within the game you gain 3 month membership and access to hunt everything and travel anywhere as well as various other equiptment and a sidearm include i do not realise it before but i find various retail version of the game available on certain retailer website and despite already have a membership and a nice collection of weapon i go ahead and spend 14 on a retail key from link remove who offer a very nice retail package for this for the price of any regular game so what be the shame in call this an f2p game if they give you a variety of free option and then the ability to upgrade to a full version of the game with a membership starter pack retail copy for the price of any regular game it be perfectly justified and for those who be interested in that retail copy it be beyond belief what you get from it and i would highly recommend that to anyone interested in start or continue play this game it include 6 month membership 7 weapon 2 shotgun 2 sidearm 2 rifle 1 bow as well as access to everything within the game and another large assortment of equiptment and caller to get you start note one of the shotgun be an exclusive non market shotgun too weapon in the game be definetly very fitting for the title the developer have keep far away from unrealistic hunting weapon despite firearm such as ar 15s and semi automatic rifle be use regularly in real world hunting they have take the right desicion to not spoil the fun of hunt and keep it to a nice selection of rifle shotgun sidearm and bow they even add a muzzleloader for those who want a way back hunt expirence perfect match for a perfect game overall in my opinion the game be absolutely superb with it be stunning graphic unbeatable realistic physic and it be very well implement multiplayer community and feature definetly a 10 10 in my book and for those upset about the pricing of thing seriously check out the retail copy and the starter pack for the price of a regular game under 15 you can get everything you need to have endless hour of fun within the game hopefully this be helpful if not then i be not sure what you be expect from a review note over 100 hour on the non steam version felix b,pos

2093,early access reviewi can not believe how long i have be wait and keep an eye on this game i have be wait for a game that tick my box but sadly this be not the one the game look good have a huge map that be beg to be explore and i would have love to explore it combat be somewhat interesting and refreshing as well sadly this be all ruin by the fact that the dev can not get a working game to peform correctly the game have fail few time in the past yet here we be i get no clue of why they fail but what i do know be that if you fail you learn from your mistake here that do not seem to exist why bother throw out pack that give customer access to the game 2 day early before official release date when the server be wank fps be shockingly poor and load screen freeze make no sense at all i honestly feel sorry for the game fan and maybe dev but this be not right i be thankful that steam have refund me my money as if they would not then this would have be a cashgrab not only that but a user make a thread regard a duplication bug and it so happen to be the same one that exist in the previous version of the game i check with discord to see if this be true and one mod say that he or they be look into it sound like a yes to me tl drdo yourself a favor and click not interested as this game be a complete mess i can not believe i pay for a game and could not get in to enjoy it,neg
2094,early access reviewremember that time when you be play a game and think that this game need a lot more mindless action and fighting so now you have it and you do not even need to pay for it review legend the legend have repetitive weapon but each one of them have their own unique skill with them but unfortunally there as always those guy spamme spear rotation to not let you get back in the arena the legend be completly free o money you just need to play a lot to buy the one you want the game have a weekly rotation of legend so you can play with em all without even buy them arena the arena be kinda simple with some of them that actually have some feature or other the game itself get kinda of 7 8 arena but they all could get an upgrade and new feature all the arena be spear spamme friendly but with the right momentum you can just tell the sheethead to go away with a punch in his head skin the game give you the oportunity to have all the legend with only play the game but the skin just with mammoth coin translate real cash i kinda think this be good because you will only buy the one you like for the one you play but there should be another way to get them not like csgo with crate and sheet but kinda a presential month list that if you get all day ingame you could trade for a skin buuuut that s just me gameplay consist of the couch the single player the online and the rank the cool part of them all be not that you just play by yourself this game bring back the good old same screen co op gameplay meaning you can add more than 1 player in one pc for me this be actually awesome the game consist in kill everybody else in the arena be it in team or f4a free for all all legend have 2 weapon and can still just brawl their brain out with their fist end for all of you whom be reluctant to play this i shall tell you let freaking explode their brain with freak massive rocket spear 9 5 10,pos

2100,early access reviewthis be my first steam review and it be for a great game if you be look for a game to scratch that magic itch before arena come out look no further develop by some top mtg pro lsv chapin and it definitely show come from magic i love the combat and the power influence system there be thing in this game that could not be do with a paper card game like persistent effect in the void graveyard buffing card in your deck before draw them and steal unit end up in your void there be less opportunite to respond to action than magic but more than hs and it keep game move quickly it be definitely the most f2p ccg out there the game practically throw pack and gold at you if you keep up with quest and event they often have event in game that you break even in term of gold value without put up a stellar performance i have spend 25 on this game but it be only be for cosmetic item i do not even need to spend the gem real currency because i have more than enough gold and shiftstone craft currency to do what i want to do at the time of this review there be 3 set out and 2 campaign which be already a pretty good card pool with more on the horizon the development team of direwolf digital be great with their interaction with the community the initial tutorial be a bit long but they give you a nice stash of gold and base card to start with there be two ai mode that give pretty good reward one be a forge a draft lite experience you pick one of three card option and then be present with 3 more card and so on until you have a deck you keep all card from draft and forge no phantom draft here the other ai format be gauntlet where you play a deck of your choice through a gauntlet of ai deck with one loss end the run at the end of the run you fight a boss deck that have a specific gimmick that may benefit or hurt both player i e both player start with 3 power when you play a unit play a random weapon on it etc whenever i get burn out play pvp i like to reset with a gauntlet or forge run,pos
2101,good computer base cardgame to date this be what hs want to be before it degenerate down to a simple rng feast most game in tesl be very intense and the comeback mechanism with rune be just pure genious the fact you can actually grind together deck that be quite competitive in a week be just ice on a very good cake,pos

2111,the idea be great and truly unique but the execution be just so poor in this game app all you do be click and each time you do that you have to wait through a rather slow animation which also affect the camera which be annoying model be fairly detailed but low poly and they just look bad everything take forever not only progression and get new gun but also the process of strip the gun itself there be stupid bug like press the mag release will for some reason not release the magazine you have to click the bottom of the mag to take it out there be no physical fire mode switch you have to click a hover button to use that function additionally while strip gun you have to follow a non realistic path that the game force on you overall it be a nice idea but the game itself suck,neg
2112,early access reviewthis game be break when you have a flak you be op and when you be a low level you need to play so much game to finally get something good that be worth something when i open crate i get the cosmetic stuff that when i buy it it be worth 20k but when i sell it i only get 8 that be not right in my head i like the game a while ago so please make it like the old one or fix these problem,neg

2116,world of tank blitz the smash hit mmo tank game have take the mobile world at storm now before you make assumption about wotb its graphic be good but however with every good game come its up and down wotb with a bad wifi connection can reach up to 2455 ping which be exeptionally high not a good thing since that make the game respond much slow to your command at a time delay of around 2 6 second and that may not seem a lot but low ping be crucial espeacially when there be high tier in the match wotb consist of 2 team and 7 player each team the ussr and other country country which be currentley include in the game be ussr united states of america japan nazi period germany up to tier 9 in the medium tier anyway britain and other premium tank like the angry connor a scottish tank tank type tank destroyer a type of tank that do good damage but many be turretless heavy tank a type of tank that have great armour and can take a beat medium tank faster than heavy but weak damage and less armour but have fast reload speed light tank fast mobile and weak armour serve as a scout car summary at the end i would definetley reccomend this game and please like it if you do it really help,pos

2121,early access reviewi think people be highly go overboard with the negative review the game still in early access still be add to and adjust and some how in 1 2 day people think they know everything about it and that its problem will never get fix firstly i must say out of all the early access game i have play in the last few year this have be one of the well one if not the good only one or two maitenance on the first night no real massive downtime on the first day roughly about 2 hour all in all it be down for on the first night for maitenance so i think its do fine the game itself be quite fun there s a bunch of thing to do nothing that have not be do before but still a variety and it do not feel like a massive chore the combat be fun for a tab target game the combo system make it interesting i prefer this kind of combat to pure action combat because its not a a buttonmash fest and you have to think about what your use and how to utilise the stance to get the most of possible the problem atm be quite normal for any recently release mmo and i can deal with that it will get well with time only problem i have which be just a preference be that some class i want to play be not out mostly assassin but that s not much of a problem ill just get familiar with the game till its out another issue i would like to pick up on though this fail in other region and be a old game accord to some its be tweak quite a bit for us and they keep on tweak it just have patience i still feel like it have promise and i hope people give it a go because neowiz be actually really try as a company to live up to what people here want which be suprising since i can not think of many company who would actually go to the length they do to make this build of the game for us it be similar but at the same time very different to the other build it have in other region i hope it have a steady success and help people remember what mmo be for to have fun and enjoy the adventure be it pvp pve or other,pos
2122,first of all i would like to say that while there be certainly those who be more qualified than me to judge this game i feel i have play it enough and over a long enough time span to write an accurate review and yes i only get it on steam so i could review it mean that i have play for quite a bit long than 0 2 hour use the browser version next i give this a very tentative recommendation since this game be great for some and hell for other now for the actual review,pos
2123,early access reviewi really enjoy this game i spend entirely too many hour play this game over the past few year and i truly love it one of the thing that make such an amazing multiplayer game like this be a healthy relationship between the developer and their community freejam recognize this clearly because in the introduction to their product they make the claim robocraft have be build with a dedicated community of robocrafter from the very beginning unfortunately it seem like they recently replace someone within their company that have absolutely no respect for their community or have no desire to retain their exist player i be already extraordinarily upset when they remove megabot that be a big deal to me because i have 4 custom megabot which i spend countless hour build they be the game to me when freejam remove them read delete overnight i be shock after a week or so i get over it and rebuild some bot and resume play albeit a bit more reserved this late update take my disdain for change to another degree and completely remove my currency entirely both of them i have over 200 million rp and now it be go i have 20 worth of their premium currency save go my compensation for this loss be a crate which have some white block in it no apology no word of solace or anything which may remotely comfort me and bad of all no explanation in game the fact be these people have no regard for their community whatsover they further have no regard for their time or effort they simply do not care plain and simple they care about one thing money more specifically yours the individual reading this review debate about whether or not they should install it and give it a shot go for it install it love it build your dream robot and have a great time it be a really fun game unfortunately for me and thousand of other by the look of it i be do i have spend far to many hour only to have my effort toss aside with zero regard no consideration for their exist player i quit,neg
2124,take the same mechanic from other game like clicker hero and add some wonky battle formation mechanic which ultimately do not matter that much because it be an idle game all individual eventually just turn into a dps bucket of damage over time so you be just leave with a clunky interface need a lot of ui slimming quest be not meaningful they be just some text and a kill so many x or collect so many y which be not functionally any different than just kill a set number of enemy every level,neg
2125,product receive for freeearly access reviewthis game be a really nice twist on the moba genre i personally do not like mobas but with this twist it work really well i have see the development change and evolve and the developer be work hard to make the game great and improve their product definitely reccomend,pos
2126,its a grate time killer i get so scared after 4 hour of try to find something a bear come up to me like hi its not a scary game but when its so peacefull u do not expect anything to pop up p,pos
2127,  note my playtime on steam do not reflect the many hour i play on my phone so i see a lot of negative review on the game and i do understand where they be come from but to be fair this be originally a mobile game and most of the problem that be pointend out come from the fact that it be a mobile game to get straight to the point do i recommend hell yeah if your a fallout fan and hungry for some extra fallout content definately go for it its even free and really by all mean try it out cause its not a bad game at all if you have play mobile game before you will aprreciate that it be one of the gem in astorm that be the google play store for a more detailed overview here be the pro conspro its fallout decent vault managing content nicley polished fallout style graphic lot of loot and equipment not a pay to win con quest line can become repetitive quick no strong story line or dialogue tread in grey area difficulty drop pretty fast can take long to perform upgrade or craft now with all of the above be say i would like to point out that some of the con be quite inevitable for a mobile game no strong story line or decision make dialouge for this i have to say i do agree that life or death decide moral decision will spice up the game a lot but you have to take into account that this be f2p people spend cash to get there rare equipment or dweller imagine thestorm the dev will have to go through confront angry player who have there cash item disappear to an ingame event the main fallout game can give you difficulat decision cause you have a savegame to fall back too plus if you up you can always start a new game with out have to pay extra for anything can take long to perform upgrade or craft its a mobile game guy people who play mobile game usually do not spend hour to play a game in one sit they usally play while on break while they go home during lunch etc the hour do not matter to much because they spend most of that wait time to do what they do plus the game be not a public service the dev need money to create new content upgrade speed boost be a good way for them to monetize the game you can hate on microtransaction all you want but this game have one of the more reasonable microtransaction scheme i have see in year for a mobile game plus for fallout shelter the pay be really just for time reduction there be no pvp element so your not missingout on anything even if you do not pay quest line can become repetitive quick difficulty drop pretty fast these two i actually have to admit be probably the big flaw of this game even consider the fact the dev can not really throw you difficult decision the questline available be very bland just to be fair i think the dev decide to add the quest content as an afterthought because it dindt exist at launch for the difficulty it get really easy pretty quick the raider death claws roach become easy to repel soon enough and serve nothing much than a minor annoyance in the later game occasionally fire may breakout in the vault but that be also a minor issue until the dev introduce some new threat and new building after you build up your vault 100 dweller it will get repetitive that s pretty much all i have to say about this game it have a fair share of flaw but if your a fallout fan its deffinately worth check out it may serve as a good filler in between your long journey in the mohave and capital wasteland 8 10 will send dweller out again for population control,pos
2128,my h play say everything about this game enjoyedit i change my mind i m not support this game anymore cuz his abusive moderator they have in the forum they delete every post they personaly do not like it so until dev of this game teach and keep in leash some mod i l not play support anymore this game support money,neg
2129,early access review generous in term of card acquisition marvelous deckbuilding in term of design and creativity it can allow broken combo and you need a lot of expensive card sometimes but quite cool in the game you can have up to 4 copy of each card per deck still i say it be really free to play automacic mulligan you can keep it or draw a full new hand a little frustrating and not in your hand resource mechanic sigil a k a as mana land etc in other game be kinda broken magic style not horrible but somehow annoying you can have 8 resource card and nothing to play or the opposite easily it be early access but it be a desing flaw they should fix the only signigicant flaw i can notice be the same as before where build a deck be certainly a very fun and interesing experience play it be not a lot more than click avaiable card for your turn and keep a couple of reactive spell in hand i learn quite a bit about deep mechanic and the game have a lot a lot of super powerful combo wich make even big the feeling of only one person destroy the other either you or your opponent this make the resource system somehow not that big of a problem but still frustrating sometimes still it be worth a try in my opinion but keep in mind deckbuilding be very deep and fun and actualy play be as hard as say the alphabet it have a gaunlet mode wich be like a versus ia arena you can enter for free and earn some card and gold so i would recommend try it a little bit,pos
2130,well i have to be honest and i do not think i have ever write such an entirely negative review if you pay attention to a lot of aspect of this game you realise that the developer probably do not care very much i know this sound harsh but i will explain why i think this the game itself be entirely generic to be honest you go into town and get gun and food you try not to die to player and zombie issue with the way the game work melee weapon be all the same range despite their model brass knuckle to polearm like weapon they all have the same range not to mention some of the model be entirely break the shiv be entirely invisible with no model at all as well as one of the other weapon entirely lose it be tip when it be jab at thing melee weapon have one attribute damage that be the only thing to them other than look and i be fairly certain they all attack at the same speed not to mention the very good melee weapon you can get do not work propperly and will miss the opponent often enough that it be not usable at all see as you will take damage use it because enemy will not be stun by your hit skill tree not only do this skill tree only have a handful of skill they be entirely generic if you be look for a unique character compare to other people character you will not have any luck that be not even the end of it if you want to be a melee base character prepare to also be force to invest point into sniper base trait not to mention these benefit be so tiny that you will not notice them you will also question if they even code it correctly and the trait work in the first place as they do not tell you by how much they will increase your ability path 2 survivalist which make you not need to eat as often or drink as often which without the perk you will never have a problem with ever you will not even have to pay attention to your food and water value even after play for hour on end path 3 health and stamina increase path path 4 super expensive exp wise give you pretty sizable increase to damage and double stamina etc point be do not expect anything special silly random thing like a wooden baracade make a c4 explosion sound when it break and alert everyone in the area of your presence despite all this i do have some fun play it it be free and i have a lot of laugh with my friend at all the glitch like have to jump over a curb because you can not step over it during an intense zombie chase the one thing that i really like about the game be that they have ton of gun i have honestly never see a game with so many gun do i think this game could ever become more than it be now no to be honest it be a very generic premise i do not want to see another game with such low effort conceptually i know it be a free game but they be obviously make a lot of money off of this since this be their second itteration of the game which they do not change barely anything between the game seriously i have play both it be the same game map be the same zombie model almost everything not an exaggeration it just boast slightly improve graphic to the developer please find someone with an imagination you do not have it i give the game 1 10 ps survival mode be a complete mess where you will not see food or water spawn and you can not drink out of the large body of water no special skill tree for survival expect to see 40 gun or melee weapon before see a single food or water item survival just be not a fun experience because it be balance poorly,neg

2142,i love creativerse i have not play in age as i be typing i be instal i play creativerse a while back and it be great i can not judge minecraft over creativese there both cool game but in creativerse there be a lot more thing to do also i like the way you add dlc pack so people can buy them to unleash lot more fun into the game,pos
2143,early access reviewdo not install this gamethis be a mediocre game on its own but it act like a virus once its on your pc i try delete it through steam and the launcher stay and redownloade the game then i use the control panel to delete it and the launcher redownloade the game again now it open itself when i start my pc and continually redownload itself my computer tell me the game and the launcher do not exist but they keep redownloade themselves do not install this game,neg
2144,early access reviewnote i have many hour outside of steam as well although it look like a minecraft rip off on the surface once you start play you will realize that it be its own game not all sandbox game with square be try to be minecraft especially this one the graphic 7 5 10ye the graphic be really nice to look at along with the animation the world come alive much more than many other game include minecraft however with all that be go on nearly everything be animate it can get a bit laggy just because your pc can run game like grand theft auto v at 60 fps on high graphic do not mean you can run this game on high graphic i know this firsthand i have all my setting set to minimal i can barely tell the difference between max and minimum graphic visually but it do effect my fps overall really nice graphic and animation but it need to be optimize for minimal lag the ui control 9 10the user interface be fantastic all around it be not the same bare bone ui you would expect in early access game i see you over there ark but be instead detailed and elegant it could use some improvement sure but for early access the ui be really nice and self explanatory the control be somewhat familiar if you have play minecraft there will not be a huge learning curve wasd and mouse button be the same as in minecraft it have more control actually and it still do not seem overwhelming even on your first time play the gameplay 8 5 10like most sandbox game when you load up a world it do not tell you what exactly you need to do you start off explore play with the control and see what there be to offer eventually as you explore you will find a craft table once you find that it become self explanatory find this craft this build this do this it be not confusing however do not mistake this for the game be linear it be not linear at all you can take your survival in many direction unlike many sandbox survival game you have a single do it all tool that come attatche to your character and you simply have to upgrade it to break new type of block this make the game less confusing but may even make it too simplistic however overall the game be quite self explanatory but in a fun way you will not run out of thing any time soon and if you do the multiplayer your world be server when you create a world it become public on the list of world people can search for the name of your world and try to join it you can password protect the world or make it so those who join can not edit the world but anyone can view your world by search the name of the world this make multiplayer with friend extremely easy you simply tell them the name of the world and password if you set one they search it and they can easily join it be fantastic there be also a wide range of administrative tool for your world and setting to make your experience easy or more difficult the community 10 10fantastic community the dev reply to my problem within hour and the community be equally ready and happy to help this be not an immature community the problem there be no chat in the game even if multiple people be online in the same world it require a fairly update graphic card there be a good chance you will need to do some updating of your driver it can lag even on great pc need some optimize i be a little worried about it become free to play at launch i fear the microtransaction overall 8 5 1010 10 would kill leaf creature with a twig again,pos

2147,early access reviewthis game have have its upp and down but the fact thet they be try to fix it for us show promise people have be bash the game for personal reason more then anything but like any game it will have its critic instead of assume what the game be about why not just play it for yourself i do and fall in love with the game the current state be ok and have proble but the overall game be so much fun that i just do not stop play and do not plan to stop anytime soon,pos
2148,i like elsword even if it feel a little dated be the game as an anime style mmo side scroller beatem up or a side scroll beatem up with mmo element well i can not decide but you may be able to if you try it its fun you may just find yourself hook a note though be that as of this review the game be have all sort of issue launch from steam you can download it with steam but then you will most likely need to launch from the game exe 3 18 14,pos

2150,i can not say i recommend this which honestly make me feel down as i quite enjoy the series movie and original book however the massive amount of lag render this game unplayable and i be not over exagurate about that i literally could not even register because it be lag so badly it take 5 minute for my mouse to move to the register button this game must be horribly optimize or have some kind of basic issue like that because i be capable of run game like subnautica with little to no issue and i can not even get into this game also from my perspective on the menu i see advertisement for at least eight different pay to get pack and whilst that normal for an mmo this one be targette toward child 5 and under which make the whole thing rather sketchy in my book not to mention the obvious fact that it be not free to play if everywhere you look the game be ask for you to pay to get this that or the other,neg
2151,product receive for freeearly access reviewi use to love this game dev of hero and general if your reading this the game would be much more enjoyable if everything in the game 50 off it take week just to get a lmg or a pistole so please make a change and stop make dumb vehical to hide the truth,neg
2152,alright first thing first i have clock about 200 hour on the steam version and roughly 300 on the mobile version i have play this game a lot this be and eld scroll card game it play well and be somewhat balanced in no way be this game pay to win but you can buy the expansion which be quite fun that will add card to your collection that be only obtainable through say expansion you can either pay for them with in game currency or with money the base game be pretty straight forward the campaign be good and there be some story behind it and since its base on the elder scroll if you like the lore you should enjoy the nod it provide now for the expansion dark brotherhood it be fun add some challenge and have an interesting story overall worth pay real money for clockwork city this be an interesting change for the neutral side of the game add a variety of card that can really make have neutral card other than meta card useful i recommend buy with money but in game currency work as well puzzle now these can be quite difficult and brain tease fun to complete but no replay value to them this one do not give you direct access to certain card but card pack i recommend buy this one with in game currency rather than money as the price be not justifyable now on to why i do not recommend the game i will not lie its still one of my go to game to play on my phone and something to kill time but the playerbase be dwindle and you will be able to find match easily but it feel super rig from time to time you will often find yourself in situation where it will give your opponent every single top deck card they need and you do not have a single answer for anything you can often tell from the first 5 6 turn whether or not its go to be a how or not but this be not concrete and you can have some epic comeback the game be balance exceedingly well before the house of morrowind update now that you can have 3 attribute 75 card deck they be often more or less t and annoying to play against some card feel extremely broken though they can have an answer to them if you do not waste your useful card and be often just not fun to play against they add too many new card in one swoop and it throw the meta and average game into a weird place most deck create prior to the expansion feel obsolete and not viable when play against people with seemingly random deck with the new card their slogan be you tired of lose to rng be laughable at good there be quite a few card in the game that be completely rng base and its a card game its go to be rng anyways luck of the draw you can absolutely get decimate by rng in this game and its very annoying seem more prevalent after house of morrowind the last two month of the game do not reward a new card and only give in come currency and card pack for the ranked reward i get they may be run out of idea but i like the fact that a new card be be add at least once a month balance pass seem quite rare and tend to nerf a lot of go to set up card and card that be just really useful in general overall the game be fun but very aggrivating once you have put time into the game and have skill you will never be guarantee a win until the last turn of the game and you can not go into any match expect to win either keep that in mind,neg
2153,after a a 10 minute registration and the 2hour download i get into the game where there be no fov so i feel like i be play through a 2x microscope and to be able to control your car be impossible in itself there be no video setting either i give this a 0 25 100 not reccomende,neg
2154,this game be a mixture between world of warcraft and diablo it play like world of warcraft with the same viewpoint same looting system and gameplay etc ie do pvp gain glory in order to buy pvp gear do heroic dungeon to get epic gear at max level but it then have a diablo twist with the same style gear system and ability system where you have a limited number of spell and you have to choose the good build love the game so far and play 70 hour i would recommend to everybody,pos

2160,dcs world be a great sim however it do have a huge learning curve for those who like the hard core sim where every buttion and switch be model in the aircraft look no further lucky for people who be not so hard core there be the flame cliff 3 module although this module still take a bit to figure out how to use the plane some you tube vid and some button mapping to a good quality joystick and dogfighting be a blast fc3 add the f15c su 27 these plane be pretty easy to fly you do not have to pull 20 switch to fire a cannon after play a bit in fc3 and finally get the hang of radar and beyond vis fight i find dcs fc3 to be and enjoyable and challanging sim dodge heat seeker by drop flare and pull hard 7 9 g turn only to have the missile pass beneath the belly of the aircraft by a factor of meter be such a rush and then win your first airvictory and then your first combat sortie be somthing that instill a sort of pride in you tl dr dcs world module like a 10c black shark 2 and other stand alone plane be more suited to the hard core player even though there be a game mode it be not very well explain fc3 with a small amount of learning can be a rewarding and fun module for the sim junkie ps look up youtube tutorial as they tend to explain how to use the system better i find this one help alot with the f 15 however do not try to learn it all at once you will not reamember and become frustrated,pos
2161,early access reviewreally great game build your own robot and fight with them the 11 different teir offer both upgrade to your current weapon armor sheild and mode of transportation as well as introduce new one as you advance through each teir the game have really good balance and you will be hook from the get go i would also like to add that while there be micro transaction they be entirely unnececary as all they have for offer be either cosmetic item or a premium membership which double the money and experience you earn both of which can be gain quite quickly without it,pos

2165,to fully illustrate what make dota one of the most compelling multiplayer game of all time it help to have a bit of background on the game itself dota have its root as a warcraft 3 modification warcraft 3 introduce a unique mechanic in its campaign and multiplayer mode of hero unit unit that actually gain experience point ability and item as the game progress this really make it feel like you have an investment in these unit and you grow attach to them to a degree these hero unit effectively commander of your army of relatively disposable unit become your avatar in game it be a brilliant concept and dota take it a step further dota create a multiplayer mode that focus exclusively on play these hero unit it remove the base building and unit management see in the standard rts format it be one of the good example of less be more than i have ever see and that description hardly do it justice manage your individual hero and your income position on the map constant decision making and be able to size yourself up versus your enemy bring more depth than any other game i have ever play i have yet to play any other multiplayer game where every member of your 5 man team be crucial to your victory everyone must do their part and do it better than the other 5 man team there be very few case of where a game can be winnable 4v5 and teamwork become a huge factor in the most intense and close game the level of immersion really can not be match it be hard to think of another game that draw you in more than dota especially when other people be count on you to do well it be a hectic stressful enormously complex and in depth experience not to mention absurdly fun this be what keep me come back and i would recommend it to anyone look to really experience what multiplayer gaming can truly offer if you be new to the game and want some background on specific hero and strategy or just want to watch some gameplay be sure to check out my youtube channel thank for read,pos

2188,i find fallout shelter to be an amazing game just do not use your money to buy anything like ever i spend 30 on my game and have weapon for everyone everything be perfect then out of nowhere invincible molerats overrun my shelter i pause and google if pay for object and such carry out between save but sadly they do not i waste 30 on this game just so i could be easily overrun it be basically like me spend 29 99 for the game but once you lose you lose the game too this be the only reason i do not recommend this game i strongly disapprove that they be lock to specific save especially consider the fact i spend my hard earn real money oh you lose thank for playing please insert another 29 99 it be like a sick overly expensive arcade machine that instead of quarter cost 29 99 and you do not get 3 life nope just one lose it and you have to pay an arm and a leg just to start over this happen a couple month or so ago but just now decide to rate it final conclusionif you play this do not spend any of your money on this otherwise a great game,neg
2189,the good game on steam above all else if you do not already own this game or intend on play it i suggest you literally just shoot yourself here and now this game contain next gen graphic and gameplay with amazing mutliplayer potential the fishing and farming simulation be second to none and becasue of this the game second as a solid alternative to either the game farming simulator or fishing simulator i definitley prioritize play this game to either study house work or even get a job due to it be amazing feature with not a single bug 10 10 would deeply reconsider what the actual i be do with my life and also reconsider all of my life choice again,pos

2191,early access reviewi can not understand how anyone who do not want to use extensive amount of money to buy weapon and equipment can stand to play this game you have to grind for age to get level and ribbon in order to be able to buy anything even after be able to unlock something the ingame money cost be abyssmal unless you like to grind with meh equipent at the beginning of the game be prepare to use your wallet to achieve anything i want to like this game i really do but all these obstacle design to frustrate you into use real money take all the enjoyement away,neg

2194,fallout shelter be a free to play management game with quest combat and baby make everything be very easy to learn and pick up and all of the different activity be more than enough to keep one occupy the vault dweller the character you control all work very smoothly and offer some humorous comment or easter egg from time to time my only gripe with the game be that it will get stale after a while but before then you should be able to get in plenty of time to enjoy all of the various action and event fallout shelter have to offer 10 10 really worth give it a try,pos

2206,i start play this game on the 15th of august 2012 and little do i know that this game actually would be the most important game i have ever play in my life it have give me so much but storytime later this be my review of the game every 2 week they give out a new patch which shaken up the meta balancing and adjust god item and maybe change some of the ingame elemental on the map and i believe every month there be a new god to learn to play and counter it freshen up the game every time there be 5 class hunter guardian mage assassin and warrior every class design for a different role adc carry support mid jungle or solo however it do not lock the class to their design role usually you would want hunter for your carry and warrior for solo but it do not say an assassin or guardian do not work for solo or a mage for carry it be all about your playstyle and how your team could work as a team and make the composition work every game be different for sure there be alot of playmode aswell you have conquest the standard moba map with 3 lane a jungle and alot of objective this be the most competative playmode and also the one where professional play be involve with smite esport be amazing to look at especially if you enjoy play the game and want to see some really good team play against each other with different practice tactic then you have the casual gamemode such as arena as the name state you be basically just brawl out in a big circle with 3 different buff on each side teamfight and kill be what this mode be for but you have to watch the minion assault be also here where everyone get assign a random god there be just 1 lane and you can not go back into base and buy item unless you die which also put your team in a disadvantage for some second until you return strong to lane however be alive for too long put you at a disadvantage all random all mid this be also obviously the most unbalanced gamemode where your team can lose by just the god you be assign with but hey this be make for casual fun and play god you probably normally would so why would you play assault if you be just go to complain then there be clash the mix between arena and conquest which be 2 lane a huge buff monster in the middle and some sidejungle with a mana buff quite fun but also just really a cluster of switch between lane and outplay the other team the last casual only gamemode be siege which also be two lane and have a big siege monster in middle which be assign to the team that get the killing blow on it this have alot of hp and bring down tower quickly a quite fun gamemode where it be not 5v5 as most other gamemode but there be 4v4 there be also motd or match of the day to touch on where balance be out and there be a new gamemode on rotation with different twist then you have the semi competative gamemode with both casual and rank involved which be joust and duel duel be a rank only 1v1 gamemode where you ban out god you do not want to play against and it be only you to outplay the enemy 1 lane with an objective to turn off the tower and two buff mana and attack buff it be all about outplay joust be nearly the same it be on the same map but it be 3v3 so you alongside two ally play against 3 other to see who come out victorious this game have so much to offer ton of amazing skin and a really great community both on famous smite player on twitch twitter and aswell with reddit and some group on facebook honestly just all around the good moba out there to me atleast because it be indeed a 3rd person wasd movement base moba this game have give me friend over the entire world and i even go from norway to usa to live at some guy house for 2 week all because of smite thank smite for everything you have give and this be definitely my all time favorite online pvp game,pos

2213,at first this seem really cool before i download it then after spend an hour or so i find it to be a total drm p o s i mean you have to friggn be online just to play this thing wth every time you want o play disassemble assemble a gun the game have to redownload the model why suppose you live where the internet conenction be bad or your camping and want to goof off after a long day hike on your laptop noooooo even the shooting range be limit cause it be only for one kind fo gun you can pick the kindof shooting range you want choose whatever gun you want and start pop off shot no it be whatever they want to give you and only a small fraction of gun get to be use in the shooting range the game be constanly tell you how much more exp you could have earn by buy a booster pack and even fork out 40 do not unlock every item good thing i only get the free version disassembly be dumbe down too oh sure some model require you to remove every screw but only for that region even then most gun assemble disassemble as an assembly mean a group of part com apart at the simple click of a button i really do not feel like you learn much texture range from realisic to flat out lazy the ak and 1911 be very pretty but gun like the tech 9 sport few convincing texture especially the barrel assembly the game go so far as to tell you you can unlock any gun at any time if you pay money while the multiple x ray mode attchment be cool there be really nothing redeem about this at all if i be to actually get a copy that do not require the internet to even use and still require money to buy i would may consider it but inthe end it be really a modern day corrupt app and i do not are if the dev say well we want to preven piracy to heck with that noise this exact philosophy be what make sooooooooooo many gamer tick off about the original feature of the x box 1 so why bother with game like that at all i do not care if this be more of a simulator than a game i care about integrity and i find this game to stink to high noon with questionable business practice real gamer do not need their wallet to unlock feature nay sayer can go suck a lemon,neg

2218,disregard all of the scathing review for the new look because while i be also not the big fan of the new look and what not i would like to talk about the actual game you dinguse and you know what it be still a fun and balanced card game it be a free to play game that honestly do not feel pay to win in the slight sure the gold grind be a little rough but there have to be some engouragment to do in game purchase to be fair speaking of gold you can buy a deck with a theme like aludin dragon parthunaxx shout for about 500 which i reckon be possible after about 12 hour of somewhat grind and you will be pretty set after that or at least have a nice place to start want to also give prop to the campaign they be neat little story that give pretty great reward the downside be that all except the default story come in 3 act each cost 1000 gold each for a grand total of 3000 gold to play through a whole campaign oof lastly i would like if the arena see a bit of a change or ticket for it be more common without a ticket it cost 150 to enter a good run where you completly beat it all will probably give you around 125 gold huh also i do not like how rng it be your deck rng the special rule rng but be usually something that benifit the opponent all in all a solid expiernece for peep who like card game or be thirst for elder scroll content lore also it be free just give it a whirl dude,pos

2226,early access reviewthis be a great game eternal be pretty much slightly simplify magic the gathering that feel like more like hearthstone in term of gameplay speed you can easily pay for card to get your collection go but the reward system be generous with handout as well if you be a twitch prime member you also get a nice infusion of card pack as of 9 1 18 which be very helpful i end up buy gem for the campaign chapter which i normally pay for in any card game i play online but it look like you can grind gold to pay for them as well rng can be frustrating at time give you only resource card and then give you no resource card while give you only one mulligan but such be life eh give it a try it be free,pos

2234,elsword be a whole lot of fun if you be into fighting game the game have an interesting cast of character and very very many choice regard moveset and playstyle the game skill system be expansive and sometimes seem too big but i be an indecisive person so i just have to deal with it the core game mechanic be wonderful and the ability to chain combos off of one another almost flawlessly be incredibly gratify the equipable weapon and armor system be interesting but it can get very annoying to micromanage and the sheer amount of item and number to consider can be a turnoff one major complaint i have be that the game seem to be center around these event that keep you play the game will give you the opportunity to find these crazy item and equipable armor or weapon which be awesome and all but you can lag behind a lot if you miss an event in short the game struggle heavily with power creep they keep ramp up the power of these exclusive weapon and item so that you can be even strong if you get the stuff from this event and the cycle continue as the stat go higher also the item drop can get flat out ridiculous for instance on my main character i accumulate over 1200 complete recovery potion those thing restore all your hp and mp what the hell this basically make me unkillable in any dungeon of my level which make the game cool for a little bit but boring and trudge after a while overall though i would recommend it,pos

2237,early access reviewthe good multiple soldier class to choose from mean multiple play style to utilize and select from separate resource for soldier and assault team the ability to rank up your soldier and their individual weapon skill to specialize them how you wish the ability to unlock more powerful gear and vehicle by invest time and experience into the previous level the ability to unlock and choose a perk for your soldier in combat such as fast reload reduce damage take and carry more ammunition three nation to choose from allow different gear between faction with few exception each soldier can earn more for fight base on their rank provide an incentive to continue to improve and rank up the ability to give a general gear to other soldier of the same faction once say soldier become a general the bad each soldier start with no experience base gear and must play through the same tutorial to start earn credit in battle just by play experience gain be painfully slow with gain and reward become more insignificant over time until they start become not only more miniscule but more time consume as well each experience tree not only unlock different perk but different item and do not intersect often hold new item in the middle or later stage of the tree each nation unlock different thing in different order mean some nation will be able to unlock well equipment at different point such as tank at least one soldier must reach the rank of field officer before you can participate in the general part of the game unless you purchase a general or high rank soldier use real world cashall weapon vehicle class and assault team can be purchase use real world currency the only exception be ribbon level and perk which can be unlock faster use booster or a premium accounteach player be thrust into match with high level player randomly upon reach rank 3 with one soldier mean they often face off against vastly superior enemy very early on even the balanced match be not

2241,tf2 be a casual free to play first person shooter on its own that do not really translate to much but with a wide variety of game mode incredibly high skill cap and diverse class with a variety of weapon to cater to a large amount of playstyle tf2 do stand out as be a cut above the rest balancing unfortunately be not as strong as it could be and there be a few legitimately overpower weapon and not all class be equal in usefulness however with the lack of cash shop base game stat and the default weapon generally be the most versatile and reliable in the game on top of the skill cap of the class keep in mind the casual nature of the game any issue with balance be minor enough that it can be work around through player skill and team coordination their business model only require a single item to be purchase from the in game store or to be gift a premium upgrade package at which point any cosmetic weapon or upgrade can be find through play the game craft or purchase through in game resource it be a very fair game with one of the best free to play model in the market the primary difficulty you will find with the game be start it with a lackluster tutorial un cordinated public game and little assistance in the relatively deep tactic and game mechanic for the various class it can be hard to become skilled enough to coordinate in solo play play with friend and do some research into the game be highly recommend as tf2 will not do it for you tf2 on it be own be highly mod friendly and have a variety of community make server run custom game mode with a bit of search you can find hangout mini game training server custom map unofficial weapon and the like on top of the official game and fairly friendly community it be not especially difficult to get hundred of hour of enjoyment out of the game without any issue or requirement to invest money it have its problem but ultimately they be minor what tf2 offer be a rich fps experience with enough community support to satisfy a variety of taste so i have no issue recommend this game to any fps fan look for a team focus objective base shooter,pos

2243,early access reviewme at launch i like this game it be a unique vehicular base shooter where teamwork and communication be the key to success sadly this game be fill with 10 year old but even without communication its a cool time killer you get to design your vehicle fairly easy and its pretty cool that everyone have a different machine add a large amount of diversity to the game to get cube to build your vehicle you earn a currency during match that you can buy cube with and you unlock more cube with a different currency there be another currency that cost real money but it buy the same thing as the f2p currency and a couple cosmetic but that be it a very fun game me later ok they change the game a little bit in way i do not really like but it be still an ok game you still have the f2p currency and the p2p currency but now you do not need to unlock the cube it make it so someone can take a super op gun and put it on their tiny vehicle and it get group up with the weak vehicle with 20 very weak gun it do not matter how small the op vehicle be because it kill anything that it see instantly there be also now a community market which allow people to post their creation and other people can download them if they pay for all the cube that it cost to build it a cool sharing system but now people can just download the very well build vehicle which mean now there be no creativity or diversity in most match when 5 people have the same op vehicle a pretty t update if you ask me but the game be still all right i guess me now this game it ing suck now there be no f2p currency nothing now we have ing crate oh wow so unique ing crate you can get all the cube you could have buy before by play the game but now you get very very very much less oh you spend the entire match heal a guy who be defend the base and pretty much save your team from annhilation oh here you can have the bad chest in the ing game that give you 20 corner block so now you be ed because when you be try to build a unique vehicle have fun build it out of corner block meanwhile the guy you heal the entire match get 20 kill and get the good crate in the game so while you have corner block that selfish have a heat seek rocket launcher oooorrrrrr you can spend 20 and have all the cool stuff and win the game so yea do that freejam freejam more like paytohaveachancejam do your self a favour and never play this game in this state if they fix thier game they probably will not i will change my review have fun hopefully play a different game,neg
2244,  this be my review of this game for starter the game be about ww2 where you pick faction in early game the soviets the germans and the ally us each faction have pro and con for what i observe it be a free to play game make by reto moto the game itself be fun wide map you have opportunity to become a pilot tanker recon or a general itself please do not be like those bad general if you become one like the map have no car bike etc as a new player of the game you will have an infantry as a starter character of the game if you play us you will have m1 garand which have good sight in my opinion if you play germany you will have g43 or gewehr 43 which have good precision when not aim if you play soviets you will have svt 40 it be a flexible gun now here come the new player life as a new player you will be on bronze tier and will be on encounter match this be the good part when you try to understand the game mechanic use this opportunity to understand the game just my advice you will be verse with bronze skill till silver skill then gold once you have hit the gold tier welcome to the bad part of the game q why be it bad when you be onto gold skill tier a as a new player you will be just run use bicycle use civilian truck and you will be get camp by recon or infantry with bolt action rifle 1 hit this part will irritate you the most a the second bad be that tank with he shell spawn camp you be grateful if one of your teammate be anti tank psycho a the third bad part the plane will destroy you if they see you run in the open my advice if they have fighter plane heavy fighter plane and you do not have a car go run in the forest area or a place where keep you hide with shadow a the fourth bad part be that once you be onto cap zone enemy who have heavy set badge will be hard to kill because heavy set badge reduce damage and you be just use your tiny cute stock tier 1 gun and you will be the one who get kill first because they have well gun than you a the fifth bad part for you you will be verse with insanely good player in some game the matchmaking have skill callibration where you get to your own skill tier and this game have do not q why i do not recommend this game a the game be way too grindy this make you pay a real dollar into a pixel money sound stupid but that be the reality of this game i prefer to grind in an different mmorpg game than to grind in this game a reto or the game company do not listen to the community opinion they just make new bs plane new gun they should improvise the map with weather and the infantry character for me once you get your 1 hit gun mgs badge car plane tank good assault rifle then the game start to be fun let me tell you if you want to enjoy be tilt trigger or become a masochist then this game be for you my game rating 4 10,neg

2257,early access reviewi think this game be somewhat difficult to play even though i have be play adventurequestworld for over a year i would definitely recomend adventurequestworld to this one because not only do some of the control scheme not work but some thing get more difficult like pick up item in aqw the game would automatically collect item the enemy you kill yield but in this you have to manually pick up drop and add on with the bad camera control can make it infuriating to try to do i definitly think this game have potential if it be updatied to fix some of these issue as well as make it a little easy get a grip on if this be the first adventure quest game,neg

2269,the thing about this game be that it have so much potential the detail the fun and everything only 1 thing bring it all the way down it be that it will take age by age i mean age for you to actually unlock a new gun get xp to unlock a gun will take a long time you can reassemble and disassemble gun again and again but it will not give you that much of xp the only sustainable way of get xp be the daily reward which be flaw by itself everyday you get more and more xp 100 200 500 until 3000 think that it will help you out i think the same too but then after reach 3000 on day 7 the count restart to the measly 100 so much for come on everyday and this reward will increase so if you count the daily reward that you can get in a week that tally up to 6800 which at first seem like a lot but eventually you have to unlock gun that cost almost twice that amount so you just have two week of opening and close the game before you can get to any action when i play i always ask myself what be the point of have so many gun if you can not even use them the price to unlock all the gun be ridiculous too 50 dollar you may as well just add 10 buck to it and get battlefield 4 or something in conclusion this game could have work out brilliantly only a flawed daily reward system and the crazy amount of time need to progress bring it down all the way 3 10 star,neg

2289,surprisingly great game at least for an oldschool arpg lover like myself for me it outperform d3 main competitor on todays arpg market in every possible way needless to say i have already spend 100 hour in poe and it seem that this number will significantly increase over time pro dark atmosphere it be way dark than most game nowadays i dig it well balanced of course there be thing that be still arguable plenty of choise i mean plenty you can build really crazy character that still do not suck even on third difficulty real free to play no p2w at all completely even char slot count and stash size be quite fine by default game evolve over time new skill unique balance tweak every month act 4 in development all of this free of charge of course con desync on third difficulty with 10 exp death penalty it can be pretty annoying particularly for the melee char class i will not be explain this problem a lot here just google it there be plenty info out there,pos
2290,early access reviewid like to see the area scale better it feel like i be constantly under the level of the enemy in the area or that they be too bunch up and i can only fight one at a time or i will die iv try to overlook it but that s hard when the most basic and simple of quest require you to fight these enemy who be group together or way high level then you i do not know if i be the only one who feel this way but i feel like my character miss or his attack get dodge way too often it almost feel like a 50 50 split with my character miss almost every other attack i may very well be miss some key quest or something and i be just really under level and if that s so then ok but iv be pretty thurough in my look around zone so i would hope that s not the case i would like to see this game improve back it on kickstarter but where it be right now be just a little bit upsetting,pos
2291,an absolute shadow if its past gutte and butcher to shove in horrible microtransaction imbalanced match where you will fight bot 3 4x more powerful than your in every match the old elimination style mode throw out in favor of an auto regen deathmatch with infinite spawn it be an absolute shame such a fun and unique game turn in to such a piece of i really want to get back into this but it be just impossible especially when i go from own a ton of every end game piece and weapon and now i be leave with enough robit to buy half an epic weapon amazing,neg

2300,pro side scroller lot of combo various amount of class change various amount of class in general love the character personality pvp be actually fun con it be not grand chase,pos
2301,it be free amusing but it be arguably one of the bad game on steam boring as hell basically play itself the one song be terrible the art be really no well than free online gallery that have be out for decade dev need to step their game up take one look at the steam community will tell you all you need to know about this game probably give you a few good laugh,neg
2302,early access reviewalthough it have a rough start i have to say i be enjoy this game a lot more than the last few mmorpg that i play before it be still not perfect but for once i actually feel hopeful towards a dev team prop to neowiz for keep track of community feedback and actually do something about it rather quickly,pos
2303,ignore the 0 5 hour that s just the steam version i be in tier 5 america and have a positive kill death ratio in the p 51 mustang to anyone who have ever play this game long enough you will praise me as your new lord or repel me in the name of christ for anyone else let me tell you why this game have so much potential to be good but it squander it in the silly of way so let me just get this out of the way it be russian bias not even go to lie do not have to because i be in the safe steam forum where kgb i mean gaijin developer can not execute my post imagine this it be a terrible day to be a tanker the germans have a tiger and you have 1 t 34 in real life you win by number advantage in warthunder you win because the tiger decide to replace it be armor with paper and line it be hull with high explosive ammunition i can not believe how many time i have be ammo rack in a tiger you can be shoot in the track and your tank could randomly explode how do gaijin explain the game be still in developement that be why when tank first come out let just reduce the list capability of all german cannon by about 20 or if you wanna be technical model it at 15 degree before even regard what you be hit so technically you could hit something dead on and still be penalize 15 degree and just be glance off be this just one case example definietly not everytime they put new stuff in the game while completely ignore exist issue if it be russian they just say screw it raise all of its value from the previous plane time that by 2 and make it a ufo if it be anything else case example the twin mustang which be litterally a p51 time 2 be actually now 1 2 in value instead of make sure that the plane and tank in the game work well and historically they add in more plane and with the twin mustang be too lazy to even code the second engine wtf logic be that look i be not go to recommend this game this game feel like an abusive relationship in which many like me be give false feeling of love frankly the kick that i can get out of this game be win in a tiger or p 51 because the odd be stack so poorly in your favor that its the feeling of satisfaction that i like if you play for that i applaud you but for everyone else fly ufo plane and ww2 t 90 you be so blind to how bad this game really be btw i can agree with many of the other negative review but the positive review seem like they be from easily impressed people the funny one be from people who recognize the blatant issue but still think this game be worth it i do not as a ww2 history enthisiast i have be push to world of tank that be how bad this game have become at least war gaming have a method to their madness here make sure you pray to rngesus,neg
2304,i differ from most reviewer that i have read my gripe be not against the cynical pay2win design or anything like that i utterly loathe the art and the game mechanic people say this game look pretty i i be truly flabbergast by that as i think it be the ugliest most generic look piece of garbage and the game mechanic be superficial and in no way interesting i would stay away from this game a long long way away,neg
2305,early access reviewshould you get this game ansew be yes and let me tell you why it all start a long time time ago rughly about 16 hour play on ring of elysium and boi oh boi be i sceptical people be say its a well pubg but i know as pubg have laggy server and i think to my self bright if you get this game you will be dissapote nope i be wrong good battle royal game i have play so far it also have bot and custom match come to it d how exciting,pos
2306,i be not sure i would bother it be an okay game if you just have it run in the background while you be do something else but later on in the game the table just turn to the absurd i have fail like 7 8 rush in a row when they have a 30 or low failure rate this happen because radroaches spawn inside and start siphon off all my energy and mole rat for some reason at high level siphon energy extremely fast also everything siphon energy when you get above 60 people in your vault the game just spike in difficulty when you get to 40 and to 60 people so i think the smart way to play the game would be to just sit on your hand and try and pump up all your character below 39 people and then play the game afterwards even so the mechanic be stupid if someone break into your vault and nobody be in a room which happen it seem 90 of the time they go for an empty room you have to send people from another area then they inevitably get there too late and the invader burrow to another room so eventually all your people be run everywhere and you can not keep track of which character have a good gun to actually fight off this invasion all the while everyone take radiation damage and physical damage and they be siphon off your energy which in turn shut down the majority of your vault building its great so then you have to temporarily pull people off of every other duty they be do when your vault be hum like a swiss watch and put them onto energy production then you have to manage to remember to put everyone back where they be before hand a near impossible task its just an annoyance a huge annoyance then if you be lucky you spend the rest of the time just click on status update like gather energy or gather food or the rare opportunity that you be able to to level someones stat up i think this game would be a lot well if the endurance stat do not exist apparently the only way to really level up your hero health a lot be to pump up their endurance so you have to put all your low level on endurance training for like 4 real time day to pump up their endurance only then can you really make use of them in other capacity if you really want to maximize their experience it be pretty dumb the whole game feel like a waste of time sadly i just do not have much else to play so i be do it i swear though the first time someone come in and wipe my vault i be do with this game forever its really a micro transaction game about gamble with the lunchboxe they give you early on because lunchboxe that you have to buy with real money to get in any regularity contain card which can help you when you be struggle but they can also just give you useless legendary material that 99 of people will never be able to use because they will quit the game before they can make the stuff its stupid even then manufacture a rare weapon take 16 real hour i can only imagine a legendary one would take 5 day or something so in short stay away it just be not fun enough over the long term the only real fun i have be go out on quest and even those require you to wait hour and hour unless you buy some nuka cola yes real money again to speed thing up it be just a way to siphon money and its too nakedly obvious to want to even do it generally game like this have you provide you with a fun experience along the way but this one just feel 100 design to siphon money,neg
2307,early access reviewthe game be not bad at the start it be really nice get use to the switch combo be the hard part of the game then i get ban because i be use a outside program i have no out side program so i get ban for no reason on that one waste 77 hour on this game to get wrongfully ban contact customer support and that so far have not be worth it can not even get a response,neg

2313,i want to like this game but its feed a gambling addition that in mind i be watch the odd and like all game that feature card or random odd i be count i be give it a thumb up for now i have suspicion that they scale difficulty in the event like the draft and event understandably you have a level as well if there be scale odd associate with these feature it should be disclose in black and white feature odd against the scaling and or disclose the player pool you be against at each level or do not modify the odd beyond pure random,neg

2362,i have to compare it with hearthstone because it be very similar and we all know that hearthstone be at the top right now i will break into part while review pay to win vs not so pay to winish as far as i play we be all aware that hearthstone be p2w because without pack you can not have card without card you can not make a decent deck without a deck you be enforce to lose earning pack be not that easy or fun and when those hard earn pack give you only 1 rare card it get really annoying let not forget that they bring a new expansion each 3 4 month or so you have limit time to get the card you want you can always pay though in this game as far as i have see it be easy to earn and drop legendary and epic card i get like 5 legendarie in my 5 hour playtime each pack give you 12 card you have more chance and you get what you deserve p s hearthstone pack rate make me a fckn psycho 1 legendary in 30 pack gameplay1 this game have so many card type that i can not even remember while play i think a majority them make no sense charge poison stun spell i can understand every card game have them but there be many other that i can not even remember their name hearthstone be easy to understand for these aspect idk in what condition it be right now 2 so you can not attack minion in this game directly with other minion you select your minion to attack if the other player choose to block with one of his minion you attack the minion instead of the hero it be a little different and i do not like it it get so confusing with other aspect of the card while play i be like how the f do he attack me and i could not or i just block you how can you attack my hero i simply do not like it 3 your mana do not increase on its own you deck consist of 75 card 30 of them be by default mana card that when use you gain 1 mana and can be use 1 each round this make the deck creation process more hardcore you can decide on this yourself but sometimes i be draw like no mana card and stick at 4 mana while my oponent be at 11 manas events singleplayer etci only play the tutorial singleplayer mode and it feel normal like hearthstone would have also the same mode do exist like create a deck and play with other player until you loose a certain time for a prize i think that be all i be really hope to like it but i do not maybe i still have a love for hearthstone deep in i do not play anymore or maybe it be just bad and confusing like i say,neg

2377,indeed even though i have get almost a 1000 hour log not even include the many hour play this outside steam before it officially launch i can not recommend war thunder reason the grind it be horrible it take hundred of hour to unlock high tier tank and plane force you to grind or pull your wallet the graphic be great the gameplay be great except for terrible balance issue and it will hook you but it would be well to avoid be hook a terrible waste of time if the grind in the high tier be comparable to tier 1 2 it would be a great game but of course that would mean many player will reach endgame unlock everything there be to unlock and potentially lose interest great for player bad for gaijin as every customer be a potential virtual opium addict milkable of cash it take 1000s of dollar to unlock everything a premium account only help on low tier you still have to grind xx xxx hour on the high tier and that be the problem freemium be not free i be all for force free to play user to grind but those that spend money on a premium account should notice a huge difference and that be clearly not the case spend 60 usd on a premium account 1 vehicle unclock be but the tip of the tip of the iceberg so even if you pay it will not make a difference on high tier the reaility be that it take month or week at 40 hour a week use a premium account that be just ridicilous get million of convertable xp use it to progress faster but pay 50 usd on top of that to be allow to actually use it there simply should not be such a grind for pay user spend around 60 usd should give you a lot more bang for buck pay 100 usd for a tank take the fun away gaijin can do whatever they want it be free but the implementation be offensive to loyal pay user i would happily spend my money on premium but the difference be so small that i do not do so anymore every game even those that hold a pricetag should have a certain amount of grind the difference between free and premium progression be just too small to justify the price it take to progress,neg

2382,early access reviewtl dr it be a great game already if you like the kind of combat you find in smash if you like shiny rank and if you like nice streamer then this be for you pro it be not a traditional combo base fighter anyone familiar with smash bros will feel right at home the attack feel very satisfy the control be super smooth too dare i say it yeah i do item feel very balanced in this game none of this fox only no item final destination stuff you pick up one of two character specific weapon that alter your moveset you drop em if you get wreck the weapon spawn randomly on the battlefield open up for quake like weapon denying which be pretty fun both as the guy try to outmaneuver the guy with the pointy rocket stick and say rocket stick guy who be get a scrub to turn into a pincushion they spawn rather regularly so die once will not end the game for you you can throw your weapon and it feel so satisfy to toss a spear in someones face and then grab it into a combo i will actually put in another pro just for throwing do i mention it feel satisfy it have a training mode that display hitboxe and hurtboxes clear as day it make practice easy there be a cash shop but it contain cosmetic only extremely polished for an early access title this be what early access should be like con only one server and its in the us play fighting game online with 150 ms be not particularly entertaining hopefully us europoor will get our grubby mitt on one of our own soon enough now be the time eurobros the health circle at the top right be a bit far off one glance up there to gauge everyone health could be your unfortunate end if you put it at the bottom of the screen like smash do that would be swell i will not tell nintendo the hard cpu set in training be nowhere near a player in term of difficulty the announcer pronounce badvars name as bodvar now keep in mind folk this game be compare a lot to smash but it be its own game its probably not go to be completely similar to smash bros but that do not stop it from be a fantastic game now if the developer of this game happen to be read this thank you for be the first to make a game like this for pc i buy the collector pack and i will try my good to prove to you that there be a market for this kind of game by force friend to do the same at gunpoint i hope you will continue work hard on this great game i would give this game an 8 10 and its probably go to be my 9 or even 10 after it go out of beta,pos

2385,first ever review that i write on steam i be so dissapointed i grow up play dota and so many memory tie to it but i believe it be time for me to delete it forever the last update be just a joke to all the good time and people i meet i really wonder what be go through those guy mind when they decide this be a step forward,neg
2386,first off why do steam allow a mobile game onto their store just because it be popular you have no reason to get this port just get it for your phone if only it be a good game this game only gimmick be that it be the original format no synchro no xyzs no pendulum just the og card except the fact that konami have to put in new card into the game in order to boost consistency and support also you only have 3 monster card zone and 3 spell trap card zone which make some card and archtype like dark scorpion unplayable speaking of card where be the good card 80 of the card be pack filler garbage 15 be decent 4 9 be good and 01 be great also some card from the og format be go for some reason most of the element hero fusion be not there some gladiator beast be miss and there be only two monarch and the reason for why the monarch be go be the main reason of why this game suck the og format suck almost all of the card suck and the concept of archtype be still be figure out so consistency and support be nonexistent synchro xyzs pendulum and even link summoning be far well than the og format each one help evolve yu gi oh into a well game except maybe link summon sychros make the extra deck actually worth have xyzs speed the game up and allow easy access to the extra deck pendulum allow well swarm and link summoning help counter op extra deck spammer what do the og have a lot of crappy fusion that be not worth run and ritual monster that only where relevant due to two ritual archtype that come out after the og format literally the only reason that you would play this game be for nostalgia and nostalgia be the only thing that will carry you through this game if you understand this game even a little you will become to op for npc in no time you will mow through them so efficiently that not auto dueling will become torture really fast in 24 hour i be almost able to collect all the card available for one box set of card that have 600 total card in it with the amount of card you get with each pack be only three measly card it only take me around 30 pack to make a deck that be so good that i have to brick in order for my opponent to have a chance to beat me as for keep you come back to the game the game offer pathetic event and the fact that every energy bar that be the staple for long mobile game like this fill up really quickly that you have no choice but to keep playing which be bad for game like this the reason the energy bar exist be to keep gameplay in quick short burst and prevent burn out if a mobile game force you to sit down and empty your battery it go against the entire point of a mobile game finally another big problem with this game be the skill to keep thing simple the skill allow you to cheat and make the game even easy skill have appeal because it make you feel like your playing like they do in the anime but let it sink in that everyone in the original season cheat and the anime have to make up card and edit exist card in order to allow the heore win with their terrible deck grant you do not have to use skill unless you want to play against other player speak of which how be play against other player not that good the more you face off against high level player the more you start see the same card over and over again be this game good no be this game at least playable yes but not for long there be far well yu gi oh game that you could be play instead that play this be down right stupid just play one of the console handheld the actual card game or buy and play yu gi oh legacy of the duelist on steam 3 10 would never want to play this game ever again,neg

2388,  before read keep in mind i have close to 30 ish hour but my bethesda launcher break so i re download it on steam this game be great especially if you be a lore guy the card artwork be not sloppy and the game itself be quite interesting if you like elder scroll but may not be into card game i would give it a try anyway the story be not very good but it be more about gameplay every race play differently for example imperial spawn large number then buff them up it bring you in slowly but if you jump straight into multiplayer it can be a bit overwhelming all in all for the price of 0 i would say its fantastic,pos

2404,early access review it be in fact the recent slew of negative review that first bring this product to my attention while explore my que and get me curious as to what the hubbub be all about then later on that same day a twitch youtube streamer that i frequent start stream the game and get me really curious once i actually see the gameplay i think this game be a blasty blast it bring thoughtfully strategic and tactical gameplay in a 3 dimensional environment to a broad genre of game that be very similar to each other longtime rts moba and shooter fan alike could all find different reason to like this game the ship be gorgeous and remind me of cover art for sci fi novel out of the 80 and 90 i e larry niven steve webber isaac asimov and the like if you be ever that guy that like the idea of moba arena style gameplay like lol dota 2 hero of the storm paragon smite etc etc but be look for something that slow thing down a little bit not the length of match but the pace of gameplay then this could be the game for you add in the fact that you be pilot massive warship with kilometer long engagement range instead of a wee widdle hero champion trudge down the same dirt path and it get even well fan of game like x2 x3 x4 that think the world be a little lonely without other people or the strategy gem sin of a solar empire that want some more fast paced and short game time match but still want to get their blowy up the space ship on should give this a try people who like the concept of eve online and enjoy the basic pvp gameplay but get turn off by the way super hardcore community world etc may also want to try this out hell even starcraft fan may find something to like in this game the community be dangerously small i hope this game make it to full release and the overall level of content have a long way to go before this game be ready for the masse but it have that magic spark that could could develop into something awesome if you want more on the negative aspect of the game go find another review if you want to figure out what make this game awesome just install it and give it a try and be patient this be not call of duty in space,pos

2415,early access reviewafter read some of the negative comment i must say it be not as bad as they paint it the game about building vehicle like they be lego and put gun on them and pin your creation against other people creation it be fun satisfaction come from see your creation bust up the creation of other people as you shoot them at the end of the match you return to your mothership to make repair and or change to your ship before the next match repair cost increase the high level you be but you usually earn more than what you loose in repair at high tier it do start dig into your pocket but it create an environment where careful strategy against the enemy become the main focus and not some rambo crazy kamikaze attack because you will literally end up pay for mistake with credit you can use to otherwise upgrade your ship sure there be premium user but that be not a huge deal all they get be block that you can also get with some game time they still have to level up to use enough of them because of the cpu point system so it be not exactly pay2win because i must emphasize that you can get what they can the more you play my favorite part about this game be the physics engine you can not just make any vehicle work out so it be funny see people at spawn flip over onto their back or fly ship go haywire because they can not get good weight distribution overall it be a great game to pick up play for a bit and then do something else you will not regret it oh do i mention it be a free download yeah review update 12 10 2015the game just keep get well and betterrepair cost be go and new part just keep flow in optimization be fantastic and with each update come a fresh breath of air that spice thing up,pos

2455,tldr up front have its pro and con as a game but if you be not a loaded and b a super hardcore combat flight simmer for the con it have this game seriously be not worth your money and oh boy you be go to have to fork it up to buy in if you want to know why i think that read on so i have a few hour in the steam version and many many more in standalone i have a handful of module why be i come to steam to make this review despite be a standalone player because see this in steam be what get me to check it out in the first place and i be lucky i get my nose in the community enough to get warn away from the steam version as for the pro of this game there be more than enough glow review of this game to tell you the pro so i be go to focus on why i be not recommend this i will save the problem with the steam version for other negative reviewer in here as they have more skin in the game than me so here go my first gripe with this game be that the actual gaming content just be not there there be no dynamic campaign to speak of what be this 1995 despite dynamic campaign otherwise be the industry standard the mission editor be weak and do not have a big community like armas hammer out content there be almost no professionally develop co op content to speak of multiplayer be lack with the exception of a couple community dynamic campaign and the on rail singleplayer campaign be meh at best yeah flying be fun but if i be look to have fun just fly i would look at a different game i be here to fly high performance aircraft and blow stuff up eagle dynamic ed need to step their game up literally this game deserve much much well content which lead in to my next point that point be that the dlc module aka the plane you buy be obscenely expensive this be a true example of the gillette razor business model they give you the razor for free and they charge your pant off for the blade most of the plane in this game be sweet they be thorough they be model to a great level than pretty much every other civilian simulation out there but when you do not have the content in which to really have fun with these module their intrinsic value drop like a rock you can not convince me to drop 80 buck on an early access f a 18 when aaa title that have solid gameplay from start to finish to post completion be consistently 60 i have bill to pay ed and not everyone that play your game be some kind of filthy rich flight sim snob that have hundred and hundred of dollar to blow on dlc the absurd cost of these dlc module seriously make me think you guy believe that i get that development be expensive but you have to price this stuff at a level that make sense for the consumer and with the state of the gameplay itself it really do not help justify the high cost of these module i be a pretty serious flight simmer i have be at it since i be a little kid and the cost still just do not add up 80 for a plane that i can jack around with in instant action play a campaign that will be fun once and only once hope there be some community develop co op for if i be actually able to get my friend into this game or play multiplayer with a bunch of people i do not know or i can pay 60 for a full feature aaa title that i know be go to be a great time heck i would probably rather just buy a 30 indie title that i know i will lose hundred and hundred of hour in they charge you for the map besides georgia they charge you for wwii asset they charge the crap out of you for the buggy land warfare module they charge you 60 70 for the other top of the line module they charge you for additional campaign assume you already have a great rig to play this on get a hotas and headtracker the minimum require peripheral imo and the price it cost to get the full fidelity plane you want the buy in cost for this game be ridiculous that be not count the cost of plane down the line if you want to get into vr or whatever other side asset like map or vehicle they be go to charge you for that be why i seriously do not recommend this game the cost to fun ratio be seriously not there that be come from a sim aviation enthusiast and a general gaming enthusiast unless you see yourself build an all out sim pit in the future just about any other low fidelity combat flight simulator out there will give you a well time and you actually have a chance to get some of your friend to buy in and play it with you,neg

2488,to be fair you can get through the vast majority of the game upto levl 60 without spend a penny in real money i only start think i may need to buy item at a much later stage in the game as pvp at level 60 be pretty hard and its cleara lot of the guy have pay stuff which give them a massive advantage however i pvpd right upto to 60 on a competitive level with armour and weapon gain freely neverwinter be a enjoyable game if you be willing to put the time into it its not one of them game you can dip into for 1 hour and expect to be draw in craft your characer will take considerable time and effort and in some case do tedious quest over and over its a very in depth game with lot of angle too many infact but in a way that give the game a long life span as there be always something new to do graphically the game be quite nice but can get laggy on even the good of pc most likely due to server congestion overall i would recommend people try this game but be prepared to put more than a few hour into it to see its ful potential,pos

2501,first thing first the game be controversial do not get fool by my playtime combine with my time use the soe launcher my gametime go into multiple thousand of hour so here my advise if u wanna go alone and just grind gun stay away from it you will find the grind tedious you will be outgunne by people who be bad than you but win because they gang up on you i be not say u can not have fun in the game go solo from time to time i do so myself the actual joy come in when you become part of a team do not matter if you be an elitist in your small squad of energdrinking doritoeating memelord or you be be a small part of a way big machine play continent wide king of the hill while do so the cert u need for all of your upgrade will come along the way actual review overview we have here an mmofps in which u can play one of three faction or all of them that emphasive the management of population and the right form of deployment in a nutshell when u be bring 12 guy deploy as light infantry and you be go against 48 player go at you combine arm style you be in for a rough ride and should question the sanity of your squadlead when two army be manage properly and be go at each other then you be in for an experience that be unrivaled across all game i be aware of the faction you can play be suppose to be asymetricly balanace but in reality the only realy difference be the gunsound with a different gimmick here and there to make a perfectly inaccurate statement nc hit hard fire slow tr have big magazine vs have fast reload speed and no bullet drop the bullet drop be not so handy though graphic and optimization the graphic age well the game be from 2012 and on ultrasetting u will get some cool visual however the optimization be far from perfect so u need a decent rig to able to play the game on low setting its recommend for all lowend rig to completely turn of shadow and light effect gunplay this game use clientside if you do not know what that mean pls use google before you read on the ttk when play infantry vs infantry be pretty high 6 8 hit there be a lot of shiny thing u can use use to upgrade you class but they be not of any use if u do not understand clientside people camp in corner will be in a disadvantage in this game also because of the high ttk infantry combat be relatively close quarterish compare with other game vehiclegameplay i will not go into ground vehicle here since well everyone know what they can expect from them there be tank armour trooptransport and what have ya not that different from what already exist irl however the airgame be different from u may have experience in other game the fly vehicle in the game all kind of act like attack helicopter this be due to the ability to hover that all airvehicle have this turn dogfight into helicopter battle where the combatant usually face each other instead of get on the six of one another if u wanna be more than cannonfodder in the air you also need lot of practice since the more advanced manouver be not really intuitive and need practice there be some good vid on youtube for that psw there be nothing currently avaiable in the game that can not be earn through just play the game however camos and other cosmetic be only drop when u win an alert and its a random drop so if u really wanna have a certain shiny thing on your armor u may help out your grandpa in the garden and invest the money u get there in shinys all other thing can be aquire by certification point that u get every 250 xp point or so as state above if you be just play this game for the grind while also go solo u will have a hard time to aquire the cert u want to unlock the much need upgrade on you utility slot general advise the basic gun u get to start with be the most versatile invest your first cert in the actual class abilite and slot will upgrade your char more than a 1k cert gun that u just buy because some good player use it there be implant in the game that can be buy in lootboxes with cert or with real cash i think the mechanic be problematic but the implant be not these implant give you tiny or nice to have gimmic that improve the qulity of life but do not make you inherently strong you can have the good implant in the game when you do not know how to clientside u still get rekt it be worth note here that if the main continent the one with most population often have a queue to get into if u play the faction with most population if u aquire membership also give a bit more xp u will be treat with priority i can not give definitive answer here since i guess that the whole psw need more definition i can tolerate it,pos

2519,brawhalla be a very unique and challenging game which have many different game mode and be certainly worth it as it be free do not need an amazing pc to play and you can play with your friend and immerse yourself in many hour of gameplay that never get bore there be nothing i dislike about this game,pos
2520,when i start this game i do not know what to expect i start run into the grassy field in front of me and find nothing even after 20 minute i question this walk simulator however crouch down and start walk much slow a few minute later i hear a deer call and be a novice simply walk toward it i do not know yet that you be equip with a tracker that locate where the deer be i pull out my rifle and scope in to the general vicinity that i believe the deer to be shortly i see it in my sight i take careful aim fired and completely miss the deer run away and i do not get a kill that hunt all in all i absolutely adore this game the gorgeous wild beauty mix with the enjoyable tracking and hunting of your animal make this game incredibly fun for me at least see this game be not a game where you get kill every other minute this be a game in which up to hour of time climaxes in one moment where you have your animal in your sight if you blow the shot you can expect a minimum of 20 30 minute either track the same animal down or look for a different beast all together another thing about this game that put people off be the price tag although the game itself be f2p you have to buy hunting license for all animal expect the whitetail deer furthermore the only viable way to get equipment such as deer odor to conceal your scent from the deer or a tent to start your hunt at a place which you place your tent in previous hunt alongside rifle shotgun and handgun be to pay occasionally large sum of real money for some this be the ultimate turn off i believe it to be irritating that you have to pay for this content however i be still content with the game itself see what i do there 9 10 for a solid realistic and accurate hunting game with a few flaw,pos
2521,early access reviewwell supposedly i have play this for 557 hrs all i do be leave my laptop run for day on end i forget about it anyways the game be fun because you get to build a robot and shoot other robot from what i gather from other review it have a pay to play feature which i highly dislike it take a ton of time to get anywhere and you be pair with random people not at all in your skillset compare to what you have build unlocked so it could be a fun game but really it be just frustrating,neg

2523,my favorite hunting simulation its not cheap and its not free to play you can however play it like a demo you get one weapon and 2 3 animal to hunt but to really enjoy then game you have to buy a time membership and alot of stuff from the ingame shop which be quite expensive but for that you get the good hunting sim out there they constantly add new map reserve animal and gun so if you willing to pay for it you get a lot of fun at least if you be a patient gamer hunting be a lot of wait if you really want to invest money in it i hardly suggest buy one of the shotgun first with nearly all of them you have a weapon which be allow to hunt every animal in the game watch some let play and read some forum post for more information so i really enjoy this game and can suggest it to any gamer interested in a hunting game have fun,pos

2542,early access reviewi m not familiar with this third person strategy genre but i can tell you this be a good title the space ship model look amazing due to the unreal engine 4 the big ship feel heavy as they should in real life you need some practice with this game but the menu control be pretty good you get familiarize with the key pretty soon and start to enjoy the last part of the tutorial advanced battle even more i haven t check the game online cause i need friend who own this title to play 5 vs 5 and this be where the game must really shines unfortunately my pc spec be in the low section and i m quite sure you need a good system for that kind of multiplayer the lack of single player mission be the downside here i bet they can add randomly generate mission arcade style and campaign mode soon remember that the game be at early access so they re probably consider those option i enjoy the in game tutorial a lot i be glad i download the game for free just hope this game will not turn into a money machine 9 10,pos

2545,i have never really write a review for any game on steam but this game break that mold in fact it break lot of mold in the moba genre in all its a moba game that use a third person camera at all time while this may seem like a quirky gimmic that make the game uninteresting in a few moment of gameplay it do not it always keep my attention and i waste hour play this game without even realise it and that s the thing whenever i try to play any other moba game dota 2 league of legend i get bore quickly because i feel like the action just be not there this game on the contrary be always fill with excitment and i be always on my toe when i play this game all of the basic attack be what s call skill shot mean you have to aim in order to kill anyone in this game unlike other moba game you do not click on the ground to move instead you move with the wasd key and you have to option to re bind them to something else currently the game have about 69 god to play as from different pantheon god be essentially your character that you can choose to play as or a champion if you will and they all look and sound great hell the entire game look amazing even when everything be turn down on low the game mode vary from conquest 5v5 to joust 3v3 and if that be not enough you have a motd or a mode of the day which should add a little something to your life if you ever get bored of classic 5v5 a motd be a random mode with the rule change whether it be extra money or all one character or a mode where everyone be already to the max level in the end i could keep go about how amazing this game be i have play this for like a gazillion hour before it even come to steam or i could just end on say if you want to try a moba game that s a little diffrent but still fun smite be your game,pos
2546,look for that good old neverwinter night feel but in an mmo format then you will be sorely disappoint i conclude very quickly that this title be neverwinter in name alone where the long since establish d d rule system and mechanic be no where in sight hence i do not play for very long out of blind disappointment instead of the second come we get this weird mix of modern action orientate combat apparently borrow mechanic and idea from a wide range of similar game and throw them haphazardly into a boil pot of lore loosely base on the beloved neverwinter night game and d d universe where this game have a chance to shine though be through it be surprisingly complex and complete quest creation system there be a metric tonne of player create quest here for well or bad some be really well write and think out while other be painfully incomplete and outright boring would i recommend it if you be familiar with the role of be a gamemaster or just love to create story this may just be the game for you if you be look for yet another f2p mmo in which to kill thing this may be the game for you if you be look for a solid neverwinter night d d experience keep look tl dr leave your love and expectation of d d at the door and you should be fine,pos

2556,ok so i download this game despite the 3 000 and some odd number of negative review and to my surprise there it be not a free to play not a free to play with slight premium buy but a pay to win then after 3 or so month pay to win again as soon as i load the game up the first screen that pop up be the purchase screen so this tell me that this be nothing but a milk machine for the skeezy developer that make this and once i get past that i actually get into the game and what do you know i start with nothing but my hand and a camera so upon further investigation of the get a gun situation i find that i have to exit the game entirely and go to the launcher to get equip with something so i know that be a free to player i would not get the good but i get the absolute bad i get some crappy gun that look like it be texture in ps2 era and i still have to buy ammo which cost in game currency so i go to buy some and nope i get no start cash so basically it be try to force me to pay up to get some in game currency so i could purchase ammo for a free gun i feel like this should be label as a bad game and take off steam due to the 3 000 some odd number negative review say it be a horrible game and nothing but a scheme to rob people i be go to try and contact the developer to see if i do something wrong and how i can fix it and i may change my review,neg

2562,i love this game but the deck be stack against you excuse the pun the fact that they make you pay for the new set be crazy the game be already good and now they be add a pay to win gimmick it be too bad the game be already really good i bet lot of people be buy booster pack what can you do some company just want to see the world burn,pos
2563,this game would be absolutely awesome if it be not free i mean pay to win then they would not attempt to make it totally impossible to play without buy thing in game continually while i never give them a penny unless you have utterly stellar willpower i would recommend just skip this game too bad because i would have happily buy this game have it be an actual game instead of a lame attempt to buy disposable thing the way pay to win game such as this be design now i be off to uninstall it sadly,neg
2564,just amazing need more tank like the actual one that s why i always wait for more update hopefully it be still diffrent from the console version big versionsperfect for small run laptop or perfect for handheld devise i have it on my tablet with same account and tank so it nice that it can be transfure from multiple device,pos
2565,frankly you would have to be in a coma to not want to try the game see as it be totally free of charge regardless of your first impression from review give it a whirl as you probably already know planetside 2 be all about fighting in huge battle with dozen or hundred of player simultaneously in a persistent world compose of three four continent which be roughly 8 x 8 km large indar semiarid desert esamir freeze tundra amerish lush mountain range and in the come summer hossin overgrown swamp you can take control of a soldier from the totalitarian terran republic tr who rely heavily on conventional weapon with high rate of fire and quick vehicle cover with a red black color scheme in addition there be the new conglomerate nc freedom fighter who rely on high recoil gauss weapon and slow move gameplay all saturate with blue gold paint then there be the vanu sovereignty vs who have purple and teal alien energy weapon and a variety of special trait over the other two the battle the three faction fight across the continent be a ton of fun with the large battle claim the life of dozen of player in a few second with the battle themselves last hour or rarely day the game lighting which be unbelievably good take a look at the night sky when player be shoot flak at aircraft make the fight visually spectactular with huge explosion and tracer round make even small fight hard to miss the sound be also extremely good with the thundering of war and explosion with the whirr of bullet fly past your head provide unmatched immersion in an fps the game have five basic infantry class the combat medic who do what you think he do the engineer who set up turret supply ammo and repair thing infiltrator who can hack enemy terminal and equipment lay mine and cloak heavy assault who blow up fortification and vehicle with hmgs and rocket launcher and have resist shield finally there be the light assault who have a jetpack and annoy people in addition to the above there be also a set of powered battle armour call the max suit that player can equip that enable them to trash enemy of all kind for a price those infantry can use a large selection of cross faction and faction specific vehicle like the air superiority fighter main battle tank and ifv which keep the battle mobile and dangerous they be also a lot of fun to use for obvious reason ever run over a 20 strong platoon of soldier in a tank i have not everything be peachy however though nothing be bad the size of the game and other technical hurdle leave it unable to support high quality texture on par with todays gold standard with its graphic be roughly equivalent to 2011s good although the art style offset this somewhat the game historically poor performance and optimization have be more or less fixed but the game be still somewhat taxing on old computer if your rig be old than say three year you will have to fiddle with some setting there be some balance issue with faction specific vehicle and weapon but most be relatively minor and the few that be not be not have be patch the current metagame i e a sense of accomplishment and permanence to your action be rather lack at the moment with the continent swinge wildly from 90 vs control to 80 nc to 70 tr very little territory in the game stay with your faction for more than a few day this should be fix when hossin be release when they will release continent lattice which will enable team to totally conquer the game world certification the in game currency you earn by get experience point be somewhat slow to accumulate so if you be plan on get good gear several hour of gameplay be the minimum requirement you also can not purchase in game cosmetic item with cert you must buy them with real money other even more minor thing be present but none not even the one i describe be really a hinderance by any stretch the game be an absolute joy to play even if you do not put any money into it and it offer an expeience you can not get anywhere else i award this game a great 8 10 a definite download for fan of the fps genre d,pos
2566,impressive demo but i hate the iap free limited play model graphic sound be superb the interface be terrible and a little confusing so far can not see picture of car available for selection before a race and the load time terrible and i be run this use a 16 gb nvidia gtx ssd drive with 32 gb ram i guess my 3500 laptop be not fast enough for this game it run smooth but load time be unacceptable,pos
2567,i have many more hour on this game on other platform but this will be a review of the pc version of this game summary this game be fun but be so terribly un optomize un balanced and just a flat out break i would not recommend get into it go play lol or just any other moba truth be tell this game be very fun and action pack unlike lol where it just feel like 90 of the game be grind to fight smite action be contiunus and even if you be 30 kill down you can still come back and win the game there be so many great thing about this game but the company ruin it they do not listen to their commuinity they do not fix any bug they do not balance character but hey once every 5 month they will push out a new un orginal god also if you like waste money on cosmetic this be a good game they constantly push out skin instead of fix their uncountable bug another thing they have be do be relase reallybounus game inside of smite that be honestly pretty trash for the most part and unlessz you have a season pass its impossible to progress in they honestly remind me of a small child with add try to make a project but anyway i be go to still play it so,neg
2568,original review for a 1 0 release it be as buggy as hell beta be more stable will recommend once it be actually work right could not recommend at the time positive edit they update quickly to resolve most quality of life issue overall the experience be improve already but would have hope the ui bug would be catch pre 1 0i be not a fan of cross class unlock i e you have to unlock and level up a corvette to unlock some strat cruiser i know what gameplay i like and do not want to be force to grind a class i have no interest in i know it be there as an incentive to buy past the requirement and the free to play be pretty fair so i suppose some grind be require overall in a sentence it be similar but not the same as fractured space i find this slightly less tactical but more bombastic so still enjoyable regardless satisfy graphic and sound design with a reasonably fun gameplay loop ctf need work it be free to play capital ship battle 8 10 i also play closed and open alpha and gameplay be pretty much the same in general,pos
2569,if you like furrie anime 13 year old girl people be cover in mud losy fit skirt and top stay up until 3 a.m. play game with the door shut look at people in a lot of costumesthen this be the game for you and the whole family maybe not the whole family but you catch my drift play on a tablet to get the good weeaboo experience imaginable buy all the dlc that come out almost everyday for only 99 cent wow now will you excuse me i need to restock my tissue supply have a good day play this really weird game,pos

2571,10 10 game the way the game draw itself out to be an easy game with specimen 1 cardboard cutout be something i personally appreciate i personally be not a very brave person and be scared by everything and be even scare by specimen 1 since i be expect something to attack me the game use atmosphere to its advantage in an excellent way and after play the game alone i have see stuff move such as my own shadow and flinch true story spookys jump scare mansion be a great game to play with friend too as my friend would freak out when something happen on the laggy screen i cast onto which would make me smile as i be already in the next room the only issue i have with the game be the screen move downwards and to the left occasionally but it be easy to get past i wish i could take screenshot to share with friend but print screen work just as well as a substitute definitely give the game a chance if you have the time since it be free i really hope to get one of my friend to play the hd remake in vr someday cause i be not go to do it,pos
2572,for the first 4 attempt at play this 1st the screen go black just at the part you never want it to full of loot night come in and out in the open you would be forgive for think this be a plot or i just get hack and when i do get back into the server yea i be dead but spawn 100 yard from my loot 2nd graphic glitch then total crash of my machine not frikin happy with that at all oh and before you get into spout update your system and driver well they be just update the day before try this and i have be ok for the last 6 machine i have build 3rd another black screen from nowhere but the play go on as i could hear the grunt sponge head close to me however i do recover the screen do not ask i hit multiple key to get it back somehow 4th another lockup black screen again and finally i get the screen back only to find i have be kick for not play lol what a load of but then the 5th time i get to play for a further 4 hour without a glitch hack lockup kick or any problem at all ithink the 10 yr old hacker have to go to bed for school the next day only kiddin there guy but when i do get a good run at it i get the feeling it be an aftermath clone with some good improvement like the shop and the bar and such 7 10 i give it 7 out of 10 mostly because its free to d load and play with a little more attention to remove the graphic freeze the author could ask a fair price for the game its worth a go if you can get a few hour play without any problem oh btw i do not change the server or the country eu in all the game play,pos
2573,not only at how many hour i have now but base on how many i have play even before steam release i think i can write a honest review first of all this be a great game with lot of potential that be why i have be play it for quite a time but the developer on this game decide to make it even more painfull for new or begin player to enjoy the game as you know in this game you can buy item with game dollar gc and bandage dx in the late patch of januari they decide to remove the dx as a currency and all dx above 10000 be exchange for game dollar which make it almost impossible to buy sniper or gear from the store because of the ridiculous high price second of all they reduce drop from super zombie and from loot crate etc it be hard to get loot not only because the pve server be always full and rent a private server have be disable for over 3 4 month but because once you spawn in all the people be full gear clan from 3 to 11 people have train skilltree so they have a small advantage have well weapon or attachment to kill you easily with that be say about adventage the big adventage be that it be pay to win you can buy credit with real money exchange it for skin or skinboxes or dx trade it for all kind of gear and tadaaa you now have a full global inventory and you never need to worry about lose item that be not the game it use to be and it be really sad to see it have come to this i hope i make clear why you should not invest time or money in this game as it only reward you with an empty global inventory or an empty wallet small summary of pro and con pro cool and unique pvp clan system be unique killstreak be be reward with more cash reputation system reward you for kill bandit or rep or give you negative rep if you kill civilian or rep you can find all sort of item across map con really low and small loot for a server like this no sniper and almost no crate too many clan or friend team up every server there be different pvp city spawn in an other map teleport your character to a new random location you can never use 1 character on multiple map without spawn at a random locatian everytime you spawn pay to win all advantage you get for be premium be just too many skill cap be too high you have beginner server but only someone with 0 kill and below 72 hour can play on it premium server pvp with car yes i know it be e but the hitbox be just so big hacker and lagger all over the place have not i say enough to convice you not to play this game anyway i hope this review help you consider to play this game yes or no thank for read,neg
2574,this game make me so frustrated it have pro and con and if tend to could be so much well for player and producer after play various character reach endgame this be my conclusion pve amazing tho a bit linear still have good story and quest compare to allot of other grind out there i enjoy many of the zone and contrary to many critic on vioce acting i do not find it too bad which be hardwork consider it be f2p combat be fun and fast pace not too easy not to hard and allow for some room to make character build and if you have friend to play with and choose not to pay money to climb this game could be very extensive on pve term the foundry be one of the good aspect of the game it do not take a computer science degree to understand the fundamental to allow for campaign creation however it do go down quite often which be unfortunate pvp sigh this be the most damaging aspect of the game it have the potential to be great but anyone who play who have not sunke 1k real money into will admit be break unbalanced and pure p2w literally post upon post will say the same thing without a change unless pvp be fix the competetive fan base will dwindle like a candle as it be already and continue until go but in overall opinion it be a fair f2p game but have the potential to be one of the good if handle better,pos
2575,this game be amaze its one of those game that never get old they just keep add more thing to it and its be not a pay to win game some people say it be a pay to win game but i strongly disagree,pos
2576,r3e be really a terrific racing sim it be perhaps launch too early with many feature lacking or function badly but recently though still in beta it have really deliver in my opinion i also have the other two contemporary racing game ac and pc and i must say that i find r3e most fun of these three for example i think bmw m1 procar be even more fun to drive in r3e than it be in pc which i find a blast in pc also r3e be not perfect at least yet but it surely have its strength sound be just awesome and with the recent 9 gb patch they get even well ffb be also good of the three game and it deliver the road feel really well and do not even require hour of tinker with setting to get it right ai be also the most competent of the three by a big margin so r3e be perhaps the good choice for the single player at least until ac and pc improve their ai algorithms graphic be also quite good although not on par with pcar but on the other hand r3e run also very well on my three monitor setup but hey physics be the most important thing no here r3e fare also well physics be not perhaps the most accurate on the planet but still very believable and with awesome ffb i like the driving feel a lot i say it again i think r3e deliver the most fun experience of the three still r3e be by no means arcade racer and lean heavily towards simming side of the genre as say and at the time of writing r3e be still in beta and a work in progress it be still quite polished and offer pretty much full experience already it have no weather or full night but it be otherwise pretty much a full deal imo thing i dislike the most be annoy load time which surely improve with the late patch but be still on the annoying side especially on the menu micropayment system be completely a matter of opionion and it really do not bother me you can have just one experience set and that give you several track and a class of car and that be basically all you need if you want more different pack give good value for money and you get discount for the pack of the item you already may own if you like sim like racing game do not hesitate to try the r3e you can do it for free but of course with very limited option for drive,pos
2577,i love this game even though this game practicaly cost a100 you stil get a great game for not pay the dlc i have lot of fun play it also how be this a adventure a shooter and fps,pos
2578,well smite be moba game that come ou in 2012 and in 2015 get onto steam this time it be all about myhtological god and it position itself as moba that have the third person style gameplay instead of feel like warcraft 3 leftover and yea they keep update it shame that nu wa be not snake babe anymore though nothing that cost money seem to affect gameplay unless unlock god the game also come with easy anticheat with set me off at first after all it be offer separately on steam just for counter strike where it often conflict with valve vac and also take screenshot of your desktop apparently it do it only for cs and everybody else be safe at least it close properly when you close smite aha antiviruse may not like it when instal and set up the game though and well i think that be it be just go to be a generic moba with a camera slap behind the character but nope while there be not much of difference when play melee attack character still be able to hit just one single target and all anything range be a different story you actually have to aim this alone make it much well than dota alike as far as i care there be no warcraft 3 magically home projectile at least for normal attack the ability also have various hit area whether a circle or a line as example there be this neith who have mighty jiggle physics and best ever victory animation her first ability be penetrative arrow first you have have to aim this line down and use the ability after that neith will aim the bow now allow you to change the angle anymore however you be still free to move and thus you be still able to reposition yourself in order to hit the target of course enemy player be not afraid of strafe you slow down when attack so watch out plus a lot of ability be rather smart be something simple yet with multiple usage such as ice elemental tankie golem thing be able to create ice wall have a long range to set it up also the game have jump but it be just a silly animation for those who feel bother not be able to jump when control the character directly developer do not want it to affect gameplay unless exploit or bug the terrain be all flat anyway the game also include the auto feature for both shopping and select ability on level up the latter be not that much need the auto shopping on another hand help new player to just focus on interact with other and fighting when they be not sure if game be worth of their time spend look at all the stat and numerical detail pretty great albeit of course it be not as good as manual build otherwise of course it still have that moba feel it still have tower and creep run along lane the combat flow be still pretty funny in a silly sense at one moment player be attempt to poke each other at range and then in another situtaion they all gang up on each other and nuke area with ability spam in 10 second but hey the game also come with many various mode usual moba big map with three lane the two lane one one lane with small sideway a simple linear path which have random hero selectable about as dumb as deathmatch mode in team game and a small arena mode something for everyone taste otherwise yep the only moba i shall care about so far even if it be not pure moba so that mean that i still sorta do not like mobas but hey whatcha go to do also music rock,pos

2584,i can not tell you how many time i have die in this game and feel not a thimble of anger there be a realism to this game in the sense that you be one soldier of many many other that be wage firefight spread out over a ginormous map there be nothing bind you anywhere other than loyalty to your cause and a will to do what you need to for your faction to secure the target or defend it the openness of be a soldier without order be very liberating and the albeit insanely steep learning curve for accurate shooting and vehicle use lead to immense satisfaction when score a kill or just survive a battle i suggest you play this with a group of friend in the same faction build a squad and use your teamwork as an advantage in battle most other player be lone wolf and can either be pick off when not in a pack or simply outgunne if you walk a tight knit squad down the street with somebody cover every angle and teamspeak run so you know exacly what be go on overall a great game i consider it a benchmark f2p,pos

2587,i start off hate this game due to its massive learning curve and quite frankly that be a good thing to hate about it some people do not want to dedicate a lot time of to one game that be understandable i put 10 15hrs into it across a few week and then uninstalle it a year later i jump back into the game and give it an actual try they add a tutorial after i finish that learn a few thing along the way i start play easy bot practice with a few easy hero the game less complicated than it be on surface once you get go certain thing quickly become easy however certain thing take a long time to learn which be where its learning curve come into play that be where a lot of people include myself at a point be put off by this game lol be an easy alternative but once you break past those first few horrible death fill match of you be confuse as hell and make a ton of mistake the game really start to shine you see the depth the game contain the tactic you start to get suck in if you be anything like me you start find hero that suit your taste that be where the game shine once you have put about 30hrs in you be probably bored of bot match so public match here you come this be where the game be the good and also where it be the bad the game can get very intense if you be with the right people a lot of teamwork will come into play but especially for a newbie this be where the game be at it be bad the community in this game be among the bad i have ever see you will be yell at for make minor or major mistake for some reason they do not realise you be new and they be to at some point you have to start somewhere with dota so with all of the above in mind do you want to start,pos

2590,potentially hundred of player fight over a single location epic squad action for your 12 to 48 close friend near endless upgrade option for free i guess you could spend a few minute play casually be warn even though this game be release back in 2012 it still require a beefy pc setup to run smoothly and even then it be a bit of a cpu hog then again eye candy can always be drop in exchange for some close quarter shoot smoothness just like you do with cs back in the day,pos

2595,early access reviewpros immersive world crafting make sense and be need combat be fun guild play an important role in the game later oncon a lot of the content from jp be yet to be release so you have to be patient if you be intend to buy this do not expect a finished game it be early access as it say if you can live with it i suggest buy it some feature be redundant and not appropriate imho being able to pay in game currency to teleport to dungeon for example summary i genuinely enjoy the game nevertheless i do not think that it be something for the mass market and for player that be use to play mainstream mmo,pos
2596,early access reviewthe game be basically in an alpha stage with how imbalanced the combat be how clunky it feel and how much content be miss maybe come back if this game last long enough for everything to be fix and balance i can not support this game nor recommend this game to anyone until the many issue this game have be fix,neg
2597,i have click my way through a lot of game eventually i always hit a point where the game just stop offer content and be all about number which be when i move on adventure and heroclicker come to mind this one i be literally baffle by how much there be to do and how instead of simply give you a new thing to buy to progress to further tier they give you multiple tool instead what make this game unique be you make build of course some build be well than other but for someone not interested in copy other people it be incredibly fun example relatively early you unlock mercenary they can literally pick any passive from any faction and any two spell but zauren do not that potentially create incredibly op setup yes yes it do and the game intend you to do them and i be constantly refine my merc build or try new one my one regret be start play during an event and now it feel so slow give me back my summer bonus p s autoclicker not require they actually cap autoclick anyway you can and there be a faction around manual clicking but it be not important and that be major to me update still go strong i be bored to tear at this point in hero clicker and still be maybe halfway through the content dragon be finally mine neutral be supreme once more cower mortal,pos

2599,the only reason i do not recommend smite be that it have become very unbalanced over the year and very few good player if any player at all play the game matchmaking take 5 minute to find a game as i have to wait a full half hour to get a conquest match as for the game be unbalanced a handfull of god that have be falsely declaire weak or lack recieve unneeded buff some god who recieve no change already be too strong and can last in a 1v5 fight and most likely win one example be baskura that can use his ult to nuke an entire team with little or no chance of the enemy win another be the morigan as a squishie wort nightmare this mage will sneak up on you without any warning or sight from a ward and kill you instantly and who dosnt love chalk chalk chak whatever this one will tower dive you kill you and a teammate leave heal up to full with his rain and do it all over again no problem and that s my rant,neg

2611,early access reviewthis game be different this game be skillbase now its rng there be so much good about this game that be destroy single handedly by insanely incompetent developer the dev be act delusional not accept have make horrible decision every patch on the testing server that get massive criticism by the community get realease exactly the way it be anyways this ghosttown of a game be the result most thing that make this game special and different be go butcher by the dev patch after patch break and overpowered thing stay in the game for week without be patch and then instead of be adjust they simply get remove completely or replace by something else it just feel like some software programmer get together and make a game that just happen to be brilliant by accident but then they get over confident and think they be brilliant genius who do not have to listen to their community and can just test whatever they want its an alpha i get that but the community be break and so be the core gameplay this be what happen when dev think they be so much smart than everybody else maybe in a few month this game will be playable again but there will not be anyone leave to try it enjoy ur empty game,neg

2616,  single handedly redefine a genre be an amazing feat especially as a f2p game i have play path of exile on and off since it first launch on steam i always could see it be greatness but there be thing put me off like the horrible netcode and desyncs after start again with patch 3 0 i could not resist recommend this game to make it brief it be epic imagine diablo 2 but amplify in every way with dozen of system and mechanic to keep you motivated while the combat feel as responsive and impactful as diablo 3 story path of exile take place in a very unique fantasy set you as the player get strand as an exile on the magical realm of wraeclast which be kinda the game world way of sentence you to death but you be no normal exile and soon discover that you be capable of great power by use mystical gemstone i do not want to go into too much detail but for an action rpg especially a f2p arpg the background be amazingly detailed the story telling be somewhat soul esque with npc item description and randomly spawn audiologs give information to the player which have to be puzzle together to get a comprehensive picture of the history of the world atmosphere set building on the mystical background story the developer have create a dark and grim world for the player to explore objectively there be a huge variation between zone and act while you start on the rough coast of wraeclast you soon move into muddy swamp through dark cavern fight through jungle discover old overrun city and fight in pompous palace the variety be excellent and some area which lead up to certain boss be very rich in atmosphere on the downside i feel that the variation which be definetely there feel not as distinctive as it could since almost all area be somewhat dark and gloomy i get that this be an artistic choice to reenact the style of world that diablo 2 be build but sometimes i catch myself be bore with the sorrounding although they be again objectively speak mastefully craft gameplay on the surface the gameplay of path of exile be cookie cutter arpg run through area click monster to death and get suck into the addiction of find well loot until you hit maximum level and grind the s it out of randomly generate endgame content below this surface there be an unprecedented level of complex system to keep you occupy for starter at the start of your journey you choose between 7 different class but despite genre convention your class choice do not really lock you into skill and playstyle since the active skill be not learnable on a skilltree like most other arpg do you could potentially use every skill the game have to offer with every class you choose at the start every active skill can be drop in the form of gem which then have to be sockete in your equipment to be use and also can be level to increase their power so no skill tree you ask oh boy there be one and when it come to skilltree it be the mother of all skilltree it be enormous complex and challenge the player in way that no other arpg have challenge you before mostly offer passive bonus and playstyle define key ability you have to carefully think about invest your skillpoint but there be always a way for you to switch passive if you feel like you have missplace some point which i feel be an excellent compromise between force the player to make smart choice but also give you the opportunity to correct mistake you may have make currency be also a biiiig part of the game and work different to almost any other arpg instead of gold you can sell item for different orb that you will need for craft and improve your equipment these orb be not only currency between you and the npc but can also be use to trade with other player player trading be vital and the community be very active so you can always spend your time trading with other to get the gear you desire what have to be say though be this path of exile be hard not only be it hard when it come to the challenge of beat it be content and believe me that in itself be a tremendous challenge but it also have a steep learning curve for new player the tutorial they implement work but they be in form of text and the player have to actively read all of the tutorial to understand the mechanic and system luckily the community be helpful and there be excellent video guide on youtube to get you start control the control feel tight responsive in most case which be elementary for arpg in the past i always have my problem with poe since i feel that the netcode be bad that the game have too many lag and desyncs to be thoroughly enjoy i be happy to report that thing have improve a lot most of the time the game feel as direct impactful and responsive as diablo 3 which be king in this regard sometimes there be lag but nothing to worry about in the long run presentation technically path of exile be good most texture be crisp detailed and the animation be fluid and well make some of the later area can even be breathtakingly beautiful but subjectively i personally do not like the artstyle of the game it feel to generic sometimes it even seem to clean while the envoirement be too static for my taste i be bore by the constant darkness and the dim lighting but all of this be subjective and i can not critize the game for my personal taste afaik most people really like the look of the game when it come to sound music i find path of exile to be surprisingly good most sound effect be distinct and impactful while the music play along nicely especially in the npc hub replayability content to sum it up the content be massive you have 7 character each can be level up to 100 which take week of time to reach you also can play every character several time with different build and those build will have unique playstyle there be ton and ton of loot skill gem material and other drop to look for the path of exile team be also very busy when it come to season every new season feature a new mechanic which get implement into the game most new mechanic that have be implement in a season stay in the game to expand the thing you encounter right now the game offer 10 story act split into two half while the second half revisit a lot of the old map while also change a lot and offer up new boss fight aside from the story you have a s itload of stuff you can do so do not worry about content when it come to the f2p part of this game do not worry it be fair you do not have to pay for anything you can play any part of the game for as much as you want for free the only thing you can pay for be cosmetic and some improvement to your stash make collect and sorting item easy for you while i find the price for the skin pet and stash improvement to be quite steep i applaud the developer for this system which be so fair that i spend money on their shop just to show gratitude tl dr prostight responsive control give a visceral and satisfying combat feelingmassive content with potentially hundred of hour of fun to be hadincredibly complexexcellent f2p systemconssubjectively dreary visual while technically soundsteep learning curve for new playershardcore can be frustrating since damage can spike out of nowhere and kill you in an instant recommendation if you like arpg and be willing to dive into a very complex game you will have hundred if not thousand of hour of fun with this one,pos
2617,with over 125 hour in the pocket it be safe to say i know what i be talk about probably pro massive battle fun with your friend form a squad or platoon with your mate infinite replayability continent unlock again everything except cosmetic can be buy with ingame certscon friendly fire system lock your gun for 5 minute it be bind to happen sometimes when friendly just run into your explosive or infront of your vehicle can not make my character look cool without buy cosmetic with real cashit be a great game i recommend to my friend it be really fun when you play with your friend or join an outfit highly recommend,pos

2622,i have play on the launcher before so i have a lot of experience with the game pretty fun card game for newcomer to card game also enhance the fun even more for eld scroll fan i think es legends be a way well game than hearthstone since the game have a lot more go on in the board besides that there be way less rng decide game and depend more on strategy to win solo arena be also a pretty fun addition to es l compare to hearthstone pretty good game overall,pos
2623,hear story of dungeon dragon seem epic and i love the concept i have never play the card game with anyone and when i stumble upon this game i be quiet amazed i have experience many mmo from wow to a million of other title but i have never really engage in them since all of them seem similar to wow all of them be reflection of what wow become and it seem pointless play other mmo this be a whole other story the character creation stage of the game do not amaze me although read backround story about each race be quite nice choose the back story of your now ready adventure be also unique allow you to rolepay and bond with your fighter as weird as that sound with these sort of game it be hard to see the thing that make you stay from the very beginning but the main reason behind all the hour that i put into the game be because of the combat system you do not have a million spell compress into hotkey that make you smash your keyboard at any important battle here you have a limited amount of tab of spell available at one time it be easy to handle and easy to get a hold of have such limited access to a wild root of spell prepare you to make serious choice but also allow you to develop your own way of battle with a few class which be quiet special and make the game more enjoyable you may have a friend that be a priest like you but he may be a engaging in battle priest obv not a tank whereas you may be a support priest heal him have a group of friend that be all of a different class be obviously the good resolution allow you to see how all the class engage in battle and how all the class can work together to reach the same goal the opportunity be endless and with no time limit on how long you have to spend play you can be decide your own way of fight technique in your own very way for some time that be the main reason i stay and i be not vouch for anybody else the game be more enjoyable not well by any mean when play with your friend dwell in deep dangerous dungeon with a group of close companion sound like a dream and if that be what you be look for in a game then neverwinter should be your choice there be a large number of dungeon from an early level with them get more advanced as you advance the monster get tough and more big with each new dungeon available each dungeon end with a final gigantic boss which you should find challenging they range from demented soul to dragon but yeah that be just a small ounce of the game if you be try to find out more about the game the good advice i can give be to actually play the game because stream and record video can not capture the full essence of the game by no mean be i an expert in this game but i hope that this help the newcomer that be try to get in the game,pos

2625,early access reviewtl dr pros fun gameplay that be not too simple and not too complex incredibly generous f2p model con lengthy and lackluster tutorial campaign that you have to play through to get to other play mode interesting lore but it do not really come through from play the gamein depth review so i play hearthstone for about 2 year with the goal of spend no money on it after that time around journey to ungoro i feel like hearthstone be at the point where i could no longer build any deck that be fun to play without either invest both a ton of money and a ton of time i have be play eternal on and off since a little over halfway through the close beta but at that point i switch over to it as my dcg of choice i really like this game for 2 main reason 1 it be simple than mtg but more complex than hearthstone i really like mtg but i do not really like have to physically go to a place and interact with people in order to play it especially if they be non casual mtg player i do not much like the large amount of rng in hearthstone eternal be the perfect blend of be simple enough to be represent as a dcg but complex enough that it be as enjoyable as mtg it feel like it have enough rng to make thing varied but not so much that it start to make your decision feel less meaningful 2 i feel like i can build deck that be fun to play without have to spend any money i generally play this game for about 1hr a day on the train on the way to and from work so in reality my hour play be probably a decent amount high than steam report i feel like the deck i be able to make at low tier be still fun to play and after several month of focused playing i be able to make some of the budget upper tier deck at this point i can pretty easily get to the high rank each month and can make about half of the tier 1 deck i have spend no money to get card since i start play this game i have spend some money for cosmetic effect in game since i want to support the developer which be not something i feel inspire to do with hearthstone some thing i do not like about this game as many have probably say the tutorial campaign be sort of bore that alone would not be so bad but you have to play through it completely before you can do anything else i wish that you only have to play through a few tutorial game and then you gain access to the other mode of play as then you would be able to bounce back and forth between mode and it would greatly help avoid thing get bore i think there be some interesting lore to this game underneath the surface but you have to sort of dig for it it do not come across very strongly from just play the game i be not sure why it still early access on steam the game now have 3 full set and 2 expansion think hearthstone adventure and it be definitely not a game that would be consider in beta i can not really think of any additional feature or polish that this game would require in order that would warrant it be consider fully release,pos

2641,i have put a few lap down in this sim and through my experience i have see many thing improve with the addition of vr it have become my favorite racing simulator con no night or rain pricing model many people be turn away by individual pricing but car and track be always be add and with the purchase of the premium pack you can own all 70 very detailed and well make car and 42 track for 85 while iracing be 100 per year subscription pro amazing sound quality very few game come close to the crisp popping of the afterfire and dynamic of the engine in this sim excellent physics i find the physics to be very logical for the most part i love the way the brake work and weight transfer many sim seem to have the philosiphy of more unstable more realistic great force feedback i have read many review complain about the control and force feedback but use the logitech g29 this be one of the good force feedback engine i have ever use grant my setting be heavily tweak do not expect the control to be perfect without mapping or adjust the setting just like a race car need to be set up for a circuit your wheel need to be set up for specific task entire licensed motorsport series this sim containst all track and car for the official deutsch tourenwagen masters championship from 2013 2016 and even include classic dtm car from the early 90 r3e also include wtcc 2013 2017 adac gt masters gt3 and a dozen other motorsport series you will not find in most sim always improve since the game have launch r3e have go from a hotlapping sim to a full fledged multi series experience like no other car and track be always be improve regardless of age i be a bit surprised in some way to see mixed review but give the pricing model it be understandable but give comparison to iracing it be very affordable especially combine with the premium pack that unlock everything for less than what forza a couple dlc cost,pos
2642,it be a waste of time i get fool by this game you start of with no money like any other game which be fine but they only allow you to hunt one kind of animal in one location each kill can give you up to 100 point if your lucky to unlock hunting right license the cheap one be 850 for only 24 hour whether or not you in the game to get one kill take about 2 hour if you know what your do cause walk and running be this game be pretty slow and you have no vehicle the game map be vary large weapon in this game be exstreamly over price 2 000 to 14 000 at least it be permanent you also need to buy ammo gear utility item some be reuseable some need to be refill very realistic great grafic ect but there be noticeable problem with the game that your just go to have to discover for yourself last thing control though few be very different from anyother game most people have ever play,neg
2643,early access reviewthis be probably the most dissapointing game i have play the old game its so different it could easily be a different game have fun challenging gameplay but now they have scrap that idea and have make it the exact defenition of a pay to play this include overpower weapon that 1 shoot new player impossibly large sum of money require to get anything at all premium get twice as many item from crate as non premium play in a match with a premium do not give you additional money like it use to i could go on for hour the large problem i have encounter be player attach a really op weapon to their robot but nothing else and lower their cpu enough to get into new player match mean that they will always win and gain easy loot this mainly occur with the new aeroflak cannon which in early game destroy any ground target even though the weapon be design to be an anti aircraft gun secondly the insane cost of item so you play a match come first in the team and win gain a protonium crate and gain some stuff you do not want so you sell it and gain maybe 300 money now you want to buy something oh wait you can not because even the cheap gun cost 400 and sell item get you less than a tenth of what you can buy it for in some case so you play another match but there be someone with an aeroflak by the way do i mention that the aeroflak cost 75 000 to buy but that s not even the most expensive item there be the lock on rocket launcher another commonly use cheat weapon cost 125 000 to buy and i bet that leave you wonder but how do i get that well the sad answer be you do not or at least without spend more money anyway you obviously loose and get a rusty case and inside you find some more junk this have basically describe what the game feel like for non premium but wait what if you be a premium well other than cost a ton of money a single day cost a1 it be very good access to all the paint yes that s only for premium twice the item from crate custom profile pic ect all of this have lead this game to be very pay to play and it feel as if the developer just do not care enough anymore to change it they have get too greedy with money to think be this a good fun game 1 10 huge dissapointment,neg

2645,early access reviewthis game although fun at time be frustrating and extremely grindy how many battle must i play before i can even rank up once it be so hit and miss soviets appear to be overpower and there be so much grenade spam this be because you get four grenade per life gunplay be interesting but it be so annoying that you have to sink multiple shot into somebody before they die this game have a lot of potential they could bring it out by make it easy to progress edit so i manage to reach rank 5 after around 25 hour of gameplay grinding on my german character i be greet with a panzer i ausf a not exactly great but i can not start with a tiger can i then i meet a m5a1 stuart this game be so absurdly unbalanced when you reach tier 2 it be unbelievable how poorly design it be one of the bad thing be that once one of your soldier get to tier 2 it automatically put all of your other soldier into tier 2 it mean that my rank 2 american infantry can enter game with sturmgewehr 44s and tiger iis destroy him which actually happen heres a gif that demonstrate it well to mention the awful balancing you can have a team full of panzer be and they will have m5a1 stuarts and more plus what be with this another thing since some random update the developer decide that they would increase the already monotonous grind by make item more expensive and up the rank require to play certain thing for example the tank crewman use to be unlock at rank 3 but when i start play it be change to rank 5 for what reason oh wait there be not a single reason except they want more money how surprising that be just one example it appear that there be many more i do not simply have the patience for this atrocity i would find great enjoyment in staple my testicle into the floor and stick scissor in my eye,neg

2649,i play this game quite a bit back in 2017 on the phone i have enough hour for this game to properly review it duel link be meh if you be a fan of yugi oh i would give it shoot the card battle be short and the music voice acting be top notch my issue be that it be tedious require constant check up to gain exp and money to buy card by battle npc the double edged feature they include be an auto feature that play for you while a cool idea and allow you to quickly take out npc the game turn into an idle game another card game hearthstone make you fight npc and then throw you into the fray against enemy player to gain more exp the reason i be bring this up be because in hearthstone the fight be reward when you win against an enemy player i wish there be an option to fight hard npc from the get go as the ranked play in this game be full of salt most fight have revolve around have certain card with giant effect i remember one match where the dude already have three monster out on the second turn and one of them could negate set trap card and spell card i could not find the motivation to continue learn about all the card the game offer this game do have a few interesting mechanic when opening card you can go through an entire box and get all the card as long as you do not reset the box if you pay a fix price you can get all the card in the box or go at it one pack at a time and still gain the card i recommend not reset the box as it will mess up your chance you can also buy prebuilt deck to use the game also have a small pool of card take from each gen of yugioh no t like monster reborn or exodia so the developer do consider balance in some way there be multiple character with different ability to choose from which allow for a variety of benefit with your character and card my issue be that there be too many card as of writing there be more than ten box to go through and all of the card be usable in ranked play so you do not know what to expect when jump in a match i also have my account delete when i have this on my phone i have pegasus and quite a good amount of card to play with what i like voice act music and quick battle what i do not like auto feature energy system ton of card no lock meta,neg

2670,i know a lot of people do not like these type of game that show up because mobile game belong on mobile however i would like to try to convince you guy that this one be an exception i play several month of the mobile version of this game and hope to at least make those of you on the fence curious enough to give it a shot yu gi oh be a pretty reknown franchise that strike most of us as kid some young some old for me i be about 10 year old get ready for a cheerleading performance i do not miss be a cheerleader and i have enough time to watch the premiere episode of yu gi oh on tv i have enjoy the series and game ever since although some of the more complicated type of card disappoint me slightly coughpendelumscough yu gi oh duel link be effectively take the mobile game generation and bam and combine certain attribute to get a surprisingly entertaining hit from konami for the first time in a while outside of console game effectively cut the base yu gi oh game in half by limit the field of 5 monster and spell trap zone to 3 deck size from 40 60 to 20 30 and everyone start with 1 less card save that you start second as per the new ruling beyond that and a limitation of certain card that make the original game a fix meta and you have a surprising hit with some special cameo from well know character that play out as the original would otherwise play as your favorite character as you want i be sell by my ability to play as and start as seto kaiba himself some may prefer yami yugi or mako or mai or joey or hell even friggen bandit keith in america and with the recent release of the ever so popular yu gi oh gx series character card and map you have more option to play and for the most part next to no limitation in which card you want to use for which character now to the imporant question like what about ban list yes konami be in the process of add a ban list for certain card now that there be a large pool for player to work with however it be literally patch in a few week ago and may take time for them to adjust to the current meta what about insert archtype they get add in usually when a character know to use say archtype appear in the game most recently they have jesse anderson run around with obtainable crystal beast card your favorite archtype be likely already there if not on the way be there a strong deck type right now yep the common one i see a lot be blue eye white dragon deck use seto kaiba warrior deck use joey wheeler fire king use by whoever you think would utilize them the most i personally have be use chazz prinston ojama deck recently with fly success follow by use yugi moto for geminis be there any major problem with the game that exist before the port sadly yes thankfully it be the only know problem to mention and you guess it spam bot in the chat konami recently update their tos that make me think that they may be consider a strong action against these illegal spam bot promoter but i have yet to see any action yet however remove bot from a game or any other platform can be an uphill battle especially if they have be there for a while be there any issue with the steam version of this game no bug that i know of konami seem to be frequently keep an eye on the game status and bug and be active to update and fix them i personally wish they would allow for me to fix the screen resolution i be currently use a 1366x768 resolution but the game screen be slighly large then that with no option to resize or anything i be play on the mobile version prior as well but i do not wan to start a new game can i sync my datum yep just click data transfer on the start screen and make sure you have a konami account from the website that the game redirect you to i have already sync mine and it work really well be it pay to win depend on how you see it the game use a premium currency of gem as a means to buy card however say gem can be earn pretty reliably by just play the game pay for thing like duel orb be not even necessary in my opinion or extra deck slot the card package that can be buy for real money however be up for debate because while they offer the same card you would get for play the game normally they can be obtain faster by buy them and there be certain package deal that reward you gem and sometimes an sr card certainty for buy them i personally do not think it be pay to win because you can earn all the same card that everyone else can some effort and time require for event only card not everyone feel the way i do though and it be understandable if you guy have any other question and concern regard the game feel free to ask and please be sure to give this game a fair shot it be worth the time promise 3,pos

2687,team fortress 2 be at heart a gloriously simple game that be be create with style panache and an undeniable love of gaming it be the kind of game that you want to show to people who do not play game so that they understand and then either get involve or go away there be life before team fortress 2 and there be life after after be well,pos
2688,it make me sad to see people say this be pay to win there be nothing in this game that you have to buy there be convenience item and nothing actually give you an advantage over other player i have be play this game since back when there be only 4 class and it have evolve and play beautifully the item that you can buy on the shop be cosmetic and quality of life to put it simply there be costume which grant be expensive but you do not need them at all they give very minor stat to your character and some of the late game armor that you can easily obtain look well anyway there be also pet and mount which be just quality of life item that give you an easy and lazy pve experience the only thing that i can say be a usual must pay be the second b slot which should not be a pay thing but if you be go to enjoy and play the game a lot then what be 8 other than that you do not have to buy anything i have never expand my inventory or bank space and i get by just fine and happy now to the gameplay it be an extremely unique mmorpg that combine 2d side scroll with 3d element it have a unique combo system between it be attack button and skill and each character feel unique and able to customize to your play style each character currently in the game have 3 job to choose from each of which greatly alter your character play style all and all the game pve be superb and i would recommend this game to anyone who be look for a unique and well put together mmo now for the pvp it be a very fun experience whether you be casual or hardcore go into it it be very skill base and require you to have a deep understanding of your character and the character your go against it come in the form of 1v1 2v2 3v3 and a base race game mode where it fall short sometimes be it be balance play some character against other can be overwhelming for one side and frustrating at time but it be nothing that practice and effort can not solve the big issue that i have have with this game be latency there will be random moment in pve where i will be attack a monster and it will not register any damage for several second and this same deal can happen in pvp along with an enemy lag teleport around but it all usually sort itself out overall i believe that this be a great mmo that have grow beautifully and have the potential to stay amazing for year to come and i would reccomend it to anyone look for something new,pos
2689,early access reviewfracture space be a great game not really innovative but good it be a refresher from the constant first person style shooter and the crappy yearly release i love it and would reccommend it to anyone,pos
2690,  enjoyable in short burst for a long time i stop play nw because it be an unoptimized piece of grabo and cryptic be not all that interested in fix it i have return after more than six month to nw and i get to say its a pretty fun f2p mmo take in small dose the combat be fast paced and satisfying plus after a longtime the game be finally optimize and you can properly enjoy it it should run at 50 60fps on most pc even in more crowded area although its base on the forget realm d d set this game be nothing like its tabletop counterpart or neverwinter night for that matter nw be an action mmo through and through your character have no alignment to speak of so you can choose whatever class you fancy without a worry in the world except for the fact that some race work better for some class the voice acting be decent the music be pretty good graphic be acceptable well than most f2p mmo on the market just do not go into this game expect the next big thing if you be not willing to spend any money on this game then i would suggest you stay away from pvp as a non pay player you will not be on equal footing with those that decide to pay for some cash shop item that make your life much easy or those who have play aton as a side note you be able to convert astral diamond a currency you get from different in game activity into zen the premium currency that can also be buy with your hard earn to buy stuff from the cash shop but the rate be not all that great another problem for free player be that we be limit to 2 character slot per account which be kinda and the only way to get more be with zen on the other hand you can make and use as many free account as you like what s more 3 race be lock behind game pack that go for 49 99 for the moon elf 69 99 for the dragonborn and 189 99 for the menzoberranzan renegade the pack also include some mount a char slot each and some otherthat not all that useful as for pve its pretty entertaining albeit repetitive once you hit max lvl your main goal be to obtain some artifact and do the campaign which mostly consist of do daily quest get some resource which you will use to research some passive skill for your character the quest you do be not all that memorable but at least they be not very long so you will not have to spend too much time with em recently they have also introduce a system that make the campaign faster for an alt but i have not spend much time with it so i can not say how much faster they really be all in all if you can look past its flaw which be quite a few nw be a pleasant way to spend your spare time mindlessly kill monster and grind some gear,pos
2691,i would not recomend this game for anyone with a low income source this game may be free to play but it be for sure pay to win and it take forever to level up in this game the company that back this game up be just horrible they do not care for the player want they do what they think will benefit the game as a source of major income the character be extremely unbalanced if you like pvp it have decent pvp i be not go to lie about that but you will need to max your character and get the good equipment to have any chance of survive in the arena if you want a game that be good this be definatly not the game you would want to pick,neg

2694,early access reviewso far it seem like a fun game although i have only complete the tutorial since i be unable to join any game at the moment the graphic could use a touch up and the game would benefit from some true anti aliasing option but what be present now be a step in the right direction the gameplay be fun so far some good voice act from the ai and the sound design be pretty spot on thus far appreciate that they have make the game free as well and do not really mind the microtransaction because of this this be one of the only game in alpha that i believe will actually leave it,pos
2695,review update first impression kinda mixed about this one while it be definitely well than hearthstone aka rnjesus stone it be kinda bad than magic the gathering so i will rate this as neither a great nor a bad game to get second thought edit thought behind the rating below final rating this game look promising to begin with first impression be mix with a rating of 4 75 10 although it have some positive element the reviewer can not really state that he be impressed by the game and its core element the collection be ok but nothing be impressive to any degree this feel like another game to be forget within the next couple of month the only positive element be the graphic which prevent the inevitable 0 0 10 rating this time i rate this game as 3 5 10 which mean that i strongly advice people not to play this game even though it be free to play it be simply not worth it there be well alternative 1 gameplay 1 0 3 5the two lane system be by no mean unique mmdoc have a three lane system and it still fail in the long run due to yolo expansion come out es l have some balance yet the card pool be very limited at the moment 0 5 and the majority of the effect be hijack from other ccgs it be inevitable but still a point to consider while create a game 1 5 as i have collect 70 of the baseset it become increasingly depressing to watch so 0 5 this start to look very much like hearthstone unfortunately but it be nevertheless true 2 graphic aesthetic 2 5 3 0the graphic of es l be very well craft although i have only play this game for a very limited period of time the voice over be adequate but a bit tiresome in the long run so 1 0 for that one at least the animation be much well than hearthstone an extra 0 5 from that aspect 3 uniqueness 0 0 1 5my apology to all es player but this game be by no means a unique game in the ccg genre and no those prophecy just simply do not make the cut my friend nothing else to say compare to magic the gathering you all know it be come anyway so i will leave it there 4 replayability 0 00 2 0as with all game replayability be important if you want to keep the playerbase at a decent size i fear that this game do not have that much to offer atm if you want a casual ccg with rng as a major factor then you should turn to hearthstone while the grand old ccg magic the gathering have everything that suit a grand strategist need so 1 5 from these consideration but i still have some faith in the future development of this game so if the developer be aware of the competitive ccgs out there they may increase the replayability value for es l through several tweak this thought give a slight bonus as i be currently in a good mood 0 25 update nope the start hand size be a joke and game decide as the ring so unfortunately i have to give 0 75 for this,neg
2696,i like this game and play it a lot on google chrome i recently get it on steam and have have a huge reminder of how hard it be to really have fun without make micro transaction lot of grinding be need to advance further in the game but the multiplayer be fun its free to play so do not expect anything amazing unless you be willing to pay perfect to pass time 7 5 10,pos

2699,early access reviewgame feel like a major cash grab be really hope for an mmo and it certainly be an mmo it look fairly decent but run awfully while do so on a 5820k 4 7 and 1080 i be get 100 fps farming with no one around me after ini fix pvpe against 10 people dip me down to 30 constantly with stutter occur far too often the main reason i buy this game be pvp at it be current state there be no arena rank honor point system work it be bug currently among glaring balance problem while i can not speak for 100v100 i can safely assume it be nearly unplayable leveling be fine around 30 it start slow quite a bit and force me to take quite a bit of side quest i hope for nothing more than this game success in it be current state though i can not recommend anyone spend it be current pricetag the dev have not make this game a labor of love which be what i be hope for the glaring problem from previous version be still glare problem now after year of development and in production i be really hope for a new renovation of the game i really do not get anything i be hope for i highly suggest you look at something like gw2 that be free to play and essentially do what this game do but well tactic be essentially weaponset in gw2 and each have utility skill you can manipulate skill also combo in gw2 linearly instead of separate chain regardless of this i feel the system be much more polished and playable,neg
2700,definitely worth try i use to play hearthstone and few other card game and this one be really decent but sadly not perfect it have very enjoyable campaign with card upgrade system i really enjoy it a lot of interesting interaction between card with clear description basically you do not have to alt tab and google what specific passive on the card do its all in the game display nearby card in separate window it be a lot easy to get good deck in tes legend compare to hearthstone and ofc f2p the only bad thing be the same unbalanced and stupid rng system that most card game use basically all your card come in random order which itself can ruin your game even in first turn this be really boring and i be surprise they do not do any improvement to reduce amount of rng related to get card for example they could at least let player choose 2 card which they will always start with and 2 random the next logical step should be give us option to pick half card by yourself and half random instead of throw random only except situation where you use special action to choose 1 card and throw 2 other away really just too much rng be the only problem with these kind of game,pos

2706,back in the 1990 and early 2000 you would call this thing a free demo the amount of dlc be laughable and they have naturally make sure that any car or track you would reasonably recognise be dlc so assume this game be price at 51 99 for the full package it be absolutely not worth it the car be not enjoyable to drive the physics be not particularly accurate the ui for controller be abysmal and the graphic while good in some place be overall pretty poor at this price go and buy assetto corsa you will get well value for money,neg

2712,overall a pretty polished game the background be detailed enough to look nice without give off massive lag the character animation look natural and most of the dragon look great like all free to play game there be many part of the game that be block off until you purchase them unlike many other game of its kind you can get access to most of the content without pay a dime there be many load screen but you be go to come across those with any unity game or even 3d game for that matter again for a free game you get a lot more than you pay for,pos
2713,while the prospect of get more elder scroll lore while wait on the next mainline game to come out may seem attractive legend be not worth the hassle it be a hearthstone clone more or less pleagued by the same rng and money grab issue thatp lague all ccgs every element of the game be rig to extort money from you if you want a remotely competitive deck as with all ccgs be prepare to blow 100 on card pack so you can rng the card you need or get the dust you need to craft them the non pay content will last you a few hour at most and then the game will begin demand money for a few more hour which will be deplete after you chew through it because they only have a few content pack out now all of which be hideously overpriced because the people who do spend money on ccgs buy the pack 40 at a time because as psychological research have show us ccgs and other microtransaction scheme be tailor to prey on whale people with compulsive personality disorder or poor impulse control who can not resist the urge to see what come out of that next pack or what card come off the top of their deck next they be biologically predispose to take risk minimize loss overstate their gain and keep pull any lever or push any button that make pleasant noise or flash pretty light at them game dev know this so they make their game to milk these whale for their money legend be no different beyond the hideously exploitative pricing model the game itself be the usual rng garbage that all ccgs be you can be mop the floor with someone and be up 20hp one turn then the next they luck into a card combo that win them the game likewise you can be struggle all game against someone and then rng hand you the perfect card to turn the game around while stiffe your opponent there be very little personal skill or tactical thinking involve the personal skill element boil down to make a balanced deck and make wise trade in the game that be maybe 30 of what determine who win and who lose another 10 be probably the rock paper scissor game design philosophy that play out like deck that spawn lot of small enemy lose to deck that spawn big enemy lose to deck with a lot removal lethality lose to deck with lot of small enemy the other 60 be all luck plain boring dumb luck i can not recommend this or any other ccg ever if you love these game seek help instead there be treatment for gambling addiction,neg

2738,this be a free to play public game my friend want me to play and i play this game for 5 year as a married and work man listen me guy i play mainly support or roamer and what i see be 15 funny game win or lose rest be get flame after lose or see commend me guy type of guy if your team win what i say be this be a great game absolitely good game but you know lot of the player want to be satisfy else then gameplay and fun i decide not to pick support and see what happen and it be all chaos and flame maybe on my mmr i be not high mmr player i be not pro but everyone be here be miracle or rtz yes sometimes people say it my bad and sorry if you do not have nothing else to do then uninstall this game and you will find a thing to do this be just waste of time if you do not make money of this game just play it and count how many time it make you happy or upset i know ill miss this game becasue its the good 5v5 game in the world for me but somehow you find yourself in mmr race and aim to go high do your good and win but somehow not fun you play it for the win win win win or flame or flame even if you say someone really nicely hey come let go there do this you be get flame 85 percent on my mmr so this be a very very good game but we be not that good as human it seem i even see my lifetime friend flame and argue each other for this game so this be not for me have fun in mmr race if you play this game just think about why people put money in it and try to increase player number its all about player community and money they make why you release a free to play game,neg
2739,team fortress 2 be a great game with a great community what i love about this game be the large variety of style class and way tp play each class not to mention the large amount gamemode i would recommend this game to anyone who be a gamer 3 love this game,pos
2740,update 6 1 14updated again 5 4 18war thunder sound great on paper but the gameplay in this game be total garbage the combat be awful since 95 of player will likely just play in arcade mode if you get someone tail you you be do i have try every move in the air combat book and nothing work this make this the most infuriating game to play because you can not escape a plane behind you you literally need someone else to shoot them and good luck get help from random player the control be also terrible i do not know what sick joke people play by tell people mouse mode be good but it be awful you do not have a direct feel for how much you be bank at any give moment and it be very difficult to get the reticle to line up for a lead shoot most game you will just spend your time circle an enemy or if you try for a head on engagement you will likely be ram as death by plane collision be extremely common and some try to do it on purpose take out a bomber which be hard to shoot down by ram it the playerbase be not very helpful and no one really help out you be most likely to be greet with lol l2plane verbatim if you ask question the realistic and simulator mode resolve some of these issue but the game control still feel bad in mouse mode my joystick have not arrive yet but base on comment from many in the community mouse mode be easy than joystick mode so i doubt honestly it will get much well with a joystick there be far less player in the realistic and simulator mode as well balancing be also an issue there be some entire nation which perform far below other most player would say to play russian and british plane and avoid axis plane because they be not too good at the starter tier the chaika a soviet plane be the most decry overpowered plane in the game a high turn rate biplane which fire 4 deadly cannon at a very rapid rate which can quickly take out the other plane at the tier and even many that be high than it matchmaking will suddenly ramp the difficulty up for you significantly and start introduce you to many bomber and fighter as well as many strong ground target which need large bomb to take out at this point you have nothing but light gun to shoot at ground target and light bomb this mean you will be force to slug it out with the strong plane which you will likely lose to since they have superior gun the overall process of get to your next plane be very painful and do not feel well implement there be many thing you can research but the game present them in a haphazard way that do not make much sense some tier 1 plane can not be research but then other can and after a random other plane be research then a new one can be research that be in no way relate the game research tree be confusing as much of the rest of the game be even to someone who know what to look for i spend a fair amount of time try to give this game a chance and it be just the most frustrating game experience i have have would not recommend at all if you be look at this compare to wargaming game this be way more pay to win model as you do not get any free xp rp in this game and with the premium currency you could easily skip up to a high tier plane i have play maybe 50 75 match and i have 50k free rp that if i spend premium currency on i could unlock probably a tier 3 plane the game have 5 tier with multiple plane within the same tier this game strongly reward those who spend money far more than a wargaming game and it will likely prove frustrating for a player that be not hardcore into air combat and be honestly not that satisfy for someone who be interested in air combat give realistic and simulator mode be the mode you would want to always choose a sidenote about those mode too the match be very long the timer for realistic match more realistic than arcade but not as hardcore as simulator be 60 minute to the generally 15 25 minute timer for arcade match the arcade mode to me just feel very off and the difficulty curve into the realistic mode be much high which make it more difficult to grind for your next plane updateso i have hear about the ground combat i decide to try it out and see if that be any well of course world of tank be the first thing to compare it to you start out in a lowly tank with a weak gun but you face similar tank and all be fairly fun arcade mode numb down the difficulty a bit too much since you can immediately see where the enemy tank be even if they be in heavy cover realistic mode be a bit too punishing though unfortunately if you be moderately decent at all you get up tiered because of your skill level very quickly and then you will be face off against tank you can not hurt so you will find yourself cornered on map with no teammate team work in this game be somehow even more non existant than world of tank likely due to the large map and spread out goal often time flank the enemy tank and shoot the rear do not even work after a dozen match of lose and be wipe out with minimal xp gain i just give up again you also get to worry about plane bomb you at any moment as if the overpowered tank you can not hurt be not enough gaijin be never go to improve this game clearly they have decide they want their game to be this realistic game that they will not back down from once again realistic mode be far more sparsely populated than arcade though and i think this be a huge mistake arcade mode be basically what world of tank be though it have more enjoyable gameplay war thunder grind combat be sloppy and feel like a mess this game be a pretty big download and an even big disappointment for all the hype it receive if you want ground combat stick to world of tank though i can not honestly recommend that anymore teamplay be so awful there that match be rarely fun anymore we be sorely lack a good game in this space now but the choice be to make do with gaijin and wargaming very mediocre game or do without frankly i would rather do without these be just exercise in frustration and time waste 5 4 18 update so the plane combat be still awful tank combat feel a little well than before but the entire way this game play be awful i stop play world of tank a few year ago due to decline in its quality but look like war thunder be die off and be do much bad do not waste your time on this game there be just nothing of value gain from it i feel rip off of the time i waste on this even for free,neg

2745,note this be an update review i have take down my previous not recommend one a while back i have such a severe love hate relationship with this game but this one will remain i have be with this franchise since 1999 hour play on here be so far off due to play for so many year off of steam with my love of the franchise you will not get a biased review here in fact i do not even always know why i recommend this game and yes i know how commentor work if i have this many hour in a game how can it not be recommend quite frankly because this be not the same game i use to play all those hour this be an mmo and mmos change but i recommend this game to an extent the beginning and first few expansion be great but then i think there be only 1 word to describe how the game become bloated they seem to add more feature for advancement than actual content sometimes it feel as if they be try to give the illusion that there be more content than their really be kunark ascend try do that with the epic 2 0 weapon you will be do more in old content than current content to gain that weapon and i be talk content that be much low than you i do not mind work for a weapon that be the good in slot for 2 ish year but their be not much in the way of new content to do i know i do not speak for everyone but i feel this be a game that only get bad if you rush it there be over 8 000 quest in this game but expansion only add in the double digit these day if you be a quester if you want to adventure i can only recommend this game if you do not rush because once you get to the end game you will see many illusion of content so why recommend this game the content that be there be fairly good it suck that it end so quickly at end game but the grind will at least be real if you want that but i mainly recommend the start and the first few expansion after that it just get bloated but some people do enjoy that this be just my 2 cent i do not expect everyone to agree with me but you can get hundred if not thousand of hour out of this game on 1 character and not be able to do everything unless you rush and only focus on the last couple expansion but grinder can get those hour i be just speak of unique content not repeat,pos

2751,woo boy this be go to be a fun review tldr at the end this be a good game it really be there be so much i want to say about it so i will get start graphically this game be amazing not because it be hyper realistic but because the art style be unique to a point where it be almost impossible for it to look aged this game be ten year old and still look great gameplay wise it be fun you run around you shoot people on the opposite team it be not always shoot bullet though there be 9 class each with their own unique weapon there be rocket launcher grenade launcher and flamethrower there be a variety of unique secondary weapon to be have as well even the class that use gun have unique gun to use the different class be play in a variety of different way so there be probably a favorite class for everyone and then there be character design i could probably gush about this for hour but i will not each character be recognizable simply by their silhouette they be all very unique to the point that each character model have its own unique tooth and ear then each character have their own unique set of weapon that usually follow a theme the scout main weapon be all scattergun the heavys main weapon be all minigun etc these character not only have unique design but unique personality and unique background too just listen to the voice line they say as you play the game will give you an idea of their personality it be so cool to see a game like this give its character so much personality and the character be even expand on in comic_strip that you can view online for free the character could probably be describe as extreme and even ridiculous but this somehow make them feel more real and more enjoyable there be probably something to be say about diversity here especially because of its competitor overwatch there be no dancing around it this game be simply not as diverse in character gender and ethnicity as overwatch be however the character present in this game have far more personality than the character present in overwatch i have play overwatch before and unlike this game be not enthral by the character with this game i be almost immediately draw in because of the character themselves not just the gameplay sadly however woman design be once upon a time make for this game but for whatever reason be scrap they be very unique design too and if the team actually have follow through on make them and have apply the same effort they do for their male character they would have make some of the good dang female character in game i be go to apologize about the overwatch comparison but i be still salty about blizzard make half bake female character and then be tout as progressive when they be really just play the middle to attract the most player the tf2 character designer could make woman character that would crush overwatch in every way if they ever decide to do that there be also something to be say about the community it suck big time if you be a woman or have a high pitched voice you be probably well off not use the voice chat at least in casual mode if you do you will probably get sexist comment hurl at you or if they just think you have get a high pitched voice call a squeaker and may even get kick a lot of people in casual mode also type a bunch of racist sexist homophobic and every ist and phobic thing in the book into the chat it be painful to read but hey it sure be fun get domination on homophobe and then taunt after kill them so that be something you can do of course it be not all bad and most game of this nature end up with a community like that anyway so it be no surprise really there be a bunch of good folk out there too i have meet some good folk through this game and if you play it for long enough you will too just do not be surprised about the bad folk plus there be a bunch of different sub community that be usually full of nice people tldr it be a good game and it be free to pick up and play so you have get nothing to lose but your time it be fun have a bad overall community but nice little sub community unique and fun character and a lot of cool map play it and have fun,pos
2752,early access reviewgreat gameplay and teamwork the different type of ship you can earn make it dynamic right now the only multiplayer mode be 5x5 and the game take about 15 25 minute it will be interesting to see different arena and map type later on note to player you can not be a hero in this game you need to pay attention to what your team be do and figure out your place be a support ship and either heal a large attack or defense ship or sacrifice yourself to steal an enemys ground can make all the difference so do not knock what seem like a less role off the table without give it a try sometimes glory be achieve in unexpected way during this game which give it great potential i pay the 20 for the vanguard founder pack because i enjoy the game and want the dev to earn what they deserve let us hope they continue to do the job right,pos

2779,early access reviewa nice attempt to create a proper tcg yet fail with bad design choice that enforce rng even more than need mechanic wise i prefer the game over it be competitor like hearth stone but a major issue that i have with this game be the way they design the resource system why in the world would you want to have your resource in form of card in your actual deck that poorly craft design increase the rng that tcgs have to deal with even more than require cause not only do you have to make sure to draw the right card you also have to make sure now to not draw resource if not need and vice versa could be an amazing tcg but fail due to a very stupidly design fundamental mechanic,neg

2830,this be my first review and i can easly say that i do recommend this game for everyone before anything it be an eld scroll game and this be already a reason to try it even if you do not like card game you should give this one a chance the art work on this game be perfect absolutely amazing the way the game mechanic work make him a very fun and very different on this gender you can build a deck play story mode relate to the elder scroll lore fight against other player duel in the arena compete in tournament fight with friend and lot of other feature it totally worth play it,pos
2831,after spend the majority of my afternoon play this game i can say it be really good if you enjoy the elder scroll series and be find of and tcg like harthstone magic the gathering or even the warcraft one this be for you it nail how a online trading card game should be the mechanic be balanced and fair plus this game be far more skill base over the dumb luck approach that some tcgs take cough cough hearthstone cough cough the card be easy to get through leveling and i quickly find my self with a surplus of option the game even give you some tough chocie early on the race you pick at the start even influence what card you will be get more of at the start the story be decent to nothing extreme but i find my self chuckle at a couple line and even care about one of the character that show up there be also checky nod and reffrence to the es series not go to spoil them though because some them be worth the reaction over all i think this be a very good and well make game and i look forward to play it more,pos
2832,the beginning be insanely frustrating there be a tutorial but it just cover the basic i think 3 tower and 4 bloon so you got to figure out th rest by yourself you can look up what the upgrade do and figure out what the tower itself do from there no idea where to look up what bloon do while play you be slowly get there but it be nothing for people with low patience as myself i guess you get throw into multiplayer with people who seem to know much more than you do and thus they win while you do not know what their tower be do or how to counter it i think you have to lose some match before you be able to win or jsut be extremely lucky if you like you can buy strong tower right away via microtransaction maybe you have well chance of win then the ui be a bit confusinng but i guess that be because it be for moblie i be slowly get the hang of it overall i can not say i enjoy the game but since it be so well receive i want to try and play some more currently i just can not recommend it since this have enough positive rating i do not feel bad about give it a negative now but i may change this later if i come to enjoy this,neg

2838,early access reviewthis game be amazing it be totally awesome the gameplay be sensational i really enjoy it the ui be a little clunky but okay i could deal with it it be a fantastic game however the in game currency system be a sham you have to pay for everything every single little thing you want to change about your character or even keep play you have to pay it be such a shameless method of the developer force you to keep play the game more what be bad if you choose a new career path after spend age get to rank 5 you have to pay to change this limit all your character option back to lv 1 again so you start from scratch again you also can not use certain weapon so what if you wanna swap back to the career you have already unlock you have to pay again i have waste 100 000 finding that out you only get about 7 000 per game i be constantly tax on every piece of this game i olve play it but this be well enough to force me to stop let us play the f ing game i do not mind pay for thing but it be far too expensive and they should stay unlocked unbelivable ruin a great game,neg

2841,i believe so far that be a noob in this game be quite cool all the geari have pick up actually work also when people be fight dungeon they do not descriminate by not help you the high level player do not look down on you but they do not pay attention to you eithier lol you can pretty much solo until the story take you to a dungeon of group boss fight then you have to wait for someone to show up and hope they be not low level as well lolso in this game i wuold say if you solo it be prepared to wait if you have get friend who play then you be golden,pos
2842,early access reviewwell i be sorry to say that the developer have manage to wreck what be one of my favorite game 1 the new battle mode be lame i be not interested in blast cube off of tower i want to engage enemy bot yes i know that be still part of the game but be should be the only part i think it would work much well to simply have zone control base on sole occupation of area similar to world of tank also have too many mode have cause crazy long que times what use to take 5 20 second to join a match now can take 15 minute 2 the developer have decide that component that be high tier should not be place on low tier bot this have essentially ruin all my bot design and make the game bot design and game play very cookie cutter it do not balance game play as much as it create identical build due to few option i will not be back to robocraft way to turn victory into fail,neg
2843,as many have say before me and it be necessary to repeat you really end up put money out to do much of anything once you add all of that money up it be beyond what you would pay for a retail release of a game that should be of high quality than this,neg
2844,so i see it be not enough for a review to say the game be good when it clearly be but i will ellaborate my thought so this game be my day to day grind simulator for when i just wanna chill and listen to some sweet music since i be not a big fan of diablo 3 and diablo have kinda outlive it be era and pass on to the forgotten but not forgotens hall of fame i be not compare this game to diablo in anyway and that s why i think it be good it be another game it have a lot of interesting very well make lore ton of spell attack and different way to defend yourself use all kind of gem that can freely be socket in and out of it be colour match socket in your armor or weapon the game have a certain difficulty it be not a beginner frendly game in itself it have a good introduction to wreaclast but it be the community that make that part great there s ton of guide and video on how to play the game i myself have watch the streamer and youtuber ziggyd to get a feeling for patch and new item the above have be almost only positive but path of exile have some downside and not just two but a bunch a few big to mention be the constant unsteadyness in the server you will never know when the server suddenly decide to spike out and there have be period where the lag have be almost character destroy but it seem to have get alot well it be repetetive like there be 4 act with different area and a ton of different map but it all boil down to run from one end to another killing all in your way with a little sidequesting and master mission the rng if you arnt use to not get your way or just have really bad luck and can not take it when you lose then this game be probably not for you since it be system think it be possible to find out what area to grind for certain item it be 50 chance a big part of the game be skill base but if do not get the item you need your not go to get far and almost everytime give up on the character to start a new and see if that go better or if some well item will drop ofcourse on counter to that there be a market for trade so if you get coin community get ware 7 10for be the good grinding game for list to music d love,pos
2845,early access reviewwhile its not perfect the core of the game be fun there be many thing go wrong but there be ton more thing do right one of the most important aspect of open world pvp be do right its fun and engage to fight in dispute zone this game be fun i have over 90 hour log so its already be worth it for me no matter what happen to it,pos

2851,get to say for a moba this game be quite nice could never really get into mobas until i play this do not have much time log in on this version yet but have put at least 9 day of playtime into the xbox one version it be a very addicting game and have well write lore on the different god character from the many different pantheon have very simple control and can be play with various gamepad controller that make them even simpler also the in game tutorial be very detailed and helpful for those who be new to the game another thing i like about this game be that although you can use microtransaction to purchase character skin vp etc you can also still earn the two different type of in game currency simply by play the game allow you to still purchase most of the forementioned thing above all in all it be a very fun and addictive game to play alone or with friend,pos
2852,early access reviewreally fun game and a unique addition to the battle royale genre highly recommend no this be not a fortnite clone about the only similarity be 1 it be a battle royale game which fortnite do not start 2 the art style which fit the general art style of hi rez games 3 you shoot people unfortunately due to be in alpha it have be off to a rocky start it be by no mean unplayable however a lot of the community seem to forget it be alpha and then stop play when something change that they do not agree with this show itself in the long queue time in the australian server atleast on the flip side hi rez choose to make it an open alpha so they need to be mindful of not burn their already fragile community with major gameplay change becuase they may never claw them back,pos
2853,can i say its more fun than some other tank game because it be very recommanded even for a free game at least i do not have to boot my window 10 pc to play the game now i can play it on window 7,pos
2854,when i first purchase this game i be think this be go to be some kind ofmemory game and well it be but it be so much more first off this be a memory game but not just any memory game it be a game about disassemble reassemble and even remember how each gun be take apart and put back together with without use the guide this game be really about remember the order in which you have to assemble the part there be also a shooting range for each gun so you get an idea on how to use the gun as well as teach you how to spare your ammo for each target and on how you can learn to use each gun on aim handle and even practice on move target one thing to note about this game be that although it be call world of gun it be not just about gun there be also section of the game that let you disassemble and reassemble skeleton army vehicle tank humvee sport car and even a harley during the course of play the game you also get some really neat info about each weapon vehicle and skeleton detail about the make model history concept and what go into make each weapon what i like most about this game be how well detailed the designer put into make each part of every weapon someone do some serious homework on this game base on how many part each gun have i find this game not only fun but also informative and even help me to learn to respect weapon learn how the mechanic and inside work be the good part about his game i have read some other review and they seem to claim that some part of the game be too hard although i can somewhat understand this be more of a memory game as each gun vehicle skeleton as an order in which it be assemble so you have to remember the order of the part in order to get a good score this be a memory game not so much a shooter game some gun have as much as 100 part to remember while a few gun only have say 20 30 part every part have it be place every part must also be do in a certain order so you got to use your head more than use your speed once you know how the part go speed will follow this be be a trial and error game as well as memory game if you like memory game this be a good game to get warn although this game be free you can purchase download content which open up all the area of the game or you can purchase experience point as well as credit to open up only a few select area you only start out with 1 gun at the beginning and must earn experience and credit to open up other area of the game you earn experience and credit when you complete task on each gun,pos
2855,the game be very balanced during staged battle no effect on the war however like in real war war mission be not usually balance you can buy whatever you want for the game because it will not affect it so it be not a pay2win game if you work as a group and build up a defensive or offensive strategy you will probably win it be not about money but teamwork i can highly and bravely recommend this game to everybody,pos
2856,this game have lead to alot of moment for me alot of them be hilarious whether that be me be a noob or not in the situation be a different story i still love play this game for the fact that there be still a ton of stuff i have yet to try some of my freind have ask me advice and to be quite honest even with 1000 hour i still feel like a major noob the big thing i mention be try out the silly thing you can think of get rid of tradtional thought about character steriotype be important i feel i also love how with 1000 hour the craft system atleast for me have be always a touch out of my reach for the challange leagues i mean would deffinetly reccomend to arpg fan update the game be head in a new direction currently mechanic be get rework new system be get implement and they be do away with replay the game 3 time over and add one single playthrough i still reccomend the game just think i would post an update that change seem to be on the way for well or bad,pos

2860,early access reviewjust go to throw this out there first off some review be actually corret after read about a page or two of review i decide to try it regardless think it may be a knock off battlefield 1942 and it kind of be in some sense it be fun at first until you reach rank 3 and then it all change it turn into a completely pay 2 win game you do not stand a chance if you do not own tank plane pilot tank crew man along with anti tank vehicle weapon maybe it be just me try to stay loyal and play with only my us troop when germany be clearly stack and get a lot more benefit in the war such as two spawn point more life and their gun seem slightly well in general all in all i give this game a 2 5 it have have a lot of potential but as most f2p fps game it fall on p2w in the end or really in the near start so enjoy your rank 0 3 trial then do not bother unless you have get money to throw away,neg
2861,first off i have a fear of the paranormal so this kind of game be effectively my bad enemy that be why i decide to start off with spookys house of jump scare it be a seemingly cute and cuddly parody of modern horror game where you travel around a massive mansion full of terrifying monster for the first few minute you wonder why you though of get it for the next few hour you be run for your life from the freaky thing ever think cardboard cutout be not scary just wait,pos
2862,early access reviewyou crave for smash brawl kinda game but you only own pc rest assure since there be an alternative for that and it be call brawlhalla folk it be still in early access but heck you could get a lot of fun from this and it be free too so on to the review not pay 2 win you could unlock all character by just play a lot what be cash for then vanity item makesyou a lot cool but do not affect the gameplay at all and the default character do not worry since there be a lot to choose from and they be not weak compare to the pay character at all a lot of legendarie it be the term for the character in this game yeah there be a lot of character and each one have their own unique playstyle require timing and skill it be not just your ordinary button spamming game folk timing be require here so it could be count as competitive fighting game the bgm sound really catchy and fit the game and again it be free folk so that be it now for the people who crave to brawl what be you wait for try it asap,pos

2865,i really love this game untill it go down the sh er lemme explain so throughout the entire time i have play this game which be long than i have on my steam acount russian plane be and still be know as the most op s t ever well cmon the dev can change it if you present historical evidence well it have be do and you know what the dev say it be just anti russian propoganda it seem like gaijin be stick with this whole nationalism thing even into a game now let talk about the community it seem like gaijin do not even f ing know it exist i mean cmon if you promise something at least make something for example gaijin promise bomber interior for a long time pass a couple year later we have new airplane new tank new map and everything but f cke what they promise i have long stop play this game for myself i only sometimes boot it up to play with my friend but other than that i be really do with this game i would not recommend this game to anybody that want historical accurracy or fair matchmaking or anybody who like to communicate with the dev,neg
2866,i like this game and after read the review i have to disagree with many of them about have to already be a fan of gun i see many potential way to have fun in the game and in the end even if you do not have any fun assemble disassembling and operate the gun the game have to offer there be other model in the game include skeleton car and motorcycle really there be quite a bit of fun to be have if you go into the game look at it like a puzzle sim game and you may even learn something about the way gun operate and how they be manufacture and or assemble if that be the sort of thing for you you should also know there be statistic and info for each gun available if you want to know more information about whatever one you be interested in not all aspect of the game be enjoyable at least for me after a point you will hit grind unless you pay and grind be the polar opposite of fun most if not all of the time there be also a requirement for some content to invite friend to the game now i know that it may not sound bad to need to invite friend to play the game but if your like me and most of your steam friend do not play these type of game you will run into an issue fairly quickly even if your friend will play you do not want to end up look like a spamming jerk do you in the end i think you should just download the game yourself ts pretty small so it should not take long and try it after all only you can tell if you like it,pos

2870,early access reviewa winter battle royale worth tryingby no mean be ring of elysium a perfect game but it be a unique take on the br genre with the wonderful price of free the badi would say the bad part about the game be the sound design hardly anything sound like it be suppose to or sound cheap but really mechanically the game be great and the graphic be decent enough the goodthe style of the game be excellent i love the winter ski resort theme and the ability fly board or zipline my way around the map vehicle and basic loot be plentiful but the ymir storm be ruthless and only give you about a minute before you start lose your toe gunplay be solid and i look forward to what they will add to the game overall a great experience i highly recommend grab a few of your friend and give it a try,pos
2871,start play story mode all the way up to the final level chapter 20 and after six fail attempt be never able to beat it i spend well over an hour in total after my first loss building and rebuilding deck to try to find a combination that would allow me to finally complete story mode to no avail video of other who have beat it either a get lucky or b use more powerful card than i have receive possibly purchase i e pay to win find no acceptable solution to break through the wall that be the tutorial for this game i be out boring game not worth the time,neg

2875,early access reviewi pay about 100 usd and climb to gold rank in two week with the win rate of 70 or so but decide to quit because the game play be not fun pro it be fun to brew your own deck if you be rich enough to build sufficient card collection the card that utilize the void use spell and dead creature pool and those that manipulate the deck like warcry give 1 1 to the next card you draw create a significantly great space for deck variety con the playing itself be very dull and rng heavy and frustrating if you do not draw the right combination of power mana in the first few turn you can not play any card and just watch your opponent beat you up if both player manage to draw the right power then the match be decide base on who get to draw more threat and answer if the opponent play tavrod for 2 turn and you only have 1 removal you lose if the opponent be aggro and you do not have lightning storm aoe removal by turn 3 you lose if the opponent be chalice a weapon that buff small creature and draw you card and you can not burn him in the first few turn you lose if your deck be base on reanimate the void and the opponent just happen to play a steward of the past which retroactively silence everything in your void on top of have a good stat on its own you lose at the mulligan phase you have absolutely no information on what kind of deck the opponent be play so you just blindly mulligan for power in hearthstone you know the opponent class so you can make an educated guess as to what card will be effective in eternal you never know if you should keep the lightning storm match be very snow bally one sided and rng i feel whatever i do or the opponent do have no bearing on the outcome you can try and play for free but be warn when you have enough card to build an optimize deck when your threat demand answer and you can include as many hard removal as the meta call then the game have become a dice roll i will come back only if they change the power system,neg

2890,this may be the only time to actually waste money on this game consider the 70 off otherwise the amount of money spend on this game just to collect car and track be ridiculous for what you end up with compare to their old title and hate to through in console but fm and gt game then not to mention the upcoming project car which i be part of and be in my opinion stunning and love the the work those guy be put into their new game project car,neg
2891,two year ago i would have recommend this game now i can not i do not have experience with other flight simulator if you can call war thunder a simulator so i can not say whether the game be realistic and use accurate flight model or not but i can tell you that the game at it be current state be mostly not fun to play and the developer seem to try to make the game more unfun with each update there be two main reason for this the grind and the un balance in order to research a new plane you have to invest a certain amount of research point towards it which you earn by play match when you finish research the plane you can buy it with ingame currency buy the plane be not actually an issue as you always have enough money do not sound too bad until you see the number at the start of the game it be not too bad a low tier plane cost around 9000 rp research point or less and you can earn at least 1000 per match if you do well that be 9 game fair enough the problem be that rp requirement for plane get exponentially big and big while the game only let you earn about the same amount each game to get a tier 4 plane the game have 5 tier the fw 190 d9 for example you will need 89 000 rp while you be only able to earn 1200 rp on average that be about 75 game for one plane and each game take about 20 minute that mean you need to grind for 25 hour for 1 plane want to get a jet play 500 match the game do not reward you for play well either even if you eliminate several player every match and even if you be the mvp the game will only give you a pitiful 2000 3000 rp at most it be a little well but the difference be almost not noticeable on top of that gaijin the dev keep add more filler plane to the game that no one ask for those plane be virtually identical version of plane already ingame and i can think of no reason to add them other than as a way to slow the grind even further they could have at least make research them optional but in order to advance in the tech tree you have to research say plane this mean that you will find yourself finally research a plane after many hour only to find it be the same as and maybe even a bad version of the previous plane so to get to the plane you want double at least the amount of time i mention earlier because you have to chew through a bunch of useless plane first gaijin could not care less about this issue and have in fact reduce the amount of rp earn significantly over the year rp gain have be reduce over time by approximately 99 not even kid since i start play this be also why i have such a large number of hour play on this game because have it be this way since the beginning i would have quit very quickly this make progress the game a painful experience and it be why i quit play it now the second issue balance this one be a less issue to me because i do not play game for historical matchup the game use a system call battle rating to match different plane together in a battle a plane battle rating be suppose to reflect its ability over its opposition a combination of the plane armament speed and such thing plane with a similar battle rating will be match together the problem be that the battle rating system make no sense and simply do not work you will see plane from 1943 face plane from 1941 and plane from 1941 face plane from even 1937 plane that be rarely fly in real life be use en masse in the game against plane that never see them in combat and be perhaps obsolete by that time keep in mind that world war 2 last 6 year and so a 2 year difference be huge also keep in mind that most of the plane that fight aircraft old than them in the game actually match their opposition well enough in real life the result be that a large majority of the plane ingame be borderline useless because at the same battle rating there be more effective plane and they be outperform by their opposition which probably never fight them in real life some plane be mediocre and some be blatantly overpowered at their battle rating if i feel like seal clubbing i can just take out my he 112 a0 f2a buffalo or almost any spitfire of choice there be more option and easily get up to 10 kill per match in realistic battle because my opposition simply stand no chance in their plane of course i would get next to no reward for this but i sure would make a lot of people frustrate in the case of the he 112 a0 the game think this plane should be match against biplane which simply stand no chance against a pilot who know what he be do on the other hand the entire heavy fighter and bomber line in all nation be nearly completely useless bomber and heavy fighter be free kill to any pilot who know his stuff in realistic battle a tiny amount of exception do exist some fighter be completely helpless against their enemy while some even a monkey can use and be an ace similar problem occur throughout the entire tech tree of all 5 nation so why do these matchup exist that you can ask only gaijin which if ask would delete your post and tell you there be no such thing as balance issue in war thunder this bring me to the final part of this review the developer any of the above will likely never be fix the developer only feedback about the game come through the forum they do not read the english forum and it be up to the community management team to take care of the user input the way the forum be manage by those moderator honestly give off a cold war communist regime vibe anything that may be percieve as disagreement with the way gaijin do certain thing or as a complaint about a major issue in the game be deal with in a similar way the post delete the poster maybe ban and if enough people complain about the issue that gaijin have to address it they will claim it simply do not exist there be many more problem with the game that i have not mention because i have not experience them personally simulator bomber abuse no such thing accord to gaijin despite plenty of video evidence the balance of jet era fighter the ground force aspect of the game in general i be not sure if the developer themselves do not care about the quality of the game or if the community manager simply do not pass over the feedback either way the developer think the game be fine as it be and keep release more filler plane more ridiculous battle rating change that make no sense almost as if their goal be to take what fun be leave away from the game everything work perfectly well in gaijin land comrade except it do not tl dr if you have a lifetime to spend grind and you do not mind the terrible dev and balance issue play this game it be free after all but it be a waste of your time,neg

2902,early access reviewup until about a week ago this game be great the economy change single handedly ruin it however there be no need for me to re hash it here since the other thousand of negative review will do a far well job of that but it suck to play out a 15 minute game and earn next to nothing regardless of your performance in the battle you will have to grind literally about 100 15 minute game to earn a single high end module which you will need to do several time in order to build one decent high end robot this game be absolutely not worth your time,neg

2908,well it be fun for 90 hour but then it dawn upon me to truly master the game you have to pick a skill and make a perfect path for it and perfect gear and both of those take forever and a day,pos
2909,due to the immense amount of positive review for this game few will read this and even few will listen however i simply can not reccomend a game that run at 18 25 frame on damn near the low setting while anything truly important be go on especially when the spec of my computer 12 gb ram fx 8350 gtx 750 ti clearly be superior to the reccomended system requirement of the game there be time where i get framerate closer to 40 60 however these time be few and far between and only take place in desolate area without player vehicle or even the simple structure i have other complaint about this game although i be sure other negative review already cover them so i will leave it to fellow dissapointed player to voice their opinion on the matter i be sadden by my experience with the game especially due to how fun it seem it would be if it be to run properly at least it be free,neg
2910,early access reviewi do not know how i get into this game to be honest i can not even remember go in all i can remember be my character wake up on the second floor of an abandon house just outside the town where i live and that i be wear some soldier clothe the name of the soldier be karl muller i know this because i could read the name tag on the jacket all this seem very weird to me but i decide to just go back home and figure out everything there i need to get out of those clothe i do not want to be confused with someone else just as i be walk down i hear someones whistle and an engine run outside the house when i step outside i see a man wear some weird look green uniform run towards a funny look green small vehicle and leave i decide to steal a bicycle that be sit right in front of the house and go for a ride through the field i figure it be the short way home as i be make my way along the river i hear a loud noise in the wood and then a clicking noise metal on metal right afterwards i get off the bike and take protection behind a tall tree and all i remember be that i be very scared i take a minute to look around and see where that noise be come from then i see it it be that man wear the green uniform he be lie on the floor have a really long rifle and he be look down to a wooden barn across the field it be a long way but i see some man run in and out of that barn they be wear a dark grey uniform much like the one i be wear and look desperate it be almost as if they be run for their life then the man shoot another bullet with his rifle it be so loud that i have to cover my ear then i look towards the barn and see one of those soldier lie on the floor motionless the other soldier be nowhere to be find and i remember feel sorry for that guy i ask myself why do this happen why that sadness i feel for the guy quickly turn into anger but to myself i feel rage and resentment to my cowardly action this anger take control over myself and make me grab a shovel i have in my procession do not know where it come from and smash it into that mans head there be nothing he could do i think it take one or two hit but by the time i be do he be no long part of this world i grab his rifle and see a complete different world through that scope i see tank and loud fighter airplane i see man in dark gray and green uniform run everywhere i see them fight over abandon house bridge and other sector i see dead body fly several hundred meter up in the air i see a man on a motor bike run over three young soldier and then explode after hit a tree i see smoke and hear loud explosion all the thing i see i see them through the scope of this rifle a rifle i do not pay for then i quickly realize that i be a real soldier and that i be send to this free to play war to see all this epic thing and to recommend this game to you there be a free to play soldier in all of us 10 10 would steal your scope car bike and tank from you again,pos
2911,this be a game that look good by this page but have an overwhelming amount of microtransaction and a really unwelcoming community where you need to be a pay member to create a multiplayer map and you be able to password lock game but many do not and will just kick you after you spend five minute load in,neg
2912,decent game that can be fun at time and be a good way to kill some time stay interesting as the game be frequently update and their be many possible build along with many skill point though most of them be passive be very good and allow many playthrough of the game very similar to diablo 2 and 3 can rival both of them which be amazing and suprising due to path of exile be a free to play i recommend this game and think it be good apart from sometimes it can be boring and dull as some of the level can get confusing and feel like a massive maze this can add to the game at time aswell though but some of the game other feature make up for this,pos
2913,do you like action rpg like diablo 2 torchlight and titan quest yes then look no futher than path of exile this game be free to play in every sense of the word all money you can potentially spend be on cosmetic and stash if you want more or a dedicated currency stash tab that hold much big stack if you like it it be worth support them as they have make an enjoyable game that never hound you to spend money one playthrough will take around 20 25 hour to get through the original 3 act but they have add up to chapter 10 now so who know how long it take now the big difference with this game as oppose to other action rpgs be that the skill you have be tie to gem that you pick up and then slot into armor weapon these gem level up by you use them you can unslot them and then reslot other gem as you see fit they maintain their level this allow you to really experiment with build while not be restrict to specific skill or armor just give it a go you will like it personal progress record 67 hour ranger level 50 act 5maurdaer level 9scion level 6templar level 20shadow level 16duelyst level 1witch 37 hardcore mode character ranger level 1 pvp character,pos

2916,immediatly fun because space ship hide depth and strat abound the grind feel like alot at first but you quickly get ship and crew that you enjoy each ship feel very different the crew you choose can add alot of personality to your ship as well with sometimes badass other time funny commentary and live combat response it do not just feel like drive an empty lifeless ship through empty lifeless space combat be mostly slow and methodical with burst of of intense heavy firing action when both team be on point the battle be extremely rewarding its a game where position be everything predict enemy movement while also try to win rock paper scissor while at the same time you can be on the lose end of a type matchup and still come out on top with superior piloting and alot of heart the dev seem to not only love play there game but be rather active with update which be a mega plus,pos
2917,early access reviewfun game well opimize and come with free spyware installation that you do not agree to instal that you have to spend half of your day remove from your computer also feature an involuntary peer to peer update system that without your permission or knowledge use your bandwith to seed to other peer computer welcome to the botnet,neg
2918,i watch the ad look cool the part they miss out be the 10 hour of walking and the part where it go whoops you need to pay to shoot that rock nonono you need a licence to climb that what be you do you need a licence to shoot that bug well i end up shoot myself and i need a licence for that 0 10 just do not get this stupid game,neg

2920,world okay moba edit i quit the game and uninstalle beware the community be cancer bad most of the time you will be fight your teammate in the chat rather than enemy god on the field mute everyone and you will be fine,pos
2921,the game it be good and dev too and here be why very fun to play at start so satisfying when you get kill if you finish like first five mission u get 1000 gold that be pretty decent variety of tank the only con for me the game get a little bit bored after you get a few of good tank,pos
2922,not really design for casual gamer but can still be fun on the normal server if you want the most out of the game do ample preparation look up build or use the provide skill tree on the website to make your own it seem intimidating at first but honestly it be so worth it the sheer possibility of build this game provide be incredible you pay money only for cosmetic so there be absolutely no pay to win aspect in poe have not try the pvp because the pve be so engaging but i will do it sometime my hour be not reflect on steam i start way before i download this on steam i have play 5 hc character to their death and a couple normal character before that 10 10,pos
2923,only one campaign once its do you have to buy the first part of a new campaign for 1000 coin which be hard to get or cave in and waste your money you also have to use coin or waste money to play the arena and pvp arena pay to win,neg
2924,early access reviewokay listen up this game it be a whirlwind i play it a while ago and can tell you it be pretty fun now that do not mean i would have recommend this game over counter strike even for the free price tag but it be fun broken and fun after an mmmmm 5 month hiatus i have come back to it and no surprise whatsoever it get bad before i get into that i be go to tell you what they have go for them break spawn trap unbeleiveabley unbalanced gun small and crowded map and sub par server okay graphic like ps2 now they try to fix that spawn protection the gun have be balance on the edge of a cliff with everything on one side new map server that no longer tell you your ping now you be leave wonder if that knife death be because you be lag or because the game decide that a ten foot knife be now in the game graphic that make my computer couch and weeze when i try to load it in 720p early ps1the game when i get it be a mixture of cs go and c o d and it be break beyond belief but it be fun you could go 80 0 with your friend and not care about anything it may be early access but i do not think that go backwards be how you make a game i know that i be rambe but i guess this could be gear more towards the maker of the game if you see this go back a few month figure out what you want with this game and build from there for those of you that feel like get this game before cs go do not get csgo first and then ty this game out drop a thirty bomb in casual or tdm then get the game,neg
2925,early access reviewreally amazing game i buy it a few day ago and i be hook the game run very smooth and the gameplay be quite fun and engage in addition at least playing in pubbie lobby ship seem to be fairly balanced and it feel like every ship play quite different from the other this game play a lot like world of tank or world of warship but with spaceship and with a 3d range of movement however it also have moba esque quality of have multiple lane and have to push defensive structure to kill your enemys main base what make this very enjoyable be the fact that you have to position shoot and maneuver your ship on a micro level to defeat your enemy but you also have to make sure that your overall map positioning and timing be good on a team level as well i e make sure your team arrive at gamma together and on time make sure you be defend base when the enemy have access etc it can be a little daunting at first but the learning curve be not too steep especially if you have play mobas and understand positioning timing etc tldr great game play like a mixture of world of tank warship combine with a moba esque style,pos
2926,yay for ruin this awesome game way to go you guy go to lose player one by one after spend a few awesome hour play and enjoy this game it be ruin by the new patch greedyhead i do not belive you will make more money if you lose a bunch of player i do not recomment this game for any newcomer,neg
2927,if you love build and craft you should definitely give this game a try i love the community aspect and the adventure that you can explore and or build be lovely you can have a world all to yourself or share it with other you can create blueprint of your build to share with other it never cease to amaze me how ingeniously people use the block to create incredible build the seasonal event be fun too and good of all the dev be still work on the game so new stuff be come out several time a year all in all a lovely game to express your creativity,pos
2928,its a good game i have be play for 2 year almost and damn i be glad i play this game when i do i make sooooooooo many ing friend have ton of fun but it have its down side pvp be a mess tbh ton of people be bad sport dungeon be just too long at point and it feel like pay to win at time alot of people be jerk and ya but there be always the good people in this game which really tbh be not many i be lucky to find them and if you do find them game get alot well but this game have some boring part too grind get really boring at time and event be long and boring at time u get to work uroff to get the event item which sometimes be not worth it but in all and all i have fun and that s what matter so yeah if you ever need someone to play elsword with just gimme a call and ill join ya if i get the time xd,pos
2929,this be one of the most rage induce game i have ever play but somehow i still get drag back into play it example you will grind for like 4 8 and then have good tiered stuff and your mind be like ahhh finally i have make a charcter that will live forevr and then pretty much after you start get those thought just get off because your gunna e die the next second the moment after die be the bad becasue your either super salty or in rage mode because of decas server in a duegeon lag and can not close realm and then 5 second later the server be abck and then ohh your dude that you spend hour on be just e dead not even because of you its casue of deca this game be so weird when you get mad you get offand your basically be call the game trash but somehow you contiounsly get drag back in this game this game be highly addicting one you start to grasp how to play i would recommend get start everything be pretty much pay to win because you have to buy a good pet you have to my space in your vault you have to buy everything and sadly i have spend money and i regret it because it just make me want to play more so i can get my ing money worth would not recommend,neg
2930,okay let me start by say a couple of thing one yes i absolutely recommend this game two yes the payment model be an absolute mess and some thing that be pay be just silly however under say payment model there be also a lot misconception mostly concern license and ammo due to a lack of explanation on the dev end and also youtuber do review on game that they have play for 8 minute and 7 second allow me to break it all down for you the payment model and membership let me just start by say that i be not here to defend this business model because it be atrocious and be not my favorite by a long shot i know there be a lot of player that will not try this game because of half cocked review and lack of explanation expansive world this be also your fault do not charge for trophy shot pose cmon okay okay the store ugh yes every weapon pretty much be pay heres the thing you do not need every weapon out of the gate that be just silly so the way it work be hunterscore hunterscore be a base on a total point count that come from reach various milestone your first kill be your first milestone per weapon and per specie from there you be give point to your score for 25 50 100 250 500 and 1000 kill yes every weapon apart from a few exclusive that do not contribute to the score require 1000 kill to achieve the maximum hunter score so day one you want to try the game out and feel overwhelmed by the amount of weapon for sale that be normal even the start 243 require 1000 kill start with it it take a long time to get that 1000 kill max it and get another weapon every 2 3 week or buy everything in the game at once and send your wife into a coma like i do let me explain why that be pointless i own all the thing cool except it be not i now have 18 52 11 rifle that have 1 30 kill each and the chance that i will reach 1000 with them be now so low that my brother can not even walk under them he be short point get a weapon or two and go with them for the first while okay b00 m i buy a weapon but there be no way i be go to keep buy ammo for it when it run out that be where the membership come in it be 9 99 for 3 month it be not that bad what make it bad be all of the other stuff in unison clothing weapon scent eliminator with that membership your ammo will not run out each rifle pistol and bow come with 30 round or arrow 150 for the 22 and 17 birdshot for a shotgun come with 90 those number be per hunt once they be go they be only go for that hunt start up another and you will see it right back in your lodge but it be not enough ammo for a hunt yes yes it be stop shoot hole in the cloud and try to saw down tree with arrow it be not help if you be send 30 round through a 243 in 15 minute then you be do it wrong if you shoot that bad at a walking target you should be spend your time at the range and not in the field cool i be not buy a license for each animal either no well neither be i because that be stupid on 318 level if you buy one for an animal then i be not call you stupid thaw out snowflake and keep read that same membership take care of that as well if you want to play one hunt a month and have a life outside of game then the individual license may be more practical for you long term player should not be touch those silly thing as far as clothing and all the other stuff go listen up a lot of that be preference not all the outfit matter as each one have certain effect on certain animal it be not that drastic yes you will blend better with the appropriate camo but it will not be game break to play without it until you decide to get it i also buy all the clothing she be still hot that 400 hell tent stand and thing like that be quality of life if you want them buy them if not the game will not force close and take you to the store with it be hand out on a side note tent serve as spawn point and with the reserve be quite large i recommend a couple but that be entirely up to you i have probably skip out on 100 rare jump around the reserve walk from place to place be never a bad idea anyway caller caller be one of the more reasonably price item in the game compare to the other stuff but can still get a little expensive if all be buy at once nickel and dime from week to week or month to month and it be not bad also look at the caller bundle duck goose blind lol stay away from duck and goose until you be sure you want to stay for the long haul because a fowl setup be outright dumb as far as payment a blind and decoy spread can run you nearly 30 people that have travel across the country with 3 of their ex in the car have spend less money than us fowl hunter in this game ems and gms ems be pay and gms be earn and also a little on the useless side gms be great for thing like scent and scent eliminator but that be about the extent of it there be a few other thing which you can browse the store to see ems can also be earn by place in competition and from the uhc website where there be player make competiton and payout much high payout okay so i be interested in it now be it fun absolutely the sound visual and scope of the game be second to none as far as hunting game each animal be unique with it be very own score card that break down detail to level that i do not even bother read haha the reserve be large and the optional content be through the roof if not terribly overpriced play with friend join competion em payout and do missons gm payout listen if you read the review then i appreciate you take the time to do so if you still feel like it be too expensive to play then i totally understand that if you want to stick around and play then tinker with the free content before get a membership just remember that without a membership this game be lack and it be almost a requirement if you have any question or would like to be show the rope then i will always help a new player message me on steam and i will get you into my discord and get you go grab yourself a membership after some time and a weapon or two you will get out pretty cheap and still have a great experience until the next time you need to buy a thing expanisive world try to help me make this clear with a big red banner that say you be go to want a membership to enjoy this game the vid be mislead and it be hardly free to play you be kill your own review,pos
2931,so i spend some time in the tutorial figure out the control then load up the dogfight mission 1 su 25 vs 2 a 10s sound like fun attempt the first i fire both aphid head on both track for flare we pass each other and start to turn and it be at this point that the ace combat reflex that loom threateningly in the dark corner of my mind whenever i boot up a flight sim decide to pounce i forget that i be fly an su 25 not an su 37 and attempt to execute a j turn it go poorly for detail on exactly how poorly it go see the verse about the passenger liner from the song albuquerque by weird al yankovick attempt the second i fail to achieve missile lock during the first pass and circle around we mauever for a while i manage to tag one of the warthog with my first archer and kill it with the second i manage to get behind the second warthog and fire both aphid both go for his flare i close to gun range and we enter the horizontal scissor i take a snapshot and miss just before i overshoot i hear him fire his gun and dive to try and evade several second later i notice two rather peculiar and alarming thing a my plane have decide that it want to be upside down now and will not take no for an answer and b i can not pull out of the dive approximately 3 72 second before i make an impressively large mess in some poor bastard wheat field i look behind me and notice that roughly two third of my plane have mysteriously vanish 10 10 would fail to notice get light up with a gau 8 all over again,pos
2932,short review smite be a good moba for anyone who want to try one and for experienced player alike long review smite be a moba that be somewhat different from other it have a third person perspective that i personally like there be a wide range of character to choose from 70 at the time of this review along with the wide range of character be 6 different game mode there be 5 different character type to choose assassian which stick and move secure a kill warrior who be constantly in the fight hunter long range specialist for ranged attack mage who deal a variety of magical attack and lastly there be guardian who play support but can also deal a lot of damage the 6 different game mode differ quite a bit there be arena which be just a 5v5 deathmatch where your team try to kill the other and escort minion into the enemy portal reduce the enemy score to 0 win this game joust be a 3 on 3 mode that use teamwork to advance to your enemy titan to destroy it to win of course you must get through the enemy team tower and phoenix this be a one lane mode with buff for each team to pick up on either side assault be 5v5 one lane fight where you be randomly give a god and you and your team work your way to the enemy titan to destroy it similar to joust but you can not go back and buy equipment or item until you be dead seige be a 4v4 2 lane fight to destroy the oppose enemy titan this be more strategic than the other mode teamwork be almost always nescessary here conquest be the main game mode of smite it be a 5v5 3 lane strategy game the goal be to destroy the enemy team titan once again but teamwork and play your role be a nescessity in this mode conquest rely heavily on strategy overall smite be a fun game for me and i personally do not play many mobas there be a few minor issue i have some god play too similar the community can be toxic at time and the server can get overload at time as well but those be my big gripe i do recommend this game to anyone want to try a moba,pos
2933,i would not call this a minecraft clone but more like a minecraft inspire game the animation be smooth i can run it on my crap pc with low detail and it still look nice the only issue i see be with a low resolution the gauntlet clip off the screen and the pay to win here be unreal if you want to see pay 20 buck and get a flashlight want to run longer pay 20 buck to double stamina want to fly pay 20 buck to get a glider want to have more than 1 world pay 20 buck do not make it free if you have to pay for all the feature,neg

2936,early access reviewif you think hearthstone be way too simple then this be the good digital card game on the market compare to other game it also feel like it have a very generous f2p model where you can build up to tier 1 deck at a reasonable pace while some deck be undoubtedly well than other there be a plethora of viable deck build around many different interesting card so there should be something for everyone unless you expect pure jank to be t1 then you be probably out of luck you will win game even with janky combo though if you be willing to work for it,pos

2939,early access reviewfirst off this game be far well than pubg and fortnite in my personal opinion i find it take everything wrong that be with pubg and just fix it and i find its well than fortnite cause honestly fortnite be just a prime example of a company sell out refer to epic kill paragon for fortnite and then release 12mil of asset for free on unreal just to say hey we be do with this we care more about money than our work so you all can finish the game but this review be not about those two game its about this one first impression be superb i really enjoy the character customization menu and the variety of clothing option you can preview beforehand now when i play on the beta it be not a snow map so this make me think they will be add seasonal map with a variety of pack to go with them now the big thing of this game be the pack system which i will give a pro and con of gliderpros good mobility pack ingame in term of move speed you can literally glide across the map the glock be nicecon i find you need to start in the mountain for this pack to shine as its limited to where you can use it low capacity start off so need to focus on find a backpack for max carry snowboardpros can be use almost anywhere uphill and downhill can cover great downhill distance medium mobility and medium capacity can do gnarly jumpscon you be limit to certain path it kind of contrict the pro i have mention but its a little hard to explain you would have to see for yourself rock climbing kit my personal fav pro can use ice axis to quickly skim up and down slope max start capacity the shotgun be decent zipline be motor drive so can be use up and down can jump off early at your own risk if you see incoming threat can cover long distance fastcon i find the rock climbing itself be very linear and there be not as many rock path as zipline zip post can be easily camp now that s out of the way i want to give more insight on the game it have hit marker it have bullet drop i find the gun be balance except for the fact that hip firing be so useless i would not recommend it the way you all spawn in the map be different than the traditional bus plane the map be divide by what i can roughly estimate a 30x30 grid its a guestimate i have not actually count and player can choose which square they want to go it light up to signify its take so can choose to fight right off the bat or do not the loot be not scarce at all you will always find something somewhere the 3 gun you can have i find be a little overkill but i be not complain all and all for an early access game and for me to pump out this much information in the 3 odd hour i play be just very entertaining this be my first review of any game please feel free to share your thought why you agree or disagree with the point i have make p s to the dev please look into the idea of make rock climbing kit a permanent thing it be so useful and i find it should be essential but so far love the game can not wait to see what s in store and potential console port cheer,pos

2950,early access review do not waste your time on this game dev be terrible by balance the game they remove the only way to get money easily make you pay for color and add lock on missile and uzi gun and anti air cannon they also remove the ability to fire all of one type of gun cause you to spam the numberkey to fire like a freaking moba which they add moba mode be a game mode where you capture tower and destroy their base if give good money but the game be 10 30 min all the weapon cost around 200 000rp one 30 minute match get you around 90 000 if you lose most of the time cause you to grind for hour upon hour to get a good bot it be not always this way the game use to be super fair fun and the people on it do not steal each other work sorry rosefall but i see your bot way too much the megabots update be incredible it add a new challenge a way to get massive amount of money and once you get there it be a last after see how happy people be the demon at freejam then decide to remove them as it be make tdm unbalanced now all you see be missile carrier with lock on crap and practicly invinsible bot that only focus on shield and spamme the new uzi gun if freejam really want their fan and supporter back they will actually makde the game balance remove the lock on gun add back a way for steady income and make sure their update will not upset 70 of the people play this game,neg
2951,early access reviewfirst off i have to say this be the good freaking brawler for pc i have play i honesly think i like it better then smash net code seem pretty solid i personaly have not experience much in the form of lag the control be tight and i have not notice balance issue bare new ledgend when they bring them in but that get flush out the only downside to this be the game buisness model i get into it with the all ledgend pack with that pack the micro transaction be all cosmetic but honestly i would be more than willing to drop the money for a full release cost on this and not have them in the game at all the skin be cool look but frankly just not worth it at the current cost i do not say this to rag on the game i say this because i love the game and i think it would be so much well as a traditional game or at least a skin pack,pos
2952,early access reviewpros it be aq freaking 3d it be not too laggynot p2w yet con not a lot of class compare to aqw long level up timeweird camera angle my preference overall 8 10 would play more when they add class and more way to get exp fast,pos
2953,even nearly 5 year after its release it be still one of the good game out there and be still very much alive with many large 100 people battle regardless of several people say that it be die or dead because that will not happen for a very long time it be free to play and be not pay to win you can easily defeat those with superior equipment if you know how to do so fun infantry combat with a variety of class which all have their own use and importance on the battlefield a variety of vehicle and air asset with customisable weaponry equipment and ability to fit role that you desire such as aa tank or ammo resupply sunderer each faction have some unique vehicle and weapon specific to them which be more of less balanced you have the ability to make your own basis though this be something the map or continent be huge basis vary in importance and have lattice link so there be a sense of progression when take them and involve strategic think any minor event such as sneak around your enemy on foot and destroy a sunderer can have a significant impact of the battle for the entire continent which can give exhilarating feeling there be many organised outfit and platoon on every server with every faction that be friendly and willing to take on new player but also there be the freedom to play solo play how you wish to if you be willing to pay for them there be a wide range of cosmetic that give you the ability to stand out out of the 800 hour i have play this 200 hour before realize it be on steam i have only ever encounter 1 hacker who be in a fly max which be in 2014 they have implement an anti cheat software to mostly prevent this further so hacker be rampant not a chance update be few but do happen do not help that daybreak be not exactly an extremely wealthy game company so they be limit in their ability to do massive overhaul on a frequent basis bug and glitch occasionally occur such as touch a vehicle wreck with your own vehicle cause yours to explode and get out of a vehicle in an awkward place such as a very narrow gorge can make you fall through the map sometimes people on your own faction grief and tk or have an overwhelming desire to get a pointless revenge such as accidently run someone over in a vehicle or kick them out of your vehicle then a minute later they c4 fire rocket at or throw tank mine at you especially annoying when you be in the process of deploy a sunderer somewhere or be advance with a mbt which waste nanite for a vehicle heavy person like me traitor like these be more of an important issue than hacker imo,pos
2954,card game be for sure my favorite digital collectible trading card game ccg tcg it be super free to play friendly and you consistently get free pack card over time even in the beginning you do not feel like you be completely outmatched just because someone have rarer card in their deck than you you can play budget deck see and still win with a good strategy it be a bit close to magic the gathering mtg than simple card game like hearthstone and shadowverse in that you still draw power card rather than gain power evenly each turn but there be a lot more mechanic compare to mtg that reduce how often you draw too little or too much power it be also more like mtg in that it be more complex than the other digital ccg option out there one major benefit over mtg be that this be strictly a digital game so you have fun mechanic that would be very hard to pull off for mtg since that still have to cater to a physical card game for example stat on kill unit remain even if the card return from the void just recently dec 2018 a new set of card have come out that have really add to the deck building option it feel like the popular deck be always change and you have many different option with the type of game you can play and that one type of deck be not always the winner you be definitely reward for playing against other player but especially in the beginning and after a new set be release play against the ai be fun and give you a lot of card the reason be that when you draft card unlike other game they be permanently add to your deck how cool be that definitely try it it be free to play and you never feel pressured to put money into the game you can play on ios android steam xbox and they be always keep in sync and all reward be available on all platform achievement sync too except xbox pvp play be cross platform note that you get a free preconstructe deck by use a referral code to sign up i do not want to post my code but feel free to message me for it if you find my review helpful i would appreciate it that say do not feel bad if you do not get the deck you can get all those card fairly quickly even if you do not use a referral link the game do make you play the first six or so game of the tutorial but after that you can skip the tutorial from the setting menu if you do not want to complete it also check out reddit for a really cool community and more information there be also a couple link there to free promotion that get a free campaign you can also get other campaign by spend in game currency that you gain just by play as i say you do not have to pay anything there be some extra visual item that you can purchase deck back etc but they have absolutely no bearing on gameplay and they be strictly there if you want to change some cosmetic feature and or support the developer even without spend money new cosmetic option be available to you fairly often again the current player base would love to see the community grow many player be very pro and competitive but be great to learn from and sup friendly i be more casual but really enjoy the strategy of this type of card game i also feel the art style be really cool without be too weird gross or overtly sexualize i would not feel weird about other see me play this game unlike a couple other ccgs out there,pos
2955,early access reviewsome aspect of the game be appeal include the large variety of vehicle however when it boil down to it the blatantly pay2win business model alienate anyone who do not whip out their credit card and floaty gunplay make this game only worth a bit of fun with friend rather than something you would pour a lot of free time into,neg

2967,early access reviewas of now the game be early access so thing may change but as for now this game be pretty great it be an interesting take on the moba genre that i think have a pretty nice payoff the ship all have their own fun ability that make the game all drastically different from one another as for graphic even on low setting this game look amazing and the ship themselves all have rad design the texture could use a little work at the moment especially on the asteroid in the different area i can not wait to see what more come of this game good on ya edge case,pos

2971,oh where to begin with neverwinter now this review will most likely bring on a lot of controversy but who care neverwinter be a f2p mmorpg publish by perfect world now a lot of perfect world game tend to be pay to win to the extreme neverwinter be not pay to win unlike the other the only thing to win in neverwinter be pvp but pvp be not a big part of the game itself and there be no item you can pay real life money for to help you in pvp of course neverwinter have an in game currency call zen that you can pay real life money for but the only thing zen let you buy be fashion item dye companion mount and a few other item not essential to own now of course like many other mmo in game currency like zen can allow you to pay for convenience such as buy a fast mount mount serve no purpose other than get you where you need to go at a quick rate rather than walk be that pay to win no it be not what be you win a race to the quest area people do not like spend real life money on mmos but the game be free be it not so complain be silly anways the main currency in neverwinter that require no real life money to earn be call astral diamond you do not want to spend real life money on neverwinter have no fear with ad you can purchase companion mount and plenty of other neat item though for a price 25k ad be the max you can earn with your daily quest however every dungeon you play you have a 90 chance of obtain a purple item purple item sell for a fair amount of ad on the auction house whether its to 20k or 1mill so really earn ad be not an issue me i have play neverwinter since beta two year ago and have never spend a dime to get the cool item i desire i just play the game and earn ad which as state before be not as hard as people say it to be the point of play a game be earn what you want and work towards your goal but many be lazy and do not want to work for what they want i also forget to mention if you really want something off the zen market but have no desire to pay real life money for exclusive item on it do you know you can trade ad for zen be not that nice that neverwinter allow you to do that they give you every option in the game to get what you want without pay a single cent i do not know about you but that s very nice especially for a free game in game event also happen often and every event give you a chance to get a very unique item of some kind whether its so a very cool fast mount a strong companion or just a silly item like a portable throne now let talk about the worker behind neverwinter that be really a great group of people they constantly work hard daily to keep neverwinter run add new content very often and keep it bug free the employee be also very easy to get ahold of and they be the most helpful bunch that will assist you with anything you need its very important for a game to have that they also play neverwinter and they even take the time to play with player in game and occasionally help out people in need how cool be that they also stream on twitch often and give away in game item and even phsyical item like t shirt so overall neverwinter be one of the best free to play mmo out right now there be a reason i have be play this game since beta it even have an epic story line unlike many other mmos that do not like everybody else i skip dialog i do not care i just want to play with neverwinter everything about it whether its to the lore or story line be so very intriguing and make you want to really understand what s go on and pay attention neverwinter be also very visually stunning and the amount of work and detail put into this game be really quite amazing do not believe me check out my screenshot and look at my neverwinter one you will also see that i have an epic mount easily obtain by earn ad like mmorpg want a game full of endless content you can spend countless hour on do you like dungeon and dragon then take the time to play neverwinter atm,pos

2973,early access reviewthis game make me want to run away from my computer and never turn it back on again it be surprising how scary a game that look like it be make in 1995 can be you end up sprint through every room know that if you stay still for just a moment you be likely to get rip to peice and some horrible annimation will come up on the screen that would be enough to give your child future mental issue and kill off your grandma so you run and you run even from the sound come from everywhere and you run straight into a guy that want to put a pin through your eyeball and turn you into one of his puppet my advice would be assume everybody and everything want to kill you do not explore just run as fast as you can into a cardboard cut out of a pumpkin that will jump out at you and that in any other situation would not be all that bad but here it make you fall backwards off your chair oh and do not look behind you all you will see be a guy with a machete try to hack you up or a ghost girl that want to eat your brain or some green guy that for some reason seem reallyoff with you as if you have not get enough on your plate already they all move in a creepy way and they be pretty scary when you catch a glimpse of them great game 10 10 would love to see update graphic in the future though,pos

2994,early access reviewso i have play my fair share of this and find out alot about it and to make a long list short pro can be fun fast fps gameoh man the con find alot of the map be unbalanced or really one side the skill level matchup be uneven and can again be one sided alot of one shoot one kill position around map that almost lead to spawn which make spawncamping often alot of spawncamping also you can not gain tracktion if you begin to loose in tdm which often lead to defeat basically it be an fast simple game with quite alot of thing to equip but have to earn credit and buy grenade for an extended period of time 1 3 7 etc day do not make sense besides keep the player from hog all the credit the map can be either symmetrical mirrored or onesided which can be good or bad and with one sided i mean one of the team have well holding and or ambush position well line of sight or just more cover the weapon be quite nice i be very fond of the start weapon until switch weapon from knife while run to gun at contact be out of sync with my reaction time which mean i get kill even though i be fire but the animation be too slow to actually fire anything at all may just be me that have not get the hang of it but annoying as hell i find the overall skill level strange in one map you compete against equal and have a good fight then the next map you can get demolish or demolish them it be often the map you play that determine the outcome can not really recommend this before they have tweak some of the content and i will not come back before that either,neg
2995,early access reviewthis game be very fast paced and simple in a good way the sound and the graphic be nice the gameplay be quick and satisfying and honestly it be nice to play team death match again with all the battle royal and overwatch style objective shooter trend it be nice to turn off your mind for a bit and just shoot people it really bring me back to the reason i start play shooting game in the first place just fast pace gameplay where all you need to worry about be kill and be kill i like that you can get all the gun without spend any money though if you want to look cool with a skin you may have to shell out quite a bit the drop rate in the loot crate be god awful at the moment i be hope the chance get well to give us at least a little hope also not that important but it would be cool to be able to make a few change to your character model other than straight replace it with acompletely different character to get a little variety and personalization go it be nice to have the choice to mute team all chat for when you really just do not want to hear any of it it give player the change to say what they want in chat without bother people who do not want to be involve in trash talk offend since they can just perma mute chat overall i have def enjoy the game so far and will continue play long term most likely maybe one day i will even be good at the game,pos
2996,just put it this way the game be f2p its an rpg lot of folk play you can still quest and do dungeon even without the super rare legendary i have be play a lot long than you gear could the game use some more work yeah but the way it be the game be still decent imo they should focus on improve the game overall rather than keep release new module or at least focus on game mechanic etc for next two major update then go back to release module i may not have a lot of time invest in the game to voice my opinion about the game overall but i like rpg and while i be not a hardcore player i be sure somebody would value this opinion review,pos
2997,early access reviewfinally eternal card game be the game wizard of the coast should have create 10 year ago have wizard create an accessible attractive and intuitive occg base on mtg they would be the dominant player in the market go on a decade now however their short sightedness and unwillingness to experiment with their ip mean we have to wait for eternal to scratch our magic itch hex while a beautiful and intricate game lack the accessible and intuitive aspect that hearthstone and eternal meet the gameplay in eternal be rock solid take core ccg mechanic and tie them to color similar to mtg currently the color be not as stratify as mtg which allow for more versatile single color deck while offer expand option for multi colored deck eternal after my 10 hour of play or so so take it with a grain of salt seem less focused on define the metagame itself unlike hearthstone and to some extent mtg where the meta minus minor tweaking be establish within day of a new set come out largely by the developer this be for 2 reason the core mechanic introduce in hearthstone expansion be usually the most efficient jade single copy bomb like reno and kazakus etc and the limited card pool simply do not allow much experimentation although i be just start with eternal it appear that there be a decent range of creature removal large creature and the like in each color along with some strong but not force theme like echo and void play while eternal have a mana mechanic it be automate this mean the game set your mana curve for you limit your optimal mana ratio however i assume they do it to remove complexity from deck building which be a good thing when try to bring in more casual player the game offer a plethora of mana fixing card as well in both colorless and colored card to allow well control of your mana flow so far i have only be mana hose on a couple of occasion in most game mana have tend to be plentiful often to the point of excess as my early game tend to go long while i build my collection and create more efficient deck eternal thankfully do away with the tiny card pack of hearthstone and hex and have 12 card per pack very close to the 14 minus the land in a mtg pack at 1 pack not count the ability to draft guantlet or forge for free card dust the pack size value ratio be exceptional compare to hex mtgo and hearthstone currently the game mode available be gauntlet forge rank and draft as someone who like to play mostly solo as i build a collection the game mode be very close to perfect gauntlet be a free pve construct tournament mode and can be use to grind gold and some usually common or uncommon card with a perfect 7 win record earn a card pack as well the ai mode seem well design to offer player good reward as the player base could probably not accommodate pvp in each forge be eternal arena a seal deck format where you build a deck from random set of 3 card again the game assign your mana it appear though i have only play once but do get a perfect 7 win that once you have choose 2 color of card all remain pick be of those 2 color this be a very nice feature and prevent someone from get pretty far off track into 5 color though i be certain there be some who would actually like that arena cost 2500 gold to enter the 7 win run earn me 3500 gold a couple of card and 4 card pack so a little more than 3 1 value you be allow 2 loss before your run end as you be play an ai it seem this mode offer a pretty fair chance to hit 7 win if you be good at seal in ccgs if the deck the ai be play do not get more challenging as you rank up in forge it should be pretty easy to go infinite i have only play a few game of rank just enough to get a win for a quest as i doubt i be prepared to face construct deck quite yet the mode work fine and even with only about 2k player online at any time the matchmaking only take a little longer than hearthstone the casual mode be currently offline i be guess until a large player base mean it will not cause extended queue time i have not draft yet but i will update my review when i do overall eternal be a great entry to the crowded online ccg market and outside of hearthstone may be the one to succeed with player who want something a little deep than blizzard game the nitpick i have with the game be minor i think the art look a little small on the play table and i be on a 27 monitor though it be fine when zoom in as a once upon a time competitive magic player that quit mainly due to mana randomness i prefer a hearthstone style consistently build mana pool however it be not a game breaker and i have not notice it be as much of a problem as i have in my ptq qualifier day if you be a magic player that want deep mechanic but still slick up hearthstone style experience eternal be your game,pos
2998,this be a very good game once you get past the tutorial and for a game port from the phone it really be not that bad its free and it be yu gi oh what else do i really have to say like its constanly update and there be ton off special event also if you be cry about the damn volume during the download turn it down from volume manager turn your headset down un plug your pc during download or important window update stop cry about the small thing and life and grow up like seriously,pos

3000,have a good chance but it be be a year since i have play it and when i instal it recently it be still not optimize with huge frame issue from go really high fps to low fps too frequently and when you jump from a moderate hight your character glitch into the ground but you do not get stuck or anything just look ugly overall to many frame issue that be still present a year later make the game feel less progress then it should if the optimization issue go away then i would deffinanlty give it a good review i will check back in a few month,neg
3001,i be not an expert on this type of game but can say that tiny tower nimblebit circa 2014 be way less infuriating and way more engaging i have play both on mobile and on pc the game be much more suited for mobile but it be too difficult on a small screen attacker at the door then a stray touch easy to do on bezel less and curved screen phone would zoom way in on a random spot on the screen zoom back out try to grab a 3 mm tall guy on the screen but can not do that until the resource be collect collect the resource misclick try to tap hold the guy 3 more time zoom back in grab him slowly drag him to the vault door at max zoom have the screen not register your finger for a moment while drag him scroll back down to that room grab him again and finally stick him in the front room now check his weapon try sort the weapon list but still have to go through a list of 15 weak weapon to find your one rare legendary that you stick on someone after a fail rush now you have 1 defender of course the fight halfway over now people be dead now watch slow mostly passive combat with quirky seemingly redundant control be we have fun yet terrible experience bore as hell and now you have waste 8 hour of travel time because you want to save a few medpack for incident emergency later once you finally get a little resource security and medpack capacity even if you do not have a radio station watch deathclaw rip through your entire vault while you try to stop them with hunt rifle equivalent rage quit come back a bit later get hit with deathclaw again before you have even be able to heal up from the first attack live in constant fear of the next deathclaw attack or even the next scorpion attack now that you be out of medpack and rush them be too risky the next attack could wipe out your entire vault extremely mismatched risk for a game that be mostly plan and hand off wait the good way to avoid lose your vault be to keep the game close as much as possible lol next day your phone screen turn on once in the middle of the night wake up to a pile of body and no way to roll back to the last save give up on that vault there be so much wait that you will probably have the same result after fall asleep during all the excitement try switch to pc to deal with pain of move defender around to incident but it be almost as much a pita as on android also the tap zooming be ridiculous i just want to turn it off completely and only have it respond to mousewheel zoom positive appropriately price base game the humor be legitimately great especially for fallout fan cloud save do not work between steam and android but you can manually transfer unaltered savefile between the two platform you can also back up these file but it be kind of a pain possible to edit your save if you can resist do thing that will ruin progression critical hit meter be cool epically soporific excitement wait 7 minute for your medpack to finish 3 hour for your baby dweller 3 more for them to grow up 7 hour for your special point training 6 hour for your team to get to a diner to fight a radroach 8 hour for your scavenger to return and 4 day for your weapon all intermix with deathclaw panic negative freemium or not i expect a lot more from a major studio in term of design the basic interface interaction have none of the refinement friendliness of your average knock off clash game and there be a lot to be desire in term of quality of life also deathclaw be ridiculously unbalanced at early level start on android but load of problem constant crash have to reload game twice each time after it have be fully shut down quest would take like 10 second of loading screen usually follow by a crash this be on probably the most popular flagship phone run oreo coudnt get it past the savefile screen on memu either hey bethesda maybe hire some mobile dev on day 1 my phone actually warn me the app have crash 10 time and that it be slow down my phone if you could turn deathclaw off in normal mode or if the control do not so often get in the way of react quickly eg preset loadout or pause game while use equipment garrison interface i would be way more excited about this game edit oh yeah and the rush sage be absolute garbage 40 90 this mechanic be not clever or challenging it be just dumb give their obnoxious interface the number should 1 accurately reflect the base rate obviously and 2 visibly change base on the luck modifier present so you do not have to tediously check every dweller setup whoever design this mechanic should see if mcds be hire,neg

3032,if you be a fan of minecraft and all the feature that make it good this game will disappoint you the major issue with this game be 1 the developer have an ego they do not actually listen to the community despite the lie that pr spout and be patronizing to the community while claim to listen to them 2 there be no option for texture pack mod single player or creative mode the most demand feature by the community see 1 none of the feature would be hard to do and keep it free either 3 it be very sub par on the survival side of thing it be generally too easy to get to top tier equipment and there be not very much equipment to get in the first place farming be slow and awful this be where modding would help but playful treat the topic like it be heresy 4 the exploration be very underwhelming after about an hour it become a recur theme of oh i have see this before there be no village no dungeon no monument no random building limit biome variety limit mob variety etc 5 it be a bit expensive oh but it be free to play accord to pr well technically yes but like it or not the game have achieve pay to win status sure none of the core feature be lock behind a pay wall but literally all additional texture and the cool equipment absolutely be lock behind a pay wall heck there have be entire update that have most of the content lock behind a pay wall want the good stuff expect to pay 70 for this game 6 it deserve to be repeat the dev do not care about the community when they claim to listen what they mean be that they cherry pick the request they like and implement them then give themselves glorious fanfare on blog and social medium to the tune of look how much we listen,neg

3036,in my opinion it be the good action rpg that be on the market right now it have a grim setting and a story that be mostly tell through environmental bit of lore but most importantly it have a depth of gameplay that no other arpg come even close to it be the good spiritual successor to diablo ii to date the first time you open the passive skill tree you be likely to be overwhelm there be a web with hundred of choice do not worry eventually it will make sense you can obtain respect point via quest and item drop so you can not mess anything up permanently anyway your active skill be acquire by put skill gem into socket on your gear the gem have one of three colour red blue green that match with the colour of the socket on your gear socket can be link allow you to attach support gem to your active skill gem this can do thing such as split your burn arrow into 4 projectile or turn your glacial hammer attack into an aoe attack that hurt monster all around you later in the game you can even find support gem that can trigger active skill gem automatically once you take enough damage or get stun every three month the dev launch a major patch with a new challenge league which add new skill new game mechanic and challenge which offer new loot reward and cosmetic the free to play model be truly free to play you can play all the content in the game without pay a dime the only way the game developer make money be by offer microtransaction in their store for cosmetic upgrade that do not affect gameplay want your mismatched set of gear to have a unified look maybe shop for a set of cosmetic armor look want your fireball to look like a dragon there be a microtransaction for that want a lizard with a bell on it be back to follow you around like a puppy there be a microtransaction for that i have put hundred of hour into the game use their native client because i start play before the game be on steam and find buy the microtransaction to be a good way to support the developer so they can continue to add more and more and more and more content to the game while also make my character look awesome via the cosmetic microtransaction there be a few non cosmetic microtransaction available to upgrade your account with more character slot i believe the default be 12 so that be enough to create at least one character of each of the 7 class and to get more share stash tab to hoard all the item you find and share them between your character the default you get be 4 which people be start to argue be enough when the game launch in 2013 but be a little cramped for all the content we have now in 2016 there be also premium stash tab that allow you to rename the stash tab and give their label colour the game be free so why be you read this review instead of play the game,pos

3038,the simplicity of the game be what make the game so fun and easy to learn but insanely difficult to master and i can not tell you how much fun it be to learn how to play each class when i first brance out into other class for real be when mvm come out and i be practically force to play other role to support the team and at that point it be when i realize i have love for more than just the sniper and spy and i could learn to enjoy all the other class too there be always something of each class everybody can enjoy maybe not everybody but why do i hate this game even though i give it a good rating the fact that this game be slowly die and to me it seem like valve seem to care less and less about tf2 and just scrap up community map for new update and shove in skin and try to squeeze as much money as they can the last update be not terrible it have me play for a couple more hour but it be not enough to bring me back to the good old day not only that but the price of trade only increase and never seem to stabalize and constantly fluctuate which make trading dead unless you have unsual on you but why bother leave a good review you may ask because the only thing that tf2 seem to do right compare to every other game out there in the market be that no matter how much i hate this game get bored of it and realize how it be die every month or so i will eventually come back to it anyway the game be amazing and i can not deny it even if i want to tl dr i ing hate this game but you should definetly still play it because i love it 12 10 would definetly get stab by a spy again,pos

3040,early access reviewive not play much of this game so its fair to say that i have not be able to experience all the feature however i already see the aspect of the game which need emphasise and the problem of this game the game be early access so it have the odd bug a multicoloured polygon game spring to mind but this be not something to get angry about in game before its official release the team work on this be small but the game be often update as be the outline plan and community engagement be fantastic from artix entertainment it be the nostalgia of my playing aq world almost ten year ago that draw me to this game it have some of the same charm and humour but not to the same extent at time the game can feel like its try to hard to be what its predecessor be the big question when it come to this game be whether try to make the game accessible for mobile gamer have limit its appeal and enjoyment for pc gamer the answer in short be yes the camera feel clunky and the game very much feel like its design for regular visit and clicking which could be do on a small screen the classic trope of mmos grind quest be definitely frequent toward the point of tediousness some redesign be definitely need in term of quest placement and objective my main suggestion in this field would be to drop about half the quest often quest be very small possibly to make it them completable on the move and so double the reward for the remainder with a slight increase in difficulty i think its more important to feel a sense of accomplish in term of achievement rather than in gear the game do not feel like a life experience in the same way as other some mmo and rpgs include aq world do but more like the repetitive formula of a grind for gear rather than a quest to accomplish a task thus the problem be that the game feel far too much like a classic mmo and not enough like the game it could be perhaps essentially what be need be a slightly alter 3d version of the of artixs more successful 2d game another problem be the craft system when you collect enough raw material npc craft shop can make this into gear for a price this be quite basic and nothing i really have a problem with the issue lie in the need to wait a set about of time a minute an hour a day etc in order to collect your new gear it slow the game and when you collect the item it can sometimes be that it no longer feel worth the time as you have level up and find new equipment to use the question that i think it come down to ask yourself be whether it be well to invest your time in a game mid development or a game in what be essentially the dlc phase should you play adventurequest 3d or aq world for me get back into the latter be very daunting with so much content one of the reason i often avoid mmo be because i feel so out of my depth when compare to player who have be around for so much longer the 3d game be lack but it have fantastic potential and will hopefully grow into the game it could be its worth take the time to try this game before dismiss it especially for people who play artix game some year ago,pos

3048,with my hour in this i beleive i can give a credible opinion on this game i reccomend this game if you be plan on play this game every once in a while as with this game terrible grind system you will not be get too far down the tech tree i play both tank and aircraft and it seem the balance go down the drain the further you get and the match get less and less enjoyable plane be great although the russian aircraft get really annoying as a bit less than half the player i it seem bring them into battle i love american tech and vehicle so i primary them and then the germans for both game mode and it from what i experience everything in the american lineup be not as good as the other it be put up against this be mostly direct for ground force a massive chunk of the early tree be make up of the m4 sherman type tank and its great at first but when you use the same gun for 5 tank down the same tree face tiger and panther and break t34 it become incredibly stale now that i have 2 6 0 tank go into battle be now a complete waste of time i usually when i play ground force get 4 5 kill per match but now i be get less than 300 rp and barely a single assist my advice be to either 1 pay for premium golden eagle to boost your way out of the terrible 5 7 mess of a matchmaking or quit and play another of the faction until you hit that point it after hundred of hour of work be incredibly dissappointing,neg

mako from mass effect 1 m 44 hammerhead from mass effect 2 ut 47a kodiak from mass effect 3 terran diamondback from starcraft 2 terran aratmatmatmatme mercenary siege tank yes the siege breaker from wing of liberty but none of that matter when the base physics of the game have be modify from what be establish the weapon continuously nerfe until be 6 foot under reward be lower with improvment to the system and a plethora of other problem back in early 2014 i strongly i repeat strongly support this game strongly i emphasize this say it with me strongly support this game but with every step forward freejam have show they intend to take two step back every time clone war so let us first start off with the removal of all the nice cool gadget that be originally available right at the start this include the hoverblade plasma launcher railgun and thruster from level 1 upward of level 3 yes this happen freejam do not change this until 7 month later when people stop cry and moan for it to come back double edge butt atmatmatmatmery now prior to this they also make some modification to the reward system add a repair function to the game which put a drain on casual player tier 6 and up back then what be the kick in the ball here a 25 decrease in reward yes both rp and tp robopoint and techpoints hero zero next up be the hero system which allow you to get the full rp and tp from a match you die in if your team win but wait at the cost of the entire reward system get another 25 decrease at this point manage to make enough money to get new part be an uphill battle and at a 50 reward decrease that have remain permanent to this day it be be a massive pain in theatmatmatmatmatm turn up for hate now next up they remove repair cost yet yet again another freaking reward quantity decrease you get the pattern yet do not worry i will explain it in a second at this point it get rediculous but oh no there be even more from intense to indense this game be always a one life team death match game the respawne and overclocke update have kill everything that make it original and turn it into a confused moba wannabe even bad be that they have now set the original mode now name classic so far on the back burner it can take from 5 minute to 3 hour just to get on a match gradually decrease the time need to even get into one with each tier you go up but heres the final blow to the old mode a 80 decrease at this point to the profit you make from it classic be now as worthwhile as dump youratmatmatmatmatmin a toilet or on a development team think that be the bad part oh no i be not even finish what be wrong with my atmatmatmatming keyboard the control with any movement design other than tank tread will feel so obliterate you will literally ask yeah that be right the subtitle of this paragraph as of the r o update wheel be incredibly sluggish rocket provide minimal momentum hoverblade be highly unstable if you lose even one aerofoil be a disaster to use walker leg be bloody hell to even keep still on a ceiling or a steep hill if you want to stay in place and believe me it be go to walk down to the surface on you while you shoot and lastly the rotor blade design be sluggish as well thisatmatmatmatmatmatmgenuinely bring my p ss to a plasmatic boil the challenge should not be in handicap the atmatmatmatme player give us ur monie why all the reward debuff because they want money they want to force the playerbase to purchase premium currency so that they can accelerate their growth to a level they can remotely tolerate this game never do have a fair free to play model but it be now skewed beyond any conceivable belief and also no it be not even classify as pay to win it be pay to atmatmatmatme progress give us ur monie 2 1 the introduction of easy anti cheat or eac instead of use steam vac system which work very well and still mostly do make no sense either they decide to use a third party system that not only people have always second guess but never trust and never be comfortable with you see where this be go yeah they drive off a number of their player base state if you can not get into robocraft to play because of eac that be a small price to pay for the issue of hacker try to ruin our game the only people who try to help fix this be eac themselves as i recall and even then only under the pressure of the robocraft community which have already start leave give us ur ferkign muneez 11 eleven why do eac have to fix it because freejam be too dumbfounded watch the star shine out of their fat frigging assh0les to do it themselves aside from the matter of the development companys profoundly horrendous inexperience in stop hacker in the first place but it do not even end there they will not respond to crticism kindly light or dark which be why i be not sugarcoat this not even an ounce they will not listen to reason no matter how kindly you put it if they do not like youratmatmatmatmatm you better be prepare for the ban hammer because they silence any and all feedback that involve any kind of actual review with a vengeance and hell this have not even end yet keep read this be start to look like the robocraft holocaust shudder nerf em to the grave now the final kick to the ball here and you may not get up from this one be the repeat nerfing of weapon that have perform perfectly fine and the buffing of weapon that never even need a buff finally there be the issue of render certain vehicular design completely obsolete promote the uncreative design of gun brick with tank tread and tank tread only i will give an example from speedy to needy i make a vehicle call the masterkill b stard frankly can not put the word itself in which operate on two thing wheel downforce and rocket asssiste forward momentum as of 3 day after the r o update my speedy little vehicle be no fast than a treaded tank and that be with the thruster on i guess people can not stand have to exercize their arm hand and finger with the corsshair on their railgun and enjoy the game because this actually happen without rocket it be even slow than a tank believe me i have test this one the day i learn of the horror inflict on the physics engine which i think it be safe to say it be nearly nonexistant now final thought lastly like i say i strongly strongly support this game hell i even put 10 into this game just for hangar bay but as of now freejam have botch their game so much yield to the manipulation of their own community so badly that it be nigh unenjoyable this game have so much potential a year ago but now it be all be dry up freejam have make it evidently clear they do not want to take a step in the right direction a year ago i would give this game a 9 5 out of 10 but as of now i can only in good conscience give it a 4 out of 10 a toxic community confuse development team nonsensical gameplay poor teamplay or constant nerf as a double edge to update and absolutely horrible physics engine torture to death by modification of what it once be all in the name of stay away from make the game overall better simple for personal profit keep me from dare touch this awful nightmare any more after this stay away from this hideous deformed child of a game you will be stricken with it be god awful moba wannabe gameplay more on my review in the comment section,neg
3052,early access reviewhello i be new but i can not go across to speak about bless online i hade in mind this game after all this publicity they make will be like bdo or similar game well i do not hear or read comment about this game and wish make my owen experience whit it after only well 26 hour gameplay i need to say this game if they do not do a big upgrade in all graphic gameplay story line even be simply thing like mount this game will die faster then it come to europe that s my opinion so to say well this game be far from that what they have promis at the start,neg
3053,from many hour of experience i can safely say that this be an amazing and addicting game for people who like to challenge themselves while play with other people dota 2 can indeed be hard for beginner but once you get use to the game you will be enjoy yourself more as long as you be not one of those people who rage quickly and end up abandon thing can be improve to make this game more enjoyable such as the toxcitiy of player which drag many player away from this game but nonetheless in my opinion this game be a great game second edit dota 2 2018 review lot of read ahead it be be a year since the duel fate update and 2 year since the 7 00 update from what i have personally experience in this year of dota i can now say that the game be change a lot many change and introduction have occur in 2018 from the ranked medal to the 7 20 update start from the medal which where the first introduction in 2018 i have personally always like the medal idea and do not really seem to have problem with them be add to the game i personally find that they be suit since many other game have medal for rank why should not dota the next perhaps big thing which be announce in mid february of 2018 be what be know as the bi weekly patch update in a nutshell icefrog have finally speak and look down upon us peasents and finally say we will be release update every two week which will release feature slowly instead of all in one go on a single patch yes people the frog have speak all this be due to the community complain about valve not care so much about update and give way too few hah the irony be that when the bi weekly patch come people eventually hate more on valve for the amount of space they be take up on their hard drive so eventually after the international 2018 championship have come to an end the bi weekly patch just dissapeare the next huge addition to the game be dotaplus which be suppose to apparently be an evolution of the seasonal battlepasse what s my opinion on this well let put it this way about dotaplus what a ing joke people literally only buy it for the hero level so they can have a little badge which show their progression on hero they play for the battlecup because at least dota plus owner get free battlecup tournament access and also for the ranked role a new thing that replace the double down mmr in rank matchmaking which btw take a que time as long as 40 min to an entire hour even not say it still do not infact it be bad from what i have hear in a nutshell pay 3 50 a month so you can have the ability to choose which role you want to search for in rank matchmaking for some weird reason rank role be not the normal way of matchmaking and all those who do not have dotaplus or do not really feel like wait 40 min to find a game around 80 of player will just be stick with me mid or feed oryour mamma pretty much what you see in the eu server nowadays yea pretty disturbing but that just about sum dotaplus in a nutshell next up be spring clean this update be simply amazing and i do hope we get one again for 2019 my favourite bit of this update be the new look of in game player profile must commend valve for this one great work after that come the long await pudge arcana pretty amazing overall especially with a hero like pudge who do not really seem extensive for an arcana i mean it be pudge we be talk about but they do it and it be pretty decent what could have make the arcanum soo much well be a new hook animation not just use the right hand hook but also the back chain hook then again this be my opinion jump ahead we see a lovely summer season kick off summer 2018 with the international 2018 championship battlepass which bring about the lakad matatag meme and it be just beutiful the tournament be great a massive applause to og once again very well deserved towards the end of the tournament day 2 new hero by the name mars and grimstroke be announce and on that day people freak out especially when grimstroke be literally release right after the trailer reveal him autumn come and naturally people be expect a traditional post ti patch to be fully specific the 7 20 patch when 7 20 debutte back on the 19th of november it bring about a lot of change people be wonder how to even play the game anymore i mean bounty hunter now steal gold from enemy when he hit them deny give gold slark gain permanent agility if he or an ally who be next to him get a kill the update in my personal opinion need desperate balance this of course naturally happen and literally 4 sub patch be release in a month but eventually i personally adapt and some of my friend who be at the ancient level have either quit play the game or take a massive break with questionable return tomorrow the start of 2019 the ranked season 3 be expect to debut along a possible update to rank matchmaking which we hope will be effective or at least a lot more effective than previous update to rank matchmaking mars be nowwhere to be see yet but valve say winter so as far as we be concern it could be on the 20th of march althought if you want to see him early buy a mega telescope and find where mars be in the night sky hah good luck with that but seriously do not buy a mega telescope use it to buy dotaplus instead lol the last but not least thing that happen and be soon go to end be the frosthaven event along with the long anticipate rubick arcana release frosthaven be decent but in my opinion frostivu of 2017 be much well as for the rubick arcana it be pretty nice and i would rate it just as much as the pudge arcana to conclude the review of dota 2 in 2018 this year have change load of change i will say it be a decent year for dota 2 it be not amazing but there be great stuff release aswell to cover up for that so one last thing before we conclude 2018 do i still recommend dota 2 as a game the answer be yes it be still amazing and i hope it will become even great in 2019 because for some reason i sense 2019 will be the good year for dota 2 ever we will see in a year time if i be right and wrong i guess i hope you all have a happy new year dark if you wish to find my 2017 review of dota 2 please click the link

3054,early access reviewthe game be good now a great pile of c r a p comunitly bearly good support team do not give fudge about you i wonder how long this game be go to keep it up not so long i guess many many many many many bug which dev team and support also do not give a fudge about balance in every single aspect be horribleat the end i do not recommend the game no matter the fact that be f2p with microtransaction by look of the other review you can see people be not so fascinated another thing to the guy who create this pile of c r a p i know it be not easy to create develop a game but after a hard work dev the good game you waste your hard work time on slowly but succesfully up the game that be not effective waste of your develop time and by that i mean you s u c k at your profession feel free to ban me if this insult you because i know you ban other player without any good reason and clue it will not be a new thing if you be vent on player who leave a bad review,neg
3055,early access reviewthis be a good game that get some unfair negative review and hate i be go to address some unfair attack at this game the big thing about these negative steam review be that anybody can write them thus many loser player with idiot tank design come here to take out their anger on the game store page this be partly thank to the chat window in the game main lobby where countless 9 year old tell the whole server why they lose because smgs be cheap and not because they rush in alone with their no armor hovercraft in between 5 enemy tank when other normal player lose to an smg tank they see the chat and believe the exaggerated comment and join them then they start vent their anger too the other slightly more fair review i have see be from the old time player who say the game dev ruin the game i be a little new at this than them and i have play almost 40 hour of gameplay in these dark time make it to t5 and have fun all the way and there s no sign of the fun stop any time soon the people who be have fun and there s a lot of us do not bother to write review just the people who want to vent their anger do the first thing people say be that this game be pay2win but that just be not true first of all pay user and free user get all the same part to work with and second in this game your robot have a stat for rank when you add a part to your robot it raise the rank stat and if you reach a certain point it will go up in tier there be 10 tier of robot and you just about always get put against robot in your tier so pay 2 win be impossible the only thing pay do for you be give you fast progression through the tier some people say its pay to progress but i be on top of t5 and i have not have that problem yet although i think during a certain update it be bad but they have already fix that by now progression be not super important anyway because by t5 every type of part be unlock just not the big strong version which be in there own tier unlike world of tank and other f2ps you can still make cool stuff at low tier and there s none of that premium ammo crud that i hate now for the second big thing to talk about op over powered weapon and part every type of weapon get call op 90 time in the same day because of that vent 9 year old thing i tell you about before one big thing to keep in mind be that this game be in alpha so balance be subject to change i hate when people say plasma have ruin this game forever because even if plasma be cheap the dev would rebalance it asap there be only 3 different type of weapon in the game for now and they all have their intend function i be not say the game have always have perfect balance and it still do not but its still a lot of fun to play the last thing about balance be that a lot of player be new to this game and do not know what they can do an example would be that hovercraft can dodge plasma shell vertically but i do not see many player do this those player could go on to say that plasma be cheap or that hovercraft be underpowered but the real problem be that the player do not try new tactic people whine a little about other thing like lag warping and glitch but i have never have those problem those thing be just more problem that people unfairly vent out during their rant overall i just want to tell you that this be a really fun game that can make you think and adapt and also that the dev be not evil i think they give us free stuff as makeup for a server crash they have if the game get big and dev finish this right then this could be a really great and solid game thank for read peace out,pos
3056,  you know those moment in life where we question be this the life that i want or be i ever go to achieve my drem and carry on with my life and later we drown in a deep self pitty with a pinch of crippling depression well this game pretty much prevent that from happen,pos

3058,early access reviewthis be a good game nice shooting mechanic sound and the atmosphere be on spot but i would rather they lose the cutlery and add ww2 inspire clothing armor instead of wackiness it would be a well marketing point people in 40 clothing fighting thru the mist to get to a safe zone it be very lovecraftian please change the project asap and give it a twist of horror instead of wacky underpant game will get more follower,pos
3059,early access reviewthis game be free how 10 10about 300 room in game start of very simple just cardboard picture of cartoon like ghost and skeleton eventually sh t start get creepy thing start chase you and as research lab database show there be tonne of monster to come the deeper you go i love the mini game a great relief from the game jump scare although i think jump scare be cheap and far too many game use them and go on to tag them as a horror game fnaf this game use them effectively create an eerie atmosphere and make you jump out of your chair at even the cut cardboard cut out while be chase by a head eat resident evil like monster this game have a strange effect as i want to continue on just one room more i tell myself even though that one room could either be a single corridor which i nervously walk down or a dark room in which you magically obtain a flashlight worth the a000 00 i invest and i be look forward to the 1000th room if i ever get there game play 8 10helpless at the start and so far still like that control be simple but work effectively graphic 9 10simple cartoon at start but develop to much dark image polish 8 10funny spooky girl detailed backlog of each monster and fear what more to ask for,pos
3060,ok i will never write a review about any game before but wt deserve one first of all i have be play the game for a couple of year now and it be amazing the vehicle the physics the map everything but suddenly the game become a pay to win game since premium vehicle be so op the vehicle research be ridiculous because it take really a long time to be able to get a new plane or tank and now you can face a 50 or 60 tank with sabot round while you be drive a 40 tank con guy i will not even get to the russian bias part cause seem that gaijin still have not overcome the cold war but the bad part in this once great game be that you will get uptiered every single game no kidding i have get uptiered at every game for the past 2 day my top tank be 5 7 still i be face 6 7 tank or hig so i will not recomend the game untill gaijin stop think only about money and start to think a little about the many issue that the game have thank for read it,neg
3061,excellent game that be really easy to play people say its hard for phone people against pc player its not i play on both its completely fine this game be excellent be without a doubt the next good armoured warfare game on steam after war thunder the game be quick and easy to get the hang of the playerbase be really good as compare to other game and after the first few what the heck game you may have its a really good game,pos
3062,great game with many hero to pick from and fight against its definitly worth your time but do remember that hi rez studios the developer and publisher be absalout cancer and most of their game be bad smite however be the exception and be good fun with friend or alone,pos
3063,this game have an amazing way of make grind unique and fun as for get new card without grinding can be difficult because of the lack of card that you can buy from the store and because those card that be in the store be kinda useless but nonetheless amazing game 8 10,pos
3064,early access reviewserver can be a bit off and tooltip be nonexistant in this agme but the core mechanic be sufficiently unique to warrant a good game what sell it be the shooting though real satisfy stuff,pos
3065,early access reviewdear mammoth game i have be play this game for 2 year now and i really feel like i can not play anymore ever since dodging have be remove there be no counter for spam at all which make play this game very frustrating this game be my favorite game of all time until you remove dodge at the moment i will not be play this game again please reconsider remove dodge,neg
3066,overall i would recommend it to anyone you progress quite quickly through the game so money do not have to be spend unless you be really desperate however the big problem be the match make you either smash their team or get smash you can be afk on your team and win with maybe one casualty or work your off and lose awfully this can be fix on future update but apart from that it be a solid game also you can run it on a potato so that be always good,pos
3067,load game create profile get excite due to good looking graphic find out 99 of the content have to be bring start a practice session hold down accelerator spin into the wall change to 3rd person and mouse control fail to go round a corner in gear 2 get crash on pit straight decide to start a race accidentally crash someone end up on my roof and the person who i hit be still go perfectly 11 10 brilliant,pos
3068,dev have lose their sense of reality if a vehicle firepower need to be nerfed unrealistically remove it from the game the stat be break and lack any balance what so ever it look good run good but have zero accuracy on most aspect the game mode be also terrible lacking depth and intellect to even get a more real experience play in more difficult game mode just mean more dumb spawn rule the dev just pile on content instead of expand on what they already have what good be add ten more tank and plane to the game if the game mode be to simple and boring would i recommend this game no,neg
3069,early access reviewif you be look for a free to play card game that combine the good feature of other franchise into one simple and elegant package with tonne of strategic variation and depth you have come to the right place when you start play this game 3 thing hit you immediately 1 the animation be fast and fluid no time be waste on flashy nonsense the animation go through quickly with minimal interruption and still look good so most of your time be spend make decision rather than impatiently watch stuff happen on screen 2 if you be familiar with hearthstone and magic the gathering then this game feel instantly familiar and easy to learn it do not suffer from the rng self destruction vomit that hearthstone have become and it have a much more modern online client interface than the outdated relic of mtg online 3 despite be in early access it already have so much content and even without have a full library of legendary card you have sooo many option in deck construction strategy and interaction without pay a single dime i be so impressed with the elegant design of all the card and in game interface that i buy some of the in game currency just to support the developer but i do not need it you can earn and craft all the card by play very casually there be several mode to play 1 gauntlet against ai deck here you can test your new deck concept and do some casual grinding for gold extremely useful and surprisingly challenging 2 forge also against ai this be basically arena or draft but against ai it cost half as much gold to enter than with draft and the draft itself be cheap anyways forge be good if you love draft arena gameplay but do not like to wait for other player or do not like competitive play too much 3 draft you open a pack and pick one card then you pass it on to someone else and you pick another card from a pack pass by someone else etc until the pack be empty and then you repeat the process for a total of 4 time then you construct a deck from the card you pick and play pvp if you enjoy the competition and have the brain to stay competitive this mode can earn you a lot of gold pack and shiftstone use to craft card good of all you keep the card that you pick include the one you do not use to make your deck 4 rank pvp just like construct in hearthstone nothing special i actually prefer construct over draft due to the incredible creativity of the community but that be just a personal preference i like to test new concept cuz it be so much fun casual pvp but without rank point useful if you just want to enjoy the gameplay and complete quest without affect your current rank 5 event every now and then we get an event with special rule i really like these because they make you think and build your deck in specific way to capitalise on the battlefield condition plus they be incredibly rewarding so it be worth the effort in addition there be quest that require you to play certain color or card type to unlock chest this encourage you to get creative and try new thing just the usual card game incentive i have see most review and steam discussion complain about the resource system mana borrow from magic the gathering indeed you have to play sigil land to gain power mana and play your card truth be tell the number of spell that draw sigil be somewhat limited mtg have many more mana fetch and fix card in eternal you need to give extra attention to include enough sigil fetch card in your deck seek power and find the way be extremely important and card draw engine be a must have in every deck strategy otherwise you will be at the mercy of top deck by turn 7 if you can get accustomed to the mana system and start brainstorm deck idea you be go to love this game especially if you like to be creative if you can not be bother feel free to net deck many new player net deck at first in fact the community be very generous and intelligent and they love to share their idea with new player whatever your playstyle be there be a deck for you feel free to experiment you will be surprise by the magnitude of unlikely synergy you can discover it be very enjoyable to have this eureka moment when test new combo eternal really encourage you to try new card there be a few slightly overused or unbalanced card but most of them be cheap to craft and everything can be easily counter with the right strategy the silence mechanic be particularly powerful and almost essential to counter certain effect i be a little worried about the silence tbh and i really hope they add a revert mechanic similar to hex shard of fate otherwise silence effect would have to be deliberately keep few in number from now on because it be counter interactive and not very fun as far as card game go i give this a solid 7 10 if the dev keep an eye out on card balance and maintain their caution when release new card this game will be an excellent addition to any card game player library especially if you be tired of the old franchise that have become overburdened with their outdated online client try it and keep an open mind you will not be disappoint,pos
3070,tl dr this game be fun it be not pay2win in any kind of way i have read some negative review and have to say something about the p2w aspect it be not pay2win you have to buy well tower and their upgrade with ingame currency which be award by win game you pay to a special amount of coin to play a game if you win you get two time as much back you start with 0 coin and by win 7 game you get a ranking in the world region ladder where reach different rank award a good amount of coin every wednesday so if you start play sunday you get how the game work on monday win a few game on thusday and get the coin on wednesday you have go from 0 to 1000 coin in 3 day and max 30 win after this you could get world first in your second week of play even in the first week because it be play2win on another note you need to win game to unlock the purchase of well tower and their upgrade so once more you need to play to get better also if you do not want to waste your money do not spend any i have about 25000 coin after my first week which be about 100 in reallife,pos
3071,early access reviewi like the game easy on the eye nice physics on movement and shoot not hit a laggy server fast pace but not manic like doom or unreal map remind me of cod black op nuke nice balance between camping and rushing player just over an hour in not see any hacker as yet one of the best free to play shooter i have play in year congrat to the dev nice job guy,pos
3072,early access reviewreally fun card game that s a bit slow than pace than the other popular free to play card game in the marketheavily influence by magic the gathering especailly be able to interact during the opponent turn which be not surprising consider the people behind the game love the arena system that not only let you keep the card you draft but also let you edit your deck something game like hearthstone and shadowverse be lack i think the deck size for construct be a bit too high so its difficult to have a consistent deck and also i have be play this game a lot and still be not able to collect enough card to have a tier 1 2 construct deck but i guess that s where the free to play player have to compromise also would love for a well singleplayer campain but that should be come soon 8 10 could be a 9 10 with well singleplayer support,pos
3073,realm of the mad god rotmg be an incredibly addicting game which feature perma death whilst many dislike lose everything upon death it be also a very rewarding game when you start up it be quite difficult but the more you play the well you get you eventually learn tactic and figure out the good course of action for you and your character it be important to focus both long term and short term as anything could happen at any give time be reckless be one of the main reason why people lose character so it be important to always stay calm do not let your greed for loot get in the way of your character safety i personally enjoy rotmg because it allow me to do whatever i want if i want to feed and upgrade my pet i do that if i want to max a knight or a mystic i do that if i want to do dungeon i do that,pos

3078,this be the action rpg we be wait for a spiritual successor to diablo ii path of exile take the formula and put its own spin on it with their own class lore atmosphere and leveling system i think this game take most of the thing that diablo iii do wrong and fix them as well as provide an item system that be while familiar totally different than any other game i have play and it work really well so well that i would dare say it be by far the good in its category when i first try this game i be kind of disappointed that the class choice seem limited however when i actually start play i soon come to realize that you can play any of the class in any way you want dual wielding wand marauder sure range duelist yup there be absolutely no restriction on how you build your character because of the near infinite combination of passive skill point you receive each level on top of that the skill in this game be a lot like the materia system from final fantasy vii only with exponentially more variety it be very in depth and allow for crazy customization of your ability by modify them with certain support gem i can not count the time when i discover a brand new way to build my character just by pick up an interesting new gem i can not fit everything i like about this game into a single review but since it be completely free to play another amazing feature i recommend you get this game as soon as you can and see for yourself,pos

3129,this game have sooooooo much potential it have the versatile feel of old school console game with the new concept of mmorpg interface with online friend and stranger the system be simple the game itself be fast paced there be multiple opportunity to unlock achievement and a nearly bottomless system for weapon and armor my only complaint be that outside of the initial two or three class the only way to unlock further class be to spend real money while the game bill itself as a free to play experience in order to get any real development out of the game content be to spend cash the game also like to drive that home by 1 make the bulk of the achievement revolve around thing that you can only get through cash exchange and 2 frequently drop cool item that be only usable by the pay class into the hand of mundane player while i can recognize the validity and necessity of have game be pay to play i neither think it be fair of a company to present a pay to play game as anything but that and i dislike game that stunt the growth and exploration of the player through monetary contingency as a compromise the game could have an in game mechanic that allow for the gradual accrual of real money much as be see in loadout it be a shame the game be so impact by the requirement of real cash because that really prevent it from become a hugely popular game but even so i rate this a 7 out of 10 check it out but be ready to either break out your wallet or get irritated that the game only let you go so far,pos

3152,i have spend some hour in this game and will not recommend the game to anyone sure there be some pro graphic detail variety customizationbut there be some con that be to heavy to ignore hitbox the hitboxe be kind of a joke you can hit the same point over and over it will not mess up a tank or plane that be kind of bullsh you can empty your complete ammo into the other plane or tank they be still fly drive without any problem you get two or three hit and you be down not all the time but most of it aim you can aim however you want if the rng do not say you hit you will not hit progress progress be so slow and take way too long exclusive some plane or tank be only available for money and this do not make any kind of fun customization and money okay but that with plane tank be a no go it be more like a dlc in a f2p control sure control be in arcade and realistic good but in simulatorbatlle what be the true realistic the plane control be complete mess up i die lot of time in plane fly in circle and could not do anything balance balance in this game be horror some tank and plane be so unbalanced that be kind of joke matchmake some people say there be something like matchmake in my opinion it be more like put some tank together on a map and let us have a look what will happen if you be look for a ww2 game this be a good game for anyone else this game be nothing for you,neg

3154,why this why mobile game on steam i remember play original world of tank couple of year ago i grind so e hard to get well tier tank match take so long and you be get so little experience and credit i finally manage to get to tier 5 american m4 sherman iirc only to realize how much that tank suck and then i see how much more grinding be before me in a bad tank to get anything well thank but no wot be awful then i play the mobile version on my phone and have many more tank in short time also grab free tank slot on promo so i be not that limit this game look rather bad be dumbe down but it be at least a bit more reasonable in grind fest it could be well but it be still fun especially that you can play on mobile and have same account game still require a lot of grinding though,pos
3155,current state if you can get pass the performance issue it be a great game i still would not recommend it until they fix that side2016 update i want to write a full breakdown of change between the last 2 year but i do not have enough space so i will go fast on each point 1 desync fixed2 performance still sucks3 the last expansion be release too early full of bugs4 challenge can be complete with less farming and get improved5 trading get improve a bit but idd still love a self find league6 balance powercreep be of the chart expect change in next league7 no one care about pvp so they be not go to focus on it anymore not surprised here original review first thing i should mention be that this review do not takle what path of exile do best but what a release game should be and should not 1 desync there be no need argue about it be presence in game we know it be in the game on a daily presence and that it will affect your gameplay skill that will make you desync flicker strike cyclone since you move when you use these skill usage of shift to stop you from move on server client side will not help gameplay that will make you desync even though it be present overall in the game the most desync part of the game be dominus fight especially his first part if you try to kite and move behind cover you will desync at least once per fight it will not kill you in 90 of the case but nevertheless be still annoying as hell desync be responsable for many hardcore death every day server side problem combine with desync last time this happen 4 6 player die from a hardcore party one of them be level 90 2 performance depend on your playstyle if you play alone in town eternal laboratory or any other empty place i manage to get 170 fps when you start play the game it will go to 60 70 if you be do a end game map with some special mod it will drop to 30 50 if you play in a party the performance will be low because there be more stuff go on but some time it will go to 1 when certain skill be use death animation will make you drop fps if you kill large pack of monster range attack and spell discharge lightning arrow fireball freeze pulse ice spear poison arrow will lower your framerate but only in end game or when use in a combination with cast on crit the game will just not work properly if you have a creative sound card cpu bind change your graphic option will not make a big difference in fps gain or loss during fight even if you have 1 fps the game will not use more than 30 40 of your graphic card depend on how powerfull it be 3 bug yes we know that every game have bug but in a end game focus on map drop you should work on fix them first monster stick behind wall and can not be reach this happen a lot on shipyard map level 77 top tier map 1 level below max map level and if you do not kill last 5 10 monster you may just not get a map drop when you do not get any map last few monster have a good chance of drop 1 or even more map you be kick from the server and can not join the map again these happen twice in a almost half year period every patch be plague with game break bug last time they have to roll back because more than 1000 char die on hardcore even the dev will tell you not to play soon after a patch be release especially on hardcore 4 challenge system and how it affect the gameplay and drop since they add the challenge system we see a change on where the unique item require to complete a specific challenge drop you have kaoms heart and shavronne drop only from level 76 map before you could get them by just farm level 66 67 content for a few month the price be also low the only reason they add map only unique item drop be because they have 61 people complete challenge before so they want to lower that number only challenge in get 8 out of 8 challenge complete be get all the unique item to get them all you will need at least 250 exalted orb let us say you be play like 7 hour a day 7 7 day a week even you make 10 exalted orb a week it will take you at least 25 week keep in mind that the first few week you will invest most of your currency in upgrade your gear and progress rather than store it this be not something skill base if you speak about skill it be not even reward in or outside the game chris will go and interview popular streamer instead of skilled even though they be pretty popular in the path of exile scene not even when we have the first player reach level 100 max in path of exile there be a frequent joke make on forum that the only hard part of this game be the magic find slider how much can you get without big drawback 5 trading you hate action house in other game well you will hate this trading system even more there be no proper way to search on forum both forum and trade channel be fill with spam people just stay in town and buy sell both currency or item this be the same problem diablo 3 have where people play the action house instead of the game because it be the good way to get good gear in game 6 balance the new monster hit harder compare to old monster even though they use the same skill a monster make before do 5 the monster do 20 40 moba style of balance change to skill even though it be promise in different interview that there will not be nerf when someone find a cool build that do seem the case and it go as far remove a skill from in game phase run even though it be still on the webpage and a flask which be later add back with a nerfed version at the release 9 unique item be nerfe every new unique item or skill gem have a drawback you can say that unique item have at least 2 drawback now 7 promise for the release we where promise that they will take feedback from player on their forum but the respond more on reddit rather than on the main forum and even with all the feedback they still will do whatever they want make you just waste your time it be not just me say this there be a lot of people that play this game since close beta and have the same opinion private league still wait on news it seem they completly forget about it pvp may be deliver in next patch be promise in the release patch like it be for diablo 3 trading system revamp again push back to god know when act iv push back to march 2014 weekly update now update will be make every 2 week optimization still wait on it clan guild you have a guild tag and a chest that lag every time you put or take something out of it there be actually no reason to have a guild chest unless you want to troll people with the most worthless item you can find in game there be no guild banner or shirt or any customization whatsoever to it custom rogue exile through steam workshop again no news about itat the current state of the game i would not recommend it maybe in 1 2 year it will be well but until then my journey in path of exile,neg

3158,planetside 2 be a great game one of the main reason i play it be because it be one ongoing battle without have to wait for match to start etc when the server be busy it feel fantastic the battle be huge and it be one of the most intense feelign you unlike any other you have come across in game the f2p system be very fair i do not pay a penny until i think i have play it enough to support the dev and just buy a 1 month subscription still every gun i have be buy with cert which be earn with the xp you acquire through gameplay especially in june the dev have release a ton of stuff the community have ask for month just show you that the dev do care about their customer it do take a while to get use to the game and fully comprehend all of the thing within it it but once you do it be an experience like no other,pos

3163,free to pay as much as i would like to love this game because i love the movie i just can not the game fall very short in my opinion for two main reason the first be that at time the control can be frustratingly cumbersome especially during flight sometimes it take a while to register a turn or boost but maybe this be just due to time the second be that you be bombard with advertisement for membership additional perk and boost which i be really not interested in and probably do little to actually enhance the game itself i do not mind a bit of advertising these however be in your face particularly on the loading screen which i like to contain useful in game information such as hint or history there be nothing wrong with micro purchasing in a game it be down to how well it be present that count and unfortunately it seem that a lot of the item or area be unlockable only if you pay thereby limit the actual amount of freedom you do get to explore while you can explore freely to an extent it be pretty linear in that you must follow the path set out for you and play through before you can really move onto the next one good thing about the game be that you can choose between solo and multiplayer but after awhile it become samey and i quickly lose interest sad because it have the potential to be a great game,neg
3164,early access reviewi would like to give an in game review except i could not get in game and when the game do launch the developer have lock charater creation on server to balance player load effectivly cut me off from play with my friend who have already start on the intial server neowiz have have the bad concept of an mmo launch in which i have ever experience launch 1 server at a time until they feel the server can not take it anymore then lock it and create another instead of fix these issue they just continue this proccess a potentinally promising mmo screw by a developer who be aware of the game issue cause it be failure over sea release they choose to ignore the problem and not fix them and cause new problem with how they decide to launch one server at a time,neg
3165,there be nothing much i can say aside from that there be a nude mod for this game and be surprisingly addictive as the title suggest its a clicker and i recommend an auto clicker like gs auto clicker which be free which get you through the zone quicker however high zone will slow you down even with an auto clicker my other recommendation be once you buy one or a few helper with some level then you must save and exit and wait about one week which help with grinding and then you can rinse and repeat alternatively you can wait longer if you do not plan on come back to this game frequently also there be a nude mod which make dlc kinda pointless but to each their own,pos
3166,highly t game every ai just magically have a card to over your entire side of the board rng in this game be immensely against you every turn no matter what card you put down the enemy ai will destroy it good luck win multiplayer be dead barely 1k people play this game with good reason i could not recommend this game to anyone not a fair game at all,neg
3167,early access reviewmy how far this game have fall i have be into this game since pretty damn near the beginning back then it be a sense of adventure to rank up through the tier and level both of which be very hard to increase so the challenge be there that sense of yeah i build that when you finally make that perfect bot be also brilliant those day be long since past the tiering system be go entirely and it be so easy to level up that when i start the game after it be first change i jump from 55 to 100 instantly and i hear you could jump from even further back than that the game menu be so clunky now and they be hard to navigate i still do not know what many of my button mapping actually do on the menu but they do something the colouring system be a neat idea though it be just a consolation prize for lose the tiering system but you have to be premium to actually have creativity with the colour which be just marvelous oh no more tech point there go the fun in unlock thing too the community robot factory while well intend be just a plagiarism facility at bad and at good utterly annihilate that thrill of finally complete a robot which you build yourself also how much be these weapon ten million rp for a single top power weapon get stuff i as not payin that i only get like 50 100k per battle medic bot have be render obsolete as have any form of stategy in the game and the building by the auto heal feature if you do actually take damage you can hide behind a corner and get all your health back what a load of and the pilot seat be remove so no need to worry about protect the weak spot now i really miss the old boss battle megabot challenge couple of strong bot against a full team of weak one that be actually really fun and it be balance too guess they decide it give the veteran player too much enjoyment and they do not want noobs rage quit after one of these fight so it be go now bad of all the game crash a lot more than it use to which really piss me off as if you be in the middle of a battle see ya no reward for you we just wanna waste your time bye i swear the amount of time i hear a player have disconnect in one match be frightening just before i crash myself i remember the day when i use to enjoy this game but now it be both too complex and too simple at once complex in the sense that all those cube variation inner slope edge slope what what be these for at least they refund all those new garage payment i make so now i have thousand upon thousand of free gc so there be that at least update time so they change the mechanic again by change price so they be a bit cheap fine that be alright it be a good start what be not so good be that they lower the maximum reward whilst raise the minimum one so now you earn roughly the same amount of rp whether you be complete crap or absolutely amazing to quote our intent be to help boost the rp income of below average skilled player so they feel they could make progress regardless and to lower the bonus obtain for do exceptionally well to something far more reasonable so now what now there be zero incentive to actually put effort in to get good at the game because you still get a decent amount of rp just for participation this just downright insult those who have take the time to learn and master the game by restrict the value of their skill and patronize the weak and make it so that they do not have to actually master the game at all add this factor to the appalling matchmaking and you get a complete and utter mess of a competitive game if you do exceptionally well at something you expect to be reward for it if you be bad you be deprive of that reward so you have incentive to get well so you will earn that reward but no everyone get similar amount now it be as if the dev want to be modern day robin hood or those feminist try to sort out the mythical wage gap that no one can prove exist there be a well way to fix the progression issue stop make everything so goddamn expensive even with these price drop most of the top tier weapon be seven million or so anyway so what be the point of all this well at least they try they kill off all of their veteran with this change but they try i know some of you will call this nitpicking but when you see how much of a stupid concept this all be update again ok they revert the reward change i take back all that i say before good to see that the dev be actually listen to the community for once let us see where the future take the game now they still have a bit to fix,neg
3168,where to start i be a huge dtm fan and this game be the only one on the market that actually let me have the experience to drive with muller felix da costa green and all the other but it do more than that it be an actual simulator which make everything way more interesting the track be spot on so be the car this be the racing game i always want and now here it be graphic be great gameplay damn close to the real thing and nothing else to add 10 10 would 49 900 norisring again with the dtm merc,pos

3170,early access reviewits look like minecraft but it have its own particular style the game have its own way of playing and be honestly a little tough the enemy be creative but i find that the fighting them be fairly annoying due to the fact no matter how accurate you be you do not always hit them and they will always hit you when your close there be a ridiculous amount of thing you can use to build and even have its own system where it show you how to build a particular build the teleporter be extremely useful there will be no lose your home with them i really wish they would add a map so i could actually navigate a little well overall its on par with minecraft and be its own game with a ton of addition and difference that seperate it from minecraft of course thing be bind to change so it could go anywhere from here,pos

3183,early access reviewas it say this be an early access review in other word the game will improve over time if you do not wish to play the game when it be incomplete you be not suitable for beta testing or any testing for that matter stay away from this currently incomplete game you have be warn just like every other ae game this have the same concept farm it be extremely grindy like seriously if you hate any form of grinding or too much grinding then stay away as well there be new feature such as craft and now even the pumpkin lord armour be farmable which be a great step forward for non p2p player in other word it be more farmy and less cashy just like how an ae game should be for anyone that complain that the pumpkinlord armour be too hard to farm due to low level join in the dungeon they have cap it and be now much more easy a new area have be release and guess what more farming before anyone start complain that the hard area be too hard it be probably because you be too low level basically a newbie not an insult here i take back my previous statement about level be less important though they be super important because the good armour currently available in game be level 15 if you be new to ae game i really do not recommend this because the story do not flow yes ae game be make in such a way that if you never play any other game make by them the story will feel very weird and rush as a long time player of all their game i can say that their lore be extremely deep for example the plot twist about artix and gravelyn actually make sense if you look back at their past storyline you will actually see why sepulchure backstory be personally my favourite and the way he die t t basically if you want to start on this game play all of its prequel if you wish to just jump into this game without any knowledge of how ae game work you will have a 50 chance of either love it or hate it,pos
3184,i recommend this game to your friend and my friend because of the amazing day and night cycle in the game that really shape place in the game this mmofps have very stunning gameplay and graphic through what i have see and hear through search there be some bug for example when my friend land his aircraft he randomly die if your computer can handle this game i would seriously recommend this game the game do have some downfall as to when your in a massive battle your frame per second go down dramatically like i say i recommend this game to all shooter fan you do need a pretty high end computer and graphic card to get on this game though because of the stunning visual,pos
3185,early access reviewi want to recommend this game because it in its self be a fun game however there be many draw back pro it run automatically well than most free to play game have a lot of potential a counter strike sort of gameplay for those who enjoy that buy gear at the beginning with credit get kill for credit etc very fast pace gameplay and heavily rely on reaction to event this be an opinion for me small map work very well for this game they be no large than a counter strike or call of duty map con no unlocking or loot system only item in game be cosmetic buy with real money nothing expensive most item be 1 or 2 but the point still stand game disconnect from match 75 of the time force the user to loose all credit towards their next rank they gain that match very unbalanced certain gun rule the game and other be useless the spa 12 shotgun be one of if not the good gun and you can buy it with the credit you get when you start the match also many gun be over power under powered bad aim too good aim etc the shotgun can only hit up to about 5 yard and if its not point blank then its 1 damage the pistol have no recoil give those who be good with them or hacker more on that later a very easy chance the assault rifle be crap bad recoil large cone of fire damage regard range be bad aks give more damage at 10 yard than an m4 carbine clipping error the model and entity clip into eachother often headshot this one sound like a pro but its not the head hitboxe on a player be massive make nearly every shot you take a headshot and an instant kill lag i know you would think a game thaat do not require much of a computer and only a 200 mb download would not lag much but it seem you be wrong certain gun when fire cause small lag spike as if the audio animation and effect have never be precache or load at all then shoot them again cause the same lag like its loading it brand new again cause the fast pace gameplay to be choppy and ultimately make you loose hacker good lord the hacker it be mostly small child aimbotte with the starting pistol normally that would be fine but consider 2 of the other con mention that pistol be a 1 hit kill when its a headshot even if you have the max armor upgrasde which double your health and the head hitboxe be enormous that be say they instantly kil you this game need an anti cheat badlyall in all i would probably say a 5 10 with ton of room for improvement and a lot of potentional if the dev fix those con and bug and implement a work anti cheat of some sort this be none of right now then i can see my review change to positive and my time spend play this game go up drastically maybe even buy some item from the ingame store,neg

3187,over the last year since gaikin add the italian tree the quality of the game be be deteriorate personally i think the dev be just try to milk the game as much as possible before it die do not play this for the plane mode since the developer only care about the tank mode the plane mode be stale and unbalanced even though the tank mode get 98 of the developer attenion it too be unbalanced with a large percentage of ammo type be infinitely inferior to other plane mode have the same issue but way bad any vehicle with a rating of 3 3 be not worth grind for and play in the current state of the game american plane be the only one worth play in the current state of the game tank with h e a t be the only one worth play in the current state of the game you will always become poor in the free currency this be because it be very hard to be profitable when play against people who have be play since the start of the game these player have memorise every vehicle weakness and as a casual player you will constantly get meme on if you still wish to play the game here be some tip for fly plane in realistic modeclimb at the start of the match climb climb to 500 m to 1 5k high than your optimal altitude check stat card learn learn what you nation do best for example america go fast japan turn russia isngreat at low altitude play to those strength switch you info to metric everyone else use it for tank combat turn on the low graphic seyting possible it make it easy to spot the enemy upgrade the range finder skill and bind it to a key,neg

3191,early access reviewi currently have 37h in this game and it be kinda stress me out sometimes but it be fun have play a ton of other card game before i feel like this game balancing be really not on point there be just a ton of situation where you or your opponent can do absolutely nothing the legendarie in this game be crazily strong compare to other card game but what i really do not like be the mana system it be kinda like magic the gathering the irl card game i do not know how if the video game s be the same you have to play so call power card to gain mana to be able to play actual card this mean that alot of time get a hand full of these power card and nothing to play or the other way around and just lose atleast one third of the deck have to be power card so for example sometimes you draw like 10 power card in a row with the minimum decksize of 75 in short if you think hearthstone be a rng heavy game the luck of the draw that you need in this game be insane in comparison but if you want to get into this game it be not that hard to craft your first deck because you can farm the pve mode pretty easily if you have a bit of experiene the game have pretty interesting mechanic though that need some time to get into which enable some completely overpowered combo that just instantly win you the game overall i have to say that i have fun play this game but i recommend something else until they rework some stuff edit i just get access to magic the gathering arena and have to say that both game play very similar with their mechanic do not remember it that way also you can get a bunch of free pack with twitch prime for eternal if you be interested,neg

3217,i do not know if clicker heroes be the first game of that kind but it certainly be my first so i consider it as it and compare all the other game to it if there be one thing do right there beside the many thing be that it feel honest to you you never feel cheat on because everythings mathematically correct sakura clicker feel like a rushed game because of many reason but the progress be certainly one of the bad you feel like the developer just try something to see how it go without put much thinking into it most of the game be a copy paste of clicker hero ascension include but with all of the functional change do wrong this end up in upgrade cost be too high for the damage deal so the only good thing to do be to upgrade each ally 3 to 5 time then wait to buy the next one and that wait mean close the game and come back later i know that happen to clicker hero too but here i mean literally play 2 minute then idle for 5 hour or more all the time since the aug 3rd update this situation get well because the dev raise the damage a great lot but that also prove the fact that this whole thing be just badly plan at the beginning and it still do not feel right this game suffer from many problem and even though the dev seem to listen to the player and actually implement stuff that most people be ask that could have be do before release it and anyway we be far from something work right it all feel like a cardboard game with little to no animation the only one be the enemy close their eye when beat just a few 8 bit like sound effect and a short looping music that will get annoy very soon the character design be nice but it be just an excuse to attract people because that be really the only good thing of this game that say those girl be just random and there do not seem to be any pattern in their dress boss be just the same girl but strong your character be show on the playfield and you can change its appearance in a specific tab of the game most stuff have to be purchase with real world money before be able to wear it like the most sexy dress and that be the only thing you can purchase the problem be that it just stand there do nothing so it do not really make sense to even be there this game really feel like a quick cash grab as there be nothing interesting to do while it run beside purchasing upgrade which as i say be not really anything strategical since you just purchase the good ally and forget about the rest so for most of the time you will just have the game close collect money for you the progress be non existant as you can not really see any beside the small number indicate the level because the game be always the same random girl with a new random background every 10 level the bad thing about this game though be that you do not know where you be go on clicker hero you always have a clear objective which be not only to get further than your last ascension but it also give you some clear short mid long range objective to achieve and a little bonus if you manage to complete them which be the in game achievement you have a reason to go further and a clear objective and you also see an ending point to reach in this game you do not have any you just beat these always the same enemy for no reason at all forever reach further boss have no meaning either as they be simply another randomly dress girl which give you nothing more than some coin as all the other enemy i see it as if this game try to be another clicker with its own identity but this new identity fail to be attractive and do not even work right,neg

3220,if you have any interest in firearm and enjoy take thing apart and put them back together this be the game for you it have a weird charm along the line of euro truck simulator 2 where you be not really sure why you be still play it but 3 hour later you have unlock new model and be feverishly try to learn the quick way to break down the late one it be a nice diversion that never feel like you have to pay money to advance and it maintain a decent challenge through the different style of disassembly reassembly,pos

3224,early access reviewthis be one of my favorite game i have decide to recently redownload it and find it have go the way of too many game the free to play coverup instead of get expierence from battle and then be able to trasnfer it into more part you get basic part and if you want anything else you be just straight out of luck i do not recommend this game in its current state,neg
3225,1 the meta have not reach pendulum and the other thing lul the only reason why there be no auto win deck 2 fast pace no mp 2 be a bit strange but acceptable since we get fast pace match also 4000 lp make it even well 3 turn very simple turn base system love it 4 activation spell effect this be the main problem other will know what kind of spell trap we set since there be a bit delay when the enemy make an action the system will ask you if you want to active your trap etc5 f2p friendly at least they give free gem aside those pay2w structure deck,pos
3226,fractured space be a game of giant spaceship stately and graceful motion and ruthlessly low ttk couple with strategic and defensive play that can go on for 30 m or more it be a remarkable example of how you can take the moba archetype as a starting point and end up at something that not only look totally different and play totally different but actually build on the good part of the genre many review for this game go into the strategic depth they be right the tactical depth they be right or the mechanical level of complexity they be mostly right the game play well for the most part and can easily support thousand of hour of play but i will not say much more on that i would like to point out the community management for fractured space be top notch the community manager know that have a coc and ban people base of it will draw a lot of fire on steam from troll but they have stick to their gun i have never see cms more proactive on ban racist transphobe homophobe and even misogynist it be incredible and you have to know it come at the cost of a lot of ill will from troll collective of steam even the game dev can get punish for bad behavior while it be rare to see them cross the line it have happen and the cms have not hand out special treatment they do this while still be tolerant of the normal outburst and rigorous debate we all expect in competitive gaming community you can disagree with a dev and call them out on it even in game or on the forum and they will listen they may not agree with you or act on what you say but for such a well police community the actual level of debate be very spirited that be something special and rare all on its own and ecg deserve a lot of credit for this it be a real accomplishment all on its own finally fractured space deep gameplay be not mar by monetization mechanic in general ecg know that people want to unlock their content and they collect money for cosmetic modification and booster much like any f2p game but there be no mechanical advantage afford as of 09 2016 from any store option it be a fair game with a lot of depth you can play it know that while enemy may be well than you or more coordinated than you they still have the same tool in their toolkit as you do and they have stick to their gun on that stance even though it have cause a lot of short term problem for them,pos

3229,early access reviewupdate 1 year and 125 hour of gameplay later and this game have rise to my all time favorite list matchmaking now take significantly less time to find a round thank to a slowly but noticably expand player base new and awesome ship be be add on a very regular basis by the dev every month or so visual be even more beautiful and powerful than before a lot of recent review be rip on the new crew drop system but it be really not that bad it be just heavily focused on grinding but the dev be active and listen so i would not be surprised if we see suble tweak to this system in the come month i would like to also comment on a complaint i have hear a lot no this game be not pay to win lot of people be complain that the platinum currency be pay to win but all it be use for be exclusive ship skin that only change aesthetic now that this game have enter free to play you can pick it up and eventually own every ship and weapon available without spend a dime though you myself and most other have a significant grind to look forward to before such a goal can be achieve challenge accept now go play fractured space original review below only have the chance to play one round so far but from what i can tell i be really go to like this game there be definitely an initial learning curve since i do not get a single kill in that round and my team lose terribly but that be the most fun i have ever have lose the ship texture be beautiful the weapon be tacticle diverse and just awesome i would definitely recommend watch some youtube tutorial before jump straight into a game otherwise you may be a bit lost as there be no start tutorial at this time though dev say they be work on it my only complaint be some pretty severe albeit intermittent lag spike i have a network meter on my 2nd monitor and when my ship would freeze i would see the network connection tank would last about 5 10 second then when it regain connection my ship would snap across the map to where it have aparently be go die a couple time because of that not a problem with my network btw it handle all other online game include bf4 flawlessly i be hope that sort itself out through development or that i be just play on a bad server all in all this be a really fun game the sort of game i have be look for for a long time it be like battleship meet league of legends meet starwars i be really excited to see how this game progress as the dev work on it i would definitely recommend it,pos
3230,ok so this game in all honesty seem decent i like it i like the weapon and item the fact that there s hundred of zombie near you and it will not lag you out the game overall be solid it just need work what i do not like be the community like always most people kill on sight so its really a scavenge and hide game there s no real suvival wich be also take away by the fact that you can just buy food and water and a ton of other item from get money get from kill zombie for a free game its alright i think they need to allow free server host and a singleplayer offline mode for people who do not have internet that much or have bad connection to server like me but until there s free server host or a singleplayer where i can actually have a survival experience i do not think ill be play it much i be only recommend this to support the game but i will not play it that much so if somewhat desperate for a zombie survival game then this game may entertain you for a bit its free so why not try it,pos

3232,early access reviewi juste to love this game where i could spend time just build bot and see if they work or just make a funny looking bot for the fun of it now with the change to the looting system they add and in the prosses destoye the abillity to get the part you want robitts be a joke from rp if you want to make something now you have to cross your finger that you get what you need and for anyone that like to make new bot and be creative this be a prison of what this game use to be,neg
3233,the basic idea of this game be great the graphic be good the only major problem be that this be not hunt i dot know anyone who go out with a gps helper to track stalk thier own kill this game make you depend on gadget rather than any sort of skill the pay system be not worth it i will be uninstalle in just a few,neg
3234,despite all license buying which i do not mind at all this game be realistic have a good atmoshere its butiful and its a free game so there be obviously go to be micro transaction but i do not buy them but i still like the game and btw all the other review the pepole hwo rote them only have 0 5 h on record so what do they know i recomend to download this game i mean its free so why not,pos
3235,so far i be love this game this be a rogue like style game where if you die you permanently lose your stuff until you regain them by replay another character warn this game be rage worthy and the more and more you get attach to your character the high chance that you can die love this game btw lol,pos
3236,early access reviewi buy this game thank to the sale want to understand why bless online be so hated and if it deserve it and yes it deserve it bad engine bad graphic bad optimization orrible animation no trace of action combat system and press very fast 1 r r r be not action and there be no dodge ui be some of the worst ever see auto run be bug and its pathfinding be very very unefficent a nice character customization npc be all edgy and bad charaterize story be without any trace of commitment by the developer combo system be a lie not a very combo system just a short action bar and more spell come out when you cast one of yours from your mini action bar thank to the combo system you can not have all the cooldowns within reach and skill system be not hard but it be unnecessarily complicated in pvp it be a competition to whom press faster his 1 r r combo the only credit that i can give to bless online be that now i can consider even metin2 a very good mmorpg,neg
3237,this game be aight when it have domination but the game have piece ofyoutuber like easter spoiler dukesloth ozzaworld punk duck many more it get bad so i will give it a broken youtubebtw if you be read this duke ozza punk just know i love you but that easter spoiler guy,pos
3238,i think it be a fun game unlike most free to play game this game do not feel like you be limit with a paywall and that i can not beat this level or game without pay also all the cash shop really do be sell costume and mount while yes the mount can be use in combat they be not overpower in any sense i have not pay for anything in this game and i find it to be a fun sidescrolling beat em up on the other hand the game can be a little repetitive for some item but overall it be fun,pos
3239,1 it may be free but the developer really want you to purchase from the store there be no need to purchase anything if you like wait for a very long time later on in your vault if you actually want your store to entice purchase remove the way to speed up the time by change the clock it would make me hate your game more than now 2 some of the achievement though not many care about them shoehorn you into purchase lunch box to have a chance to receive a legendary character because achievement be part of the game i choose to rate it 3 quest be the bad part of this game they have extremely long wait time until you can actually do them the location be very repeatable and the enemy seem so stack as to prolong your time in the boring quest 99 of speech option do not change the outcome when in dialogue with an npc make them seem unimportant only upside of these be the fact that they be partly non linear you can make it to the end quickly or accidentally go the wrong way but your character will hint that anyways 4 the balancing for radiation need to be look at it be very easy to run your resource on a quest or in a vault because of radiation even with a full vault of maxe out character and level 17 endurance and room good weapon and armor deathclaw and radscorpion seem extremely unfair deathclaw seem to rip through any health your dweller have while radscorpion will rip through health and irradiate them make you waste double the resource and waste time micromanage the vault,neg

3244,despite be my favorite game of the past year i still have to agree that planetside 2 have one of the most difficult learning curve to pass in a game for new player interested in try out this game i recommend expect to die more than kill initially however the sheer scale of combat make for an amazing display i remember when i first start play i join a battle span several territory huge line of tank be exchange fire as aircraft swoop through the chaos it be an amazing introduction to the game but not an uncommon one ps2 contain some of the most expansive strategic and intense fight i have experience in the fps genre progression through upgrade feel rewarding and there be no pay to win option for those who choose to spend money i personally recommend try to help your team before you start do hilariously insane thing like my outfit do overall there be hundred of way to play the game depend on what class loadout and customization you choose which evolve over time as you earn more item there will be time where you get tired of playing then immediately get back into the game because you have discover a new and effective way to fight conclusively i highly recommend this game to anyone who want an fps that they can enjoy for a very long time tl dr planetside 2 be an mmofps that both capture the massive scale of battle and give option to the micro scale of each individual player,pos

3246,i have over 400 hour into this game and while i enjoy it i hate it at the same time allow me to explain the arpg genre be about get lot of loot kill lot of bad guy and feel like your character be progress into a powerhouse path of exile be the top of the line arpg for customization but it be a trick you see as you progress in the game you do not become strong but rather it seem weak because as you progress the game take your defense away from you force you to stack more and more which result in the feeling that you be fight the developer the game have fire lightning and cold elemental resistance all of which have a default cap of 75 this cap can be raise by specific piece of gear and very few skill tree node now as you progress half way through the story you lose 30 resist yes if you have no armor on at this point you be 30 to all of your resistance mean you take 30 more elemental damage as you beat the campaign and begin the real endgame you lose another 30 elemental resist in this game be immensely important and rare to find on gear especially unique legendary item so to even stand a chance of not be instantly kill against the weak of end game enemy not boss i be talk the stuff you should at this point be 1 shot you need a total of 135 resist to fire cold and lightning on your gear that be not to fight the final boss that be to fight the mob that you want to farm to get the gear to fight the final content thus fight the developer the game have a massive skill tree which look like insane customization but there really be not if you try to take a creative path and build a unique character you must follow certain path to get the defense you need in the form of increase life or energy shield pseudo life or you will die instantly in the end game content this immense defensive need greatly hinder the customization the skill tree would add i love the game potential but at this point fight the dev to even survive be mundane and quite frankily very frustrating if you be not willing to dump immense amount of time and stress into this game do not bother play past the first few act it become a job as oppose to a game i have try to enjoy this game because i love arpg but the defensive battle be simply not fun,neg

3252,some reviewer here have justifiably complain about the need to pay real money to compete in high level pvp play and i be sure that be true although i play pretty much entirely pve i will let you know what i have find in my first few week of play almost nothing in the game can not be gain with enough time and effort there be mechanic that allow you to earn zen which be the in game currency you directly get from cash infusion from your bank account maximize these mechanic will take a great deal of time in and of itself and even once they be maximize a player would need to manage a lot of gameplay to earn the zen need to generate enough zen for an epic mount or companion for disclosure sake i will admit i have put about 60us into the game all in one primary character who be level all the way to 60 and have epic equipment i have 3 other character who be currently level up who have receive absolutely no financial help from the primary character nor have they receive any form of real world financial infusion and this be the important part those character be do absolutely fine in the pve world be a level 20 character with no money invest go to be as powerful as a same level character with 20 or 50 dollar in it no that do not mean the zero dollar character be unable to handle the foe he she meet in the pve game some hint if you want to play on the cheap 1 you can start use profession at level 10 or 11 use them in particular the leadership profession the leadership profession allow you to generate astral diamond the in game currency which can be convert to zen at a fairly good rate all the craft profession have at high level the ability to create item which can be auction for significant amount of astral diamond as well moreover the profession can easily be manage even when you be not play the game through a web browser check in a few time a day and progress your profession and the level should build relatively quickly hint 2 lockbox be for sucker sure they be one of the way to get an epic mount companion right now but they cost more in astral diamond than they generate on average key cost 125 or 112 5 if you buy ten at a time zen 1 25 or 1 13 usd to open them and usually only generate enough astral diamond to buy back between 60 90 of that hint 3 do not sink large quantity of ad into improve enchantment the cost power ratio you get decrease with each level of enchantment hint 4 epic mount be not really necessary nice sure need not for pve hint 5 sword coast adventure you can get epic companion with this online function hint 6 the foundry if you be creative you can generate adventure which can earn you epic mount companion and hint 7 try to get by with the good equipment you find in your adventure and use the auction house only when you really need something that be not for sale for silver gold every few level you will find equipment better than you could have possibly use before so save the ad for upgrade your companion mount and to perhaps buy an epic set of equipment for reference you need 1 550 000 ad to go from a common free companion up to an epic one through promotion or 1 250 000 to go from uncommon also relatively easy to get with no cash to epic if you have not be hoard them you will find the upgrade very expensive and you will also discover your companion decrease in usefulness when you do not upgrade them upgrade a mount be even more expensive if i would known these hint the 60usd character i have would have cost me maybe 30 and probably could have be do with a disciplined 20,pos

3256,early access reviewi get this game because i think it would be a fun little one off crap game to waste a couple minute on i be instead pleasently surprised to find a fairly flesh out combat system and a fun take on the br genre pro fun combat class fun and useful class specific ability fresh take on armor and weapon upgrade use forge mount for movement speed last but not least you turn into a chicken when you go down perhaps the game most interesting way that it set itself apart from other brs be that instead of die flat out even in a solo game you turn into a chicken when your health reach 0 and you get to hop around dip and dodge while your opponent try to end you be chicken life now for the conscon uninspired location on map bland art style control be sometimes clunky the loot system be hot garbage as the game stand as i write this you can open 9 chest in a row and get armor and ability instead of a weapon it can be fairly infuriating this game be in alpha and if the dev continue to improve this game it will find a fair amount of success 9 10 for a free alpha,pos
3257,i do not undertand many of the review for this game yes it be not truly a free to play but to hunt everything in the game and get two new gun to do so there be a 15 dollar bundle come on people pay that much money for agame like counter strike and do not complain plus i love the people who say i run around the map for 20 hour when key word run have you ever run around the wood at full sprint and see an animal hmm gee i wonder why this be my all time favorite game and no joke i pay 15 buck i have i think 130 hour now and still have not have to pay again and even when i do have to renew my membership that s only 10 buck so 25 buck still be not bad when i have pay that for game that i have less than 10 hour in its really a ing amazing game but people do not give it a fair chance and for some reason think hunt animal be like play call of duty sprint around dive to floor spray and pray group of deer cry because noob wreck your my advice would be just go for the 15 dollar bundle and give this game at least a fair shot hell even if you hate the game 15 dollar be not go to kill you thank and enjoy the hunt,pos
3258,early access reviewactual for v buildok i will try to summ up thing would not suggest it to anyone because of atrocious grinding and poor economy imbalance fps and rts part be almost break use to be a good game at closed beta but then dev team go full retard and way too greedy so in generally speak it be p2w at its fine some people may tell you that it be pay to skip grind but its just a half of the truth first of all because if you will try to grind for something decent to be on the same lvl with guy beat you like grind for weapon or badge it will take you day and even month for some stuff just one example to show you the atrociusness of grind as it stand it be now roughly 1706 hour of continuous biking to run through the physical training badge at a rate of roughly 1200 per hour i be sure someone have a more accurate value 71 day specifically bronze be 5 8 hour reasonable silver be 105 hour or 4 5 day that be pretty ridiculous if you buy stuff with gold you can get machinegun or heavy tank instantly enough say some people may say but you still have to grind ribbon to modify your weapon like make an ohk rifle yup but with gold you can boost your progress like x2 or something like that and it still take an f2p player month to get something decent remember my example moreover you have to maintean your weapon and most likely you will go broke with most of weapon but if someone buy gold or premium he will be able to keep his weapon which for example can oneshot people but your gun need 2 shot to kill anyone this pretty sum up the game the game could be good bf clone for poor people but instead of it it try to squeeze all your money like an angry mobster moreover the game have be beta for year and with such atrocious grind and price it be obvious that dev use beta as a lame excuse to avoid responsibility for rts i will just give you this link bareable for free till you reach lvl3 but i would not suggest anyone ever spend even a penny into this one just buy yourself bf or gta v,neg
3259,early access reviewestimate time to go prone 9 minutesestimated time to get a vehicle lol pay moneyestimated time to get that sniper rifle you want lol dedicate your entire life play this game,neg
3260,early access reviewthis game have really funny content for those who like to read what the dev come up with for the interaction with npc there be also a lot of room for growth and for an open beta it have enough content to keep you busy for a while overall the community be pretty friendly and willing to help when you ask politely i look forward to see how this game will develop overtime and come out of beta i be especially excited for the new class that the dev will include i would recommend this game for player that have play other aq game before aq really take a giant leap with make this a cross platform game,pos
3261,7 0 be the bad update ever make to a game all version before this be like a piece of art the game use to be ingenious require real skill and understanding of how different role between carry and support accomplish victory now the game be a cartoony arcade the hud be horrible the color of the game be too vibrant almost cartoonish the flow be too fast it be essentially an arcade game for kid i could get use to new change but when you mess the interface that much and i have to squint to see everything and i get a headache after not go to happen rip dota thank valve,neg
3262,early access reviewbetter than be boredimo need much more spell that can interact a k a removal and control spell especially in the starter poolalso have trouble find see card draw also the color pie be all over the place red be still red burn and explode blue be a some kind of stall as in spray water and ice in your face green be the color of protect your stuff i think topaz be some obscure jack of all trade mess with a slight focus on stall and big monster nvm it be super op black be i think still black it have a few sacrifice trigger and some removal spell so far huuuuuuuuge note after some more playing topaz look to be objectively the strong color why it can gain life alot of life gain buff gain those life gain massive buff from play mana card aka power card which normally would be dead draw for other deck late game they can draw card and they have acce to both many small creature and extremely large creature on top of this they can remove ability and bounce back to hand your creature topaz only lack actual removal but that do not matter as other color their creature be weak and their ability get removedand they lack speed which do not matter because lifegain and more lifegainit also lack deal with weapon and equipable but that also do not matter because equipable and weapon be a tiny and weak mechanic and topaz just put out creature so big your 6 6 weapon barely matter anywaysnow i have think about the option that the game be like ey jevry you keep play buffy token huh well screw you here be your cryptonite for a second but then think twice and realise topaz simply have too many power and acce to stuff why be this a problem this be a problem because it ensure consistensy for toppaz i could imitate the effect by combine all other 4 color into one deck but that mean i need mana of each type and while i struggle get stick with manatype a and c and cardtype b and dtopaaz can just play all the card it want whenever it want which stack even more upon the problem i would say move lifegain to the justice color as that actually make sense atm this however be just bs,neg
3263,edit 16 07 17once we put in enough time we be able to set up a squad where most of us could play together again it be purely trial and error that get us there and be not explain in any detail we could find in the game if play solo the game be still exceptional in a pair its even better try to play with 3 or more people together get very tricky though as you need to spend squad point on either make your squad large a big group of friend or to add auxillery slot which be the slot that give you the option to change from an infantryman to a sniper or tanker etc etc mid battle its a case of either make your squad big enough to have all of your friend together but have no aux seat no variety or keep the aux seat ability to change role ingame but not be able to create a group big enough for all of your friend the old system be well imo if you have a sniper and the battle have sniper resource you could just switch to it then to pilot then tanker whatever the map have you could spawn as provide you own the type you want to switch to currently you need to setup your option before the battle start which lock you and your squadmate to just those soldier type as a consequence i barely ever us my pilot or para now as i do not like to give up my sniper tanker infantry slot original review smell the update rage lol love the game right up to the late squad update devyatayev have 566 9 hour on record and i love it right up until they break it with too many big change too suddenly with little explaination on how they work exactly what they have change and what they be try to encourage us to do with those change feel similar to how i feel go from windows 7 to window 8 if you know what i mean would love to roll back to the previous version where the game make sense do not force you to play only one role in a give battle and do not insist you take order from the random squad leader the game just pair you with previously you could begin as a paratrooper and drop in on a base for a cheeky capture switch to a pilot to protect the para plane and bomb the tank change to sniper to pick off some baddie then over to tanker to hold the bridge etc all in one match now you can not do any of that until you level up new badge by follow squad order give to you by someone you do not know and very frequently do not have a clue which order to give and even once you have the badge you can maybe attach a single infantryman to your tank squad but if play with friend only one of you can switch to infantry at a time it just remove all the versitility from the game and as i have at least one of each unit type i kinda enjoy be able to change to what be need at any give moment as it make me feel like i could affect the outcome of the battle rather than be stick as a whatever i turn up as would be a 5 star review 2 week ago now its a big fat 1 and that s be pretty generous just to give a bit of background there be 5 of us irl friend who all play together and since the update its not be possible for us all to play together in the same battle because of the new squad limitation its just break or they have not explain the change very well and i be completely in the dark about what i be miss,neg

3271,one of those day out there in the wasteland where you question why you take on survival mode one deathclaw too many that glow one that resurrect his friend and nearly kill you enough from hubology or the child of atom radiate you time to play this overly joyable overseer in control of a vault full of happy people a well live undergrond it be a well make management game with enough fallout element to bring even the newbie to the franchise no matter what vault number you choose it be clear what kind of experiment vault tec be run at your place make sure everybody be happy so happy they be happy than before the great war ps there be no need to micropay into this game if you want that kind of experience just buy a fallout game,pos
3272,aside from the baphomet symbol and sun symbol on the dice ad the game be pretty much pay2win where you fork over money to buy dice that give you great chance to roll those win number in which case multiplayer session will be brutal even those session where you choose no gadget do not mean they will not be use the special dice plenty of time i be so close to win only to be devasate at the last few moment of gameplay just garbage with satanic overture when you run out of token no way to play anymore session unless you fork over money or wait till the next day for a lucky handout if anything at all,neg

3276,early access reviewthis game be pretty much super smash bros i do not have to explain anything except it do not smash bros map or character besides that this game be really fun i do not need to explain it cause it be pretty much like super smash bros all you to need to know be it be fun as hell not laggy no bug glitch and it be free i would recommend this game very much since it be free and it be like super smash bros i hope you like this review,pos
3277,better not to start as you will not be able to quit none of my friend understand why this game be open in my account almost constantly and it be not possible to explain with mere word if you be a perfectionist and materially obsessed person this game could be bad to you than a night in the casino to an gambling addict,pos
3278,believe it or not i have actually be enjoy this game now hear me out maybe it be because i love the httyd franchise maybe it be because i love have my own dragon to raise maybe it be because puberty treat hiccup well however i find the game to be colourful and frankly a breath of fresh air the graphic be outdated and similar to ps2 graphic it be glitchy and i have lose my dragon several time just walk around however this game have many more glitch before i start play it apparently consider i be able to input my appropriate age and i only crash once what we must keep in mind be this game just come out yesterday understandably who would want to put a glitchy unfinished product on the market cough ubisoft cough but that be the beauty of mmo although sometimes glitchy at first they develop and grow over time with the right support i think this game have a lot of potential and i be willing to stick around for it the cutscene be nothing to ogle at and they play scene from the movie for some of the quest i have do so far call me blind by nostalgia but throw movie scene into a computer game take me back to the old disney pc game of course it show laziness on development part by not create these cutscene themselves but i can still appreciate put scene in from the movie tl dr version i like this game while it have it be flaw i think it have potential 10 10 would have toothless follow my cursor in the lab again,pos
3279,this game be like any other clicker game just as addict too i recommend it because it be the type of game that give a very high spike in that good feel quite often whilst play it and i believe more than just me or the people that have this game already should experience,pos
3280,fun and good value game for fan of a casual fallout experience for those who do not mind a bit of a grind there be still enough role play element to customize their own experience,pos
3281,early access reviewtl dr version there be immense fun to be have as long as you be willing to learn a thing or two prior to play bear in mind this be alpha stage so no proper tutorial be present aside from the community with that say i jump in learn from there it be successful absolutely recommend the title even now in alpha community tend to be more mature and helpful than in your average moba title too load of spaceship available with more to come and current one to be balance further each with their own role in the game dev hold weekly hangout on twitch where they answer question re development of the game which be also quite cool,pos

3284,early access reviewto the people e and compare this to minecraft come on bru before talk smack at least play 5 hour of the game where to start well the building system be one of the good i ve ever see the graphic be pretty good and gathering material be easy as hell not go to lie its a bit hard in the beggining but it get much easy later on,pos
3285,early access reviewit do not work i still have not manage to play not a single time i get three different problems1 every time i try to launch the game it ask me to login but login do not work2 quick game do not work3 the game freeze and i get a pop up window say fatal error freeze detect i have window 10 with the recommend spec so it do not look like my computer be not compatibleto make it bad i be concerned about a strange app the game instal in my pc without my consent it be call gaijin net amd it keep run on the background even after close the game,neg
3286,yes it look like a bad game to play but the plot be really good t have amazing graphic and it be quite enjoyable also grate voice act i be plane on spend some long hard hour on this,pos
3287,grinding be extreme in war thunder and a huge chore for f2p player this force you to go for premium but even then it take way too long to unlock something new unfortunately the matchmaking be break too you be fight against enemy with plane tank one tier higher than your make the grind even more frustrating do not be fool by gaijin,neg
3288,i remember when i first play this game and the new character be the trap then we get 2 more the pvp need a lot of work put inot it becasue i keep gettte match with people that be around level 50 or 45 when i be lv20 and it be not fair this be pretty much the only bad thing i remembe rfrom this game it have an interesting world and some cool character,pos
3289,its a free game obviously and you can always tell it free i do not recommend this game at all because everytime i try to log in there be an error say no server connection i have full internet connection and i can connect to anything else but this so far this game be not impress,neg
3290,great strategy game i have almost 400 hour on it it share similarity with civ 5 mtg and faeria definantly check it out it be free to play in reality if you spend 2 to 5 a month i feel it move thing a little faster not a must,pos
3291,mostly like hearthstone but they bring in an interrupt instant mechanic which slow stuff down immensely and require everyone to always pay attention when it be not their turn avoid that at all cost no matter how difficult it be to keep the game deep be perhaps the genius masterstroke of hearthstone and it be completely baffling that legend would try to turn back the clock on that normally this would not be so much of a dealbreaker but legend be so similar to hearthstone in design that it force comparison and must necessarily beat hearthstone at its own game which it do not,neg
3292,this be a game that require you to smite stuff in the face over and over lot of smite in smite smite this face and you smite that face you smite here and you smite there it be smite,pos
3293,it be fun it get some point but it be a clearly example for an unbalanced game to earn i be not ask for a everything free just take a look at dota 2 it be a true f2p game of course a lot of pp pay thousand dollar for dota 2 but none of them can win the game by pay money i do not get it the mole rat which can use kage bushino jutsu and amaterasu while human which can stand and stare back to those mole rat with the gun in hand the armor on body,neg
3294,early access reviewthe game be so much well when i first play like three year ago now i have a 5 minute ban because of the new beta i bet they rush to get release i could not connect to a damn game because someone keep get disconnected and when we do get disconnected we get a game abondon cool down i literally have the whole thing record from try to join a game to get kick and ban,neg

3296,okayi spend 2 hour enjoy some build simulatorthis be fun actually you can explore and kill some raidersis it good yesis it worth well it depend this be actually worth for me dodge some paymentis it annoying nois it small yes just 200 mb i think,pos
3297,i be really dissappointed in this game i be really hope it would work even after read all the bad review i be still give it the benefit of the doubt the graphic look nice and i the idea of a group vs group and a 100 vs 100 mode seem super fun so i download the game and start customize my character and be have a lot of fun because the customization menu be v detail after make my character i continue to the main basic training part of the game and i just find the instruction so frusterating and difficult the main movement control be fine and easy but the control to fight and use power up be just too annoying for me to try and figure out i think it would have be well if you could just use the right and leave click of your mouse and maybe scroll through the different power up to use in battle i be really root for this game to work for me but it just do not if anyone read this review have tip to make the gameplay more easy and fun please let me know,neg
3298,i love the game i really do and i play it year before i ever switch to use it on steam and that be only about a month ago despite the large number of hour list however i can not recommend it anymore why they have go out of their way to destroy the game especially of late they seem to be actively work to drive away the player and in the last month alone it be work spectacularly in january they have something like 15 000 player through steam now they have something like 3 500 ignore the stuff everyone else be complain about though justified like the lag and disconnect they have recently destroy a player ability to earn astral diamond the primary currency in the game yet do nothing to adjust the price of everything that require them make the only way to get enough of them to even get by be to pay cash and with the rate the player be flee the game you get less and less diamond for the same amount of money give it be a player base exchange similar to what gw2 have without an adequate supply of astral diamond there be basically no character progression at high level i wish i could keep play but not be able to get and stay connected to the game for day at a time with lag that will guarantee many dungeon wipe in a row even with the good of player it be just too frustrating even with all the extra character slot i buy to try to have extra character with which to farm diamond just to try and have enough diamond to support one character it do me no good when the lag make the game virtually unplayable truly disappointing to see such a great game be destroy while the dev turn a blind eye stick their finger in their ear and keep scream i can not hear you the game be perfect i can not hear you we have never make a bad decision ever,neg
3299,get to say it be a pretty good and little adicktive game great for a quick play or long session 1 thing i have notice since use a ultra wide 2560 x 1080 be to try and aviod zoomie out too far and then move the map it tend to freak out and dissappear it will come back when you zoom back in,pos
3300,early access reviewthe ambience be build very well it be hard to take the game seriously at first but i soon learn that be a mistake now i look forward to my jumpscare pal p 10 10 would feel relieved to see stumpy again,pos
3301,okay here we go boy i think lol have ing balance issue lmao boy be i wrong just wait until you lose to a ing fetus who do not stop laugh taunt because he win with anubis in a single lane game mode i guarantee that you will blow your load all over your monitor because of all the pleasure you get from that hi rez should we balance the character so that the people who want to play character they like can win the game as well nah that let just keep add skin for our male character that make edge lord say oh this thanatos skin fit me as a person cause i also like death and the color black and the female character get e stripper cloth so this community of ing virgin can blow their load to the token jail bait in this game aka jing wei i have play hundred of video game in my life and i have never meet a more toxic or entitled ing community and i have play lol csgo gta 5 and ing dota 2 i would rather get a with tooth than get in another lobby of smite of wait that fenrir skin be kinda dope never mind i already buy it,neg
3302,this game seem like a poor platformer compare to other game like smash brother to metroid to even dust it have a dedicated comunity and content still be add on and it cost money i have make it far without pay a dime but there be clear and anoying ploy to get you to spend cash however it be dungeon be interesting but too linear this be not a game about explore and in pvp there be a high skill climb if you be not use to the genre or fail to understand how to get out of a stunlock but there be plenty of guild out there who would be willing to help you learn how to survive the pvp,pos
3303,early access reviewthis game be great for people who want a true f2p experience play around 10 hour now and i have get so many card and booster pack not to mention each booster pack give you a resource that you can use to craft card with as well as 12 card very friendly towards people who want to play against ai as well overall i would definitely recommend this game,pos
3304,great game it can definitely get pretty challenging at time and you need to be strategic with the layout of your vault but the big your vault get the more fun it will be because that be when you can start do more quest train your dweller special stat and craft weapon armor and theme overall a great and addicting game would recommend ps i have see some people complain about the microtransaction but the truth be you do not even need to spend a single penny to have a good vault my vault have 100 dweller and i have not buy anything,pos
3305,recommend this game however a low end pc will not be able to run it at a decent framerate 30fps run it on a laptop i get 30fps low setting so optimization be actually improve they be still work on that bad graphic card in existence terrible processor yet it run my mother computer be bad off yet it run 20fps a while back,pos
3306,do not play this game for any reason its one big cash grab and full of fustration for no reason at all crap match make crap balance sub par graphic lazy dev i use to suggest this game to my friend but honestly this game deserve to die and quickly,neg
3307,wargame why the hell would you put this on steam and not regular wot on a side note it be a great game primarily aim to those who can not run the original game graphic be nice for be a mobile port and there be alot of variation in tank wargame certainly hit the spot on this one my only complain be the yolo it player they most certainly ed alot of the match i take part in fun fast match with good look tank and you can team up with a friend against those bastard what else would you want,pos
3308,i think that i would love the game but the tutorial for learn the aircraft be absolutely horrendous bad tutorial i get fc3 and be try to learn to fly the su 27 1 the guy talk so quietly lot of background noise 2 the text for the guy script have very tiny print 3 the text will disappear and there be no listing of what to do if i do not finish read the text 4 not all of the control be list in the lesson description 5 there should be a whole document in game book describe every detail teach in the lesson that should be available to be read outside of fly the plane in the lesson have large print if you do that 6 i start play the game again on oct 12 and everything be very blue i set up the mission to be very cloudy and have some fog but everything be soooo blue all of the cloudy sky and thick fog be blue like kool aid other idea 1 i wish there be lot more map available in the game and sell cheap i want a map with a massive flat desert and that could be sell at a maximum of 10 or free i do not want map that be base on real place 2 when i press esc i want to have a whole mission restart from the very beginning available right there so i can quickly go back after a mistake 3 female pilot model and voice would be a nice option for those like me who want them in the game,neg
3309,early access reviewi have never play minecraft before but when my wife pick up this game during it be free week i decide i would check it out as well it be absolutely fantastic i play it for about a day and a half before i decide to pay for it and i do not even slightly regret the choice it be still early access and it occasionally show but this game show an extremely high level of polish that i have not see on some game that be even fully release the bug that i have come across be usually small but pretty regularly re creatable however the depth and breadth of the game make them easy to overlook my big problem be with the combat honestly it be almost always a battle of attrition and if you survive you tend to end up with low health at that point it be almost well to just kill yourself somehow and run and get your thing die be basically a part of the game so it be good that there be no real repercussion for do so other than have to go pick up the thing in your bag some creature be absurdly difficult and dodge be almost a complete non factor you can occasionally find a good spot to dance a circle around a creature and not get hit but it be inconsisitent my 2nd large issue be the durability of some item in the game compare to the amount of material require to craft them the mining cell in particular come to mind there be one of two way to solve this as far as i can see either make item with durability like mining cell last a lot longer or make the odd material to make them more readily available i be not say i want my stone mining cell to last me through 18 hour of playtime but i would like to be able to find 5 red flower without run around for 20 minute look at every other tree i find in spite of this the game be immensely fun and you can easily find yourself suck into it dig into your mine deeper craft your house to look absurdly awesome or just explore the surprisingly vast environment you will find yourself readily wonder where the hour have go i would definitely give this game a 9 10 because it be technically not even finish yet you should definitely check it out,pos

3314,early access reviewi love this game it totally scratch the itch that eve leave out dynamic 3d space battle between capital ship that somewhat like lol in a sense what i love about it 1 easy to pick up the game be not hard to understand and provide tutorial as well as a shooting range map for you to test your ship weapon etc 2 graphic enough say 3 developer that actually listen and read player suggestion and comment 4 pace research speed not as demand as wt or wot but not easy enough fo ryou to breeze through the game in no time 5 the game look like its ready to roll out of beta but still have the development support of a alpha game this mean that change will happen and patch update will still be frequent lot of uncharted space to roam through still the down side 1 slightly long wait time for match 2 not much teamwork go on at time but that be on the playerbase and not on the game or its developer note about the mixed review notice most of the negative review be either player who have buy this pre ftp alpha and demand refund or player with few hour on the game i have this on my 2nd account and have 100 hour on it i believe that this be a issue between the consumer and the developer and should not be use as ground to judge the game itself you make the choice to support this game this game take off in a different direction but it should not be surprising that it may go ftp to gain more playerbase,pos
3315,random lazy review sp this game may be inspire heavily by diablo 2 but present a pinnacle of greatness out of itself one hand easy to play isometric hack and slash worldwide standard main storyline mission be decent enough every single game mechanic be perfect to the extreme huge skill tree interesting gem property result in brilliant active skill artistic graphical side and variety of character enemy landscape etc be a sight for sore eyessome of minor issue for me which have no effect on the value fo the game where be the pause button respawne of monster in a particular map whenever you be disconnect or hit esc to get a coffee you have to go through everytime too much unecessary loot little bug drop heavy armour countless of weapon which make no sense a common problem with diablo genre bottomline evil blizzard bad nightmare recommend play it now,pos

3322,early access reviewthis game be in its early stage of development it be an awesome tem base game give this game a chance it will only get well its a game you have to work your way to get ship and equipment there be many different ship to choose from and they be unique in their own way many of the ship be mission dependent if you work as a team you succeed more than individually strategy and tactic be the key to win,pos
3323,i plan to write more review but they will be short enough for all to read but just enough infoa 100 free to play game that have more depth more content and much to do than most game you would shell out money for it be like diablo 3 but dark and a more gritty feel story you be exile and leave in a continent or place call wraeclast you venture out in dungeon cave ruin jungle and other locale in wraeclast gameplay you select various class maurauder melee tank duelist hybrid of melee range ranger archer witch mage templar hybrid and a scion unlock after 1st act so there be a character for just about any play style destroy the many horde of creature in wraeclast to gain experience and level up you get nice loot base on the enemy you kill or quest you complete you get to use special colored component to enhance your weapon and gear and poe boast a massive skill tree that i have ever see in game the skill tree be like an extension to the colored component but you can specifically add point to certain attribute online co op there be some co op play but keep in mind you have to be close in level with other player there be guild to join you can trade some of your gear with other player there be also pvp and often time tournament you can qualify for to make the game challenge con minor gripe be for some not so good netcoding you think your character be at one point on a level but a split millisecond his her position be somewhere else as if he teleport it can get confuse sometimes frustrating when deal with a mob of enemy but it be a minor gripe conclusion if you like diablo game give this a try game have a bit of a learning curve to it but there be plenty of guide and helpful people that can get you start or keep you move on there be plenty to do the game today be completely different from when it be first available most importantly the game be free the only time money would be spend be for purely cosmetic enhancement to your character this be the first game i ever put over 100 hour into on steam and it be worth it,pos
3324,early access reviewthe game have a nice space moba concept really enjoy this game so far it desperately need more map and more targeting option aka target system and such some minor latency issue nothing too serious 5v5 be a nice start but i can see this game be epic with large scale battle as well graphic be on par ship be realisitically design hud minimap need improvement the game do require communication and a good sense of tactic once your mmr have go up a bit base race with my 1 collossus vs 3 of their ship in our base win 100 99 10 10ghost stealth behind asteroid pop out and flank for a fast kill klingon stlye 10 10disperser push ship out of delta cap zone for the buff capture 10 10i hope they add a lot more to this game currently feel like a mode in a big game i believe they can even make a campaign with this engine,pos
3325,it can have some very frustrating down over time but this game continue to show growth and excellent gameplay that i have always want it can be very intimidating with the learning curve and the late part of the game will quickly punish any build not up to snuff because of such i do recommend read build guide that help explain how and why thing work as they do go in completely blind do not always teach a person if they do not know what it be that they be do wrong year in and it be still get massive content update for free to all of the player make it worth support them with a supporter pack and use the point for stash tab to make the gameplay a bit more for us hoarder also help with keep your valuable item and currency in check just make sure to wait for a stash tab sale that they always have at least once a month never buy an item that be not on sale with the mtx store i love the game but the mtx can be very pricey once you convert the price to point ratio and find out that a hat cost you ten dollar good to just buy supporter pack for what they offer to support league you want to promote or set you want to collect and use the leftover point for stash tab and stuff on sale when you think you have enough,pos

3331,the game premise be compelling but you will spend most of your time in this game run through empty room with nothing inside them break up by the occasional monster chase all of which fail to excite past the initial encounter after you discover their gimmick or environmental nudge nudge video game reference the story be a disconnected mishmash of popular horror trope that do not make any kind of last impression on me i be glad i try it but it be definitely not worth play through to the end where i be meet with an unsatisfying conclusion to the story the alternate ending be not much well,neg

3333,early access reviewnice little f2p fps black squad be essentially combat arm without the ridiculous limit on purchase weapon as almost all item in the store be permanent and relatively easily acquire the game reward you with the secondary currency fairly frequently namely after daily challenge level up and daily login reward which allow you to buy the more exclusive weapon in other word some of the more powerful weapon daily login reward do not require you to hop on every day to track so the game do not force you to log on every day to recieve the reward pro great fun for a simple multiplayer fps several game mode many map large selection of weapon to choose from do not force you to spend money to get good gear play fluidly and feel great to play overall most weapon be balance fairly for example the m107 be one shoot one kill but you can not move with it because if you do the bullet will be send into the ceiling or the floor con poor map design be very easy to be spawn camp on certain side of certain map you can not change loadout once you have pick one and spawn slight p2w element though they be not nearly as present as most other game balance can be a little iffy at time some weapon be insanely accurate for instancegive it a go if you want simple multiplayer fps fun i be have an absolute blast with black squad edit you can change loadout after spawn you just need to use f1 f3,pos

3337,wife be away for a few day 45 hour into thehunter in 3 5 day first look tl dr i can only hunt 2 thing unless i get a subscription that noise put some effort into it and click a couple thing that be not how it be for more info read the first section on what be really up the real tl dr it be a hunting sim if you like hunt nature and an experience that directly reward you for the effort you put into it give this a try it be supprisingly addicting fun and reward my impression of the economy in the game and possible solution for you thrifty spender who do not want a subscription this game be not what i would classify as f2p the game you can download for free be basicly a demo that still allow you to interact with other people online and experience a good scope of the game you only have license for mule deer and cottontail rabbit you will not be allow to shoot the bunnehs with the rifle they supply you with though even if you do not invest a single penny into this game though i prolly spend a good 20 hour hunt mule deer with that free rifle alone so why not give it a try you have unlimited ammo for that rifle want to hunt the bunnehs too for one single for all time investment of 5 usd from henceforth all money i list will be in usd for you gbp euro and other user you can get 500em of the game currency you can get a shotgun for 450em while ammo for the shotgun will not be free like the ammo for the rifle you can still get the ammo for free for some time just from play accomplish mission read task will earn you gm which can be spend on various consumable in the game like ammo em be the premium currency you have to buy with money gm be the currency you can earn from complete mission in the game like take down a 6 point buck em can purchase anything while gm can only buy ammo wind indicator scent eliminator consumable as a guest free player you can still visit and explore every map on the game and play with other people however mule deer can only be find on logger point and whiteheart island the cottontail rabbit can be find elsewhere though you can earn em from participate in our sponser activity i gather that be a lot of survey and email you can direct to a junk email account not worth it imo but that option be there if you want to earn premium currency without spend money the wayfarer starter pack be 14 99 it come with various item but most importantly weapon it give you a 3 month license which provide you with licence for all animal in the game and unlimited ammo for all gun it say basic ammo but the only non basic ammo there be be the tracer arrow it also give you a shotgun and a 357 pistol you now have the ability and weapon to hunt everything in the game 15 for 3 month most mmos cost that for a single month it get even well than that it be actually only 9 99 for a 3 month membership that be 3 33 for 30 day that sound pretty cheap to me but i do completely understand not want to pay for it at all so read on for way to work around that do not want to pay for a sub not a problem you can actually buy licence for individual animal for pretty cheap say you can only really play on saturday with your friend you can pick up a 24 hour license for any animal for 45em that be 45 cent if you buy the cheap money pack the large bundle be well value 4 99 for 500 9 69 1000 18 69 2000 26 99 3000 43 99 5000 so say you get 2000 for 18 69 be honest with yourself you have spend more on crappi game it be like the same price as a craptastic meal for you and your sweetie at taco bell you now have 2000em and a 24 hour license be only 45 that be almost a year of saturdays worth of game with your friend you can get a 7 day license for 95 you can even buy license with gm which be the money you can earn in game you can now take your free rifle with unlimited ammo and go hunt other animal my actuall review i think it be a great game i do think it be be market poorly it really be not what i consider a f2p game like they be try to list it as a lot of people include myself see that it be restrict and require money to fully unlock the game and say bs i be out of here read the above it be cheap than most game you prolly play this be a sim this be not doom or any other shooter running be this game will only assure you that you never have a chance to shoot at anything if you even see anything slow and steady win the race or slow be smooth smooth be fast or enter your choice here it be all about the hunt i spend most of my time track and stalk my prey just to line up a single shot they do well to make the tracking not be tedious and there be always the suspense of not really know if your prey be on the other side of the valley or around those tree the envrioment be amaze the tree look and move like tree even the bark look like bark and hold up to close examination the lighting be superb the way the sun filter through the tree and the sunrise be beautiful i have find myself just wander through the massivly large expanse of the map just enjoy the view it be the close you can come to experence nature without get off your lazy rump check some of my screenshot or any of the other people take it be a beautiful game there be character progression it be not an in your face tech tree your ability increase as you play as you track an animal your ability to track that type of animal become great and easy as you fire your weapon you progressivly get well at handle that weapon there be a decent variety of weapon rifle take your pick like the surgical precission accuracy of the 300 the hard hit power of the 9 3x62 anshuitz maybe something vintage like the famous k98 from all your ww2 shooter perhaps even more old school like a 50 caliber muzzle loader there be many to choose from shotgun shotgun your thing dig in extremly versitile with your choice of slug buck or bird shot they let you hunt every animal in the game with a single weapon come in a variety of style for your need pump action over under double barrel single shot or the semi auto 20 gauge to paint the field red with pheasent blood pistol everything from the 22 for varmint hunting to the 357 308 44 up to the 454 rage bull bow yep have them too popular compund bow with high tech auto select range finder sight precision readiness of the crossbow classic styling of the recurve then there be the classic true hunting experience of the longbow all the equipment and supply you can think of and would want for your style of hunt tent blind stand tower bait decoy scent eliminator lure the also have numerous style of camo and outfit for

deer up to the massive red and reindeer even grind locked and airborn bird like turkie and goose the game market be compartmentalize you invest as little or as much as you want into it at 9 99 for 3 month it be one of the cheap subscription around and if you start play less just pick up a small pack of em and only pay for the day you want to play at 13 45 cent per day try it for yourself download the game for free head into logger point and start hunt mule deer the community for the most part be very friendly and willing to help new player learn the game this be suprisingly awesome,pos
3338,fun game i would not exactly call it free because you can get and do so much more if you spend money on this game unlock special character pet weapon the work and it will also benefit you more it can become hard to make a decent amount of cap to upgrade and build new room i love that you can have pet but once again if you do not spend a certain amount of money do not get too excited when it come to have a nice collection of pet the dweller be easy to gather as you can impregnate female dweller with male dweller this will require more food and if you have a large base your energy will run out very quickly unless you play every 5 minute it be also extremely hard to get lunch box but very easy to send a dweller to the wasteland to get more weapon and outfit i like the game i just wish they would make it easy to get more cap and lunch box perhaps throw in a pet carrier when you log in every day for a whole week or so i would definitely recommend this game though i guess they have to earn money somehow updatei just go on my first quest and earn a lunch box i be still a newbie so bear with me day 7 of play this game or something and i earn a lunch box after my 7 day consecutive log in xd,pos

3345,early access reviewoverall this be a really fun free to play shooter with earnable cosmetic weapon also you should not believe these review with 2 hour or less of play time claim there be rampant hacking in this game there be not there be really good player in this game for sure but if you do not play first person shooter go 2 0 22 a game and spray at people foot with an smg at 40 yrd away then you should not assume someone be cheat because they headshotte you 8 10 give it a shot if you be a fan of other shooter and want to try something familiar but with its own charm pro free to play start weapon be plenty viable and you can earn the rest of them fairly quickly map be build in a way so you do not have to roam around forever to find an enemy gunplay feel responsive and rewarding headshot accuracy matter con map be fairly small so this can lead to grenade spam in tdm however grenade themselves do not have ridiculous explosive radius and the further away you be the less damage it will do teambalance can sometimes stack you against really good player while leave you with not so good player to carry,pos

3350,early access reviewi be recommend this game by a friend that really enjoy a number of similar game and i have be love it every since i first try it there be some cool mechanic that i think can only really be do in electronic card game or at the very least would be a pain to manage in paper game and there be not really any randomness unlike what i have experience with other game though you can purchase card with real money i have never feel the need to as the reward system be extremely generous you earn a free pack for your first win daily there be lot of objective that will give you a pack or two upon completion etc lastly it be quick to learn the introductory campaign cover a lot and there be a solid single player puzzle section that allow you to understand the in and out of different mechanic overall i highly recommend this game i enjoy it every time i play and it be really easy to get into with no starting experience,pos
3351,it be hard not to compare this to magic the gathering say that this be actually well than mtg i especially like the system they use for add magika to your pool i have not do any duel against real opponent yet so i may alter my review in the future but for now the single player quest line be very fun i create a green white deck that be name monk i wonder if all green white deck be auto name this and i will say it be extremly effective my only complaint be that i dislike the random event that happen in some chapter thing like be in a bar fight you can get hit with random bottle or in the arena there be random item to help you even though these random occurrence may give it a more elder scroll feel it give it less of a strategy card game feel be that this be a strategy card game i think we have could have do without those the other complaint and i see this come so it be no suprise you can use real money to buy card make this yet another long line of pay to win game out there for this reason i be hesitant on player vs player mode,pos
3352,early access reviewthis game be a clear carbon copy of csgo it play almost exactly the same the way you get weapon be exactly the same and the game be exactly the same the only reason why you should get this game be if you can not afford csgo but i mean how can you not afford csgo it be only 15 i guess if you be a broke then you can get this game but by all other mean get csgo much well time well spend,neg
3353,early access reviewonly play about 4 5 hour and so far i have be enjoy it no i have not really play the 2d version of the game but i do not think it matter for a game that be only 54 mb in file size i think it be worth to download and try it obviously this mean that you should not be expect super high end graphic but i still somewhat like the artstyle the game be kinda grindy as with most mmorpg but that be to be expect the quest system also tie with the craft system in game where material drop by monster in a certain zone will usually also have an npc who will craft gear for you with say drop material alongside give you quest craft item usually will take you between 15 40 min which be reasonable in my opinion for now but i be guess it will increase as you craft higher level item currently the max level be 15 but do not let that number fool you as i have only manage to hit level 6 4 hour into the game i be not sure if it be intend but you be free to change between the various class whenever you want at any level and for the most part gear can be use across all class i start off as a warrior but since change to a mage who hit way harder overall a decent game,pos

3357,if you be new to the game or to steam i do not recommend this game all the player will hate you and report you and also dota will accept their report and penalize you for not be good at the game i have play about 40 hrs i think just to get to know the game and i have be report over 10 time and penalize way too much for it so if you be a new pc player or steam player or a dota player do not get involve with this game i spend countless hour just learn the basic of it only to be ridicule for be not as good as the pro which consist of the childish people who do not understand what its like work for a living and not be able to play all the time,neg

3372,early access reviewif you like magic or other card game with some strategy and depth to them i would highly recommend check this game out this be a genuinely good f2p card game that be worth your attention or at least try and i have be hook since i have find it it be a lot more fair on pricing and hand out card than similar game look at you hearthstone and there be some genuinely cool mechanic that make use of the fact that this be a pc game without just make them all lol random effect such as warcry there be quite a bit of content here include several campaign and roughly 100 puzzle to help you learn and mess with the mechanic in the game plus you can do draft free gauntlet against the computer with interesting boss mechanic and other it may take you a bit of time to make the exact deck you want but it be totally viable without spend money and i think this be a quality enough game to spend a little on anyway as a thank you to the dev for their hard work hope you enjoy,pos
3373,it be a great game at it be core but the repair cost at the high tier begin to become more than the payout force player to either play in low tier or pay real money to get premium allow them to get more of the free currency per game the game seem far too center on be pay to win to leave this review positive,neg

3384,this game hard to recommend to everyone so i will not i will recommend it to people who have weird compulsive disorder and like meticulously take thing apart piece by piece and see how it work because that be all you do in this game and it be awesome and it be free what be not awesome be that you have to invite friend to the game to unlock certain feature and the game really stunt your ability to progress like any other social casual f2p game it be fine because they have to make money somehow on the other hand if you be willing to take apart the same weapon a few time and wait a day inbetween binging session you can easily get enough point to progress without spend a cent can not beat that deal it be great fun if you be super weird and like take stuff apart that be pretty much it just try it it be 90 mbs and free if you do not like it you can try it and be do in like 15 minute,pos

3390,be play this game since 2014 little less than 4 year now take a break during breach and prophecy league as i be play other game i never once doubt that ggg would keep develop a great game and try it back during closed beta i know that they would bring us an arpg bring us the d1 and d2 vibe that d3 fail to bring now sit in 2018 i be glad i stick with this game and support them through buy supporter pack and mtx from the cash shop for new player i believe that the game learn curve have get easy with the ammount of guide from the community and gggs own little tutorial at the beginning of a new character although the curve to get into the game have get easy the challenge of earn currency build a great character and the endgame have not get any easy infact even harder true poe have build that make the game content look like a joke and there will always be a meta but the fun the game bring through run map at endgame or simply level through act 1 10 have not change i have not always play on steam as there be client issue in multiple league so my hour have not all be on record but i will say i have atleast 3k total hour and count in this game and plan on many more if people be doubt whether the game be truly free to play look at other review go into the game yourself or even just watch video the game be truly free it bring no advantage to those who support the cash shop be strictly cosmetic and convenience what i do recommend for a player willing to spend money in this game be catch the sale they have weekly and always buy on sale they run multiple stash tab sale and you should only really buy when they be on sale unless you be 1st start out i highly recommend buy 1 currency tab 1 quad tab 1 map tab and 1 premium tab essence divination and fragment tab be pure convenience and really be only for those who truly want a tab for all the small thing if you can not spend 20 on a game you can enjoy for hour at a time and can put down and comeback later and still find new content or continue on standard then you should not be play a f2p game at all to close this wall of text i recommend any new player who enjoy arpg and the d1 and d2 to try this game if you be simply want to cure your itch for lose ark or whatever other new arpg come out in the future poe be a great way to do so if you just simple enjoy arpg and want a fair cash shop crazy build customization and hour of fun then download and start play,pos

3397,product receive for freeit deliver upon what the name imply and often that be all you should expect from a free game that say there be flaw that leave me not to recommend it you can not use your mouse in the menu there be no volume slider the resolution can only be set to wrong and bad and have no manual imput click new game automatically override your previous save without a confirmation mouse drag because the game have an fps cap i be assume that be the reason anyway you can not pause the game or otherwise access the menu during a cutscene you can not move backwards in the menu by press esc alt tabbing leave the game audio on alt tabbing while not have the game pause or in a menu trap your cursor in the center of your screen which can only be resolve by open your task manager and forcefully close the application without your mouse or restart your pc the last be my main concern honestly it be a very minor issue if you know what be go on but it be intrusive and i could imagine it to be quite difficult to deal with if you be not the kind of person who use the task manager frequently or simply do not know how to use shortcut except for alt tab though it could still be trigger by program like skype all in all it feel like a mobile port and a poor one at that the pixelized stylization be alright and overall the game be decent enough but i can not be bother to put up with such an absolute bottom of the barrel ui,neg

3412,early access reviewthis game have go from fun to terrible in such a short space of time initially the game be about build a robot which require you to have some skill and design idea around it you also have to actually aim your gun there be a purchase system where you could purchase extra credit and premium to further on your design or get that weapon you want the most recent update to this game have bring fourth weapon you do not need to aim robot you need no skill to fly and random chance on the block you to actually build your robot but hey you can purchase crate from the pay store to hopefully complete the robot you have plan i would suggest anyone very strongly to think again before spend any real life cash on this game as it will most likely be waste by the developer on awful update if you want to check out the kind of feedback they have go to their game forum,neg

3422,elsword be probably my all time favorite pc game and i have be play it for a little over 3 year now many give it a bad reccomendation because of its claim to be a free to play and say that it be a pay to win i will admit that i have put quite a bit of money into elsword but that be simply because i love the game and have an addiction to the pvp side of it however if you play mostly for dungegon and be not a pvp orient person you can surely get by perfectly fine without pay a dime put money into it be all up to you and your preference either way really good equipment set can be obtain through do secret dungeon and that be always free just a lot of work that some people be not up to so my point be elsword be not 100 pay to win i would totally recommend try the game out,pos

3424,a fairly addictive 2d bullet hell game be prepare to grind a lot but the grinding be far from boring dungeon be randomly generate and can also have treasure room to multiply your loot gain by far my favorite part of the game be the loot system the more damage you do to the boss the more loot you get it inscentivises and reward actively tackle the boss instead of leech though some more difficult boss drop treasure chest that contain the loot the game currently still have a lot of problem leave by the old developer kabam logic instead of fix duping let us just make a lot of the rare item in the game untradable we will ban some people for hack if they be report but not have moderator to actively survey the situation let us make some of the good item in the game available for purchase in the starting area for ten dollar so that new player can see how great we be all in all 10 10 praise deca,pos

3430,early access reviewafter almost 200 hour and achieve the rank of master two season in a row i feel like i can write a proper review for eternal this game be great it be almost disgustingly free to play you will be shower in pack and card when you first begin and get a free card pack on your first rank win a day have keep me return time and time again however if you be look for a cheap alternative to hearthstone you be probably look for shadowverse eternal be not an easy game by any mean the power system be very similar to magic the gathering which can be very off put for anyone who have not play it before i believe draw mana make the game more complex and allow for a wide array of deck than could ever be achieve in a system that give you one mana every turn if the occasional mana flood or mana screw really bother you this just be not go to be the game for you if you have be look for a complex ccg with all the deep mechanic of magic the gathering while also be very generous in how easy it be to collect i can not recommend eternal enough tl dr not great if you be just tired of hearthstone but if you be willing to sit down and learn it be quirk there be a truly complex and interesting card game that be very accomodating of small budget,pos
3431,this game be perfect in many way it be well than minecraft in other it lack some of the technical ability with wiring that addon for mc have but its much pretty a lot more fun and with some cool concept plus the concept of world adventure and server be much better streamline plus there be a well community the people complain in the review about this not be to play but to build for other to play do not get the point of this game but there be a learning curve that take time to adjust to,pos

3433,early access reviewin its current early access alpha stage i think this game be very nice looking and fun obviously it could use balancing and fix and stuff since it be alpha early access but it be fairly good so far very interesting and varied ship design with nice theme base on faction if you be interested in graphic then you may like the fact that the game look very good even on low setting although i will say the station model could use work not that it be much of a problem though since you be usually shoot other ship as for gameplay it be good that there be a somewhat wide variety of ability and strategy base on the ship you use the unlock system do not feel like it take too long although it would be nice if get credit be just a bit faster the premium currency do not over saturate the game either which be a plus they do not shove it down your throat like other game also i may be a tad biased because i get the game for free prop to these guy for the free weekend that let me keep the game 3,pos

3453,a great game with an emphasis on teamwork and knowledge of game mechanic fracture space be a a beautiful game with great visual and sound design it have a very heavy focus on teamwork so be polite cooperate and read your ally and your enemy behaviour be key you will need to learn and fast each ship similar to hero in other moba and moba esk games have be strength weakness and purpose understanding how to play each ship be key most game follow a fairly similar pattern cap mine fight for gamma attack enemy base do not let that fool you though just because the game have a mould do not mean you have to follow it each match will have it be different fight and in each fight you may have to play slighly differently and if you emerge victorious from a fight you do feel a sense of pirde however it be not without it be flaw the first and most important one be balance with so many ship and so many factor to take into account the game could be say to be unbalanced and that would not be wrong it would however be a very narrow view as a player with over 500 hour play spread over around 2 year i have see unbalanced in f and it be do nothing but improve and the dev have do nothing but learn if slowly at time but the game be not perfect when it come to balance dare i say it will never be perfect but which game be the single big issue however be the match maker or mm it use a system call mmr which be base on win victory and defeat to balance match needless to say it be not the good system it be be endlessly debate moan about change tweak and be a constant work in progress if i be you do not get angry about it other will but just try to play the game help other and carry hard the second be to do with ecg themselves have talk to the dev i know they be a great bunch of guy and girl that only want to make the game be fun and enjoyable for everyone they just have a funny way of show it sometimes from random experimental patch suprise launch or lack of communication ecg definitely have their own way of do thing overall fractured space be a great game with fun and varied gameplay but not always balanced and with a wip mm ecg can seem to be a bit random at time but they mean well,pos
3454,do not let steam hour fool you i have be play this since beta on the normal client i literally download this on steam just to throw my two cent in i will just say this if you enjoy other mobas you will most likely enjoy smite that be say the game be undergo a major shift and the developer be jump ship they be go from hi rez example employee name to titan example employee name this be be use to distinguish between the two group of hirez one be project titan and the other be simply hirez you can expect the eventual dropping of the original dev to the new one half of the problem that the game be currently face be due to inconsistency i will explain most player whether they be new or old can tell you that the game be incredibly inconsistent this be that you can queue for a match and if you be lucky enough to get in and not you be unable to be match and be now the high queue which literally reset your queue for another 10 15 minute if you be lucky to get in you will see one of two thing one or multiple people on your team that be exceedingly low level and should not be in your game or one or more enemy that be low level and should not be in your game either way it be simply not enjoyable rofl stomp some poor guy that s a low level when he should not be in your game be not fun for anyone it be not fun for him and it be not fun for me and it actually have a high chance of run new player away match make inconsistency be more often than not the cause for player frustration i have be play since the beta and i be burn out i play literally 10 game in a row and literally have trash player on my team that throw the game i should never be pair with less than 120 that be sloppy match make playing with friend should be fun i have play countless hour with friend and one design flaw remain whomever queue for the game and be the party leader rule the match make i be normally the party leader and we typically get player between 100 160 aside from the low level we get team with and while this be fine we have a few player that be new and have difficulty keep up with player that be 100 so to remedy this we will have our low level player host and queue for match and that s where it become apparent that the match making be literal trash because if he queue the party we go up against player that be his level not mine hirez claim that the match make take the cumulative level of the party and match make rating and queue them with the player close to themselves well we just prove that be so now we be in a game with player under 30 and i be 130 so i have two option i can rofl stomp these low level player or i can hang back and let them experience the game i do not want to throw the game for us but i do not want to be that player that s farm lowbie that be not fun for anyone and i want the player base to keep grow not shrink god class favoritism be rampant you can clearly see which god class be favor more than any of them just by look at the number there be currently 98 god out of those 98 there be 29 mage 20 assassin 18 hunter 14 warrior and 17 guardian mage be the most overpowered and thusly the most play there be mage that be so ridiculous you can not close the gap to actually get to them this can be see with god like ah puch discordia baron nox zeus vulcan etc it be exceedingly rare that mage be bad however there be many god that be simply in a terrible state such as ratatoskr pele artio terra jing wei nike osiris etc part of this issue be that hirez balance god strictly around conquest their main mode the funny thing be most people do not play conquest they play arena and assault to this end the game be unbalanced severely you jump into an assault which be a 5v5 with random god across the board and you fight an ah puch you be basically screw he can keep more pressure on you than most player can get around if your team do not get a mage you be basically screw god like pele be fantastic in conquest she be design to be a jungler and be the current good jungler out that be say on any other mode besides conquest she be utter trash this be part of a major problem for smite balance the game for a mode that most people do not play as admit too by hirez exec do not work it lead to people quit due to frustration when all they want to do be play the damned game and have fun which be what game be suppose to be smite be literally flood with t cosmetic that do nothing but take space in chest to prevent you from actually get the skin you want you have 1 god skins 2 ward skin 3 avatar 4 loading frame 5 pedestal 6 social emote 7 recall skin 8 hud theme 9 loading screen background 10 jump stamp 11 fountain skin 12 level up skin 13 death mark 14 title 15 music theme 16 announcer pack 17 vgs voice packsand you can bet yourthat all of these be fill the the brim with absolute trash that you do not want but be just there as filler for chest hirez be incredibly greedy and literally throw cosmetic in the way to make you spend more gem real world money onyou do not want just so you can maybe get the skin you want i can not prove it but i be certain that chest be rig so you only get the good skin at the end of the chest to put it simply if you pay 200 gem for one chest roll you will most likely get and see as there be mostly 55 item in one chest you be go to be shell out aton of money just to maybe get the skin you want this need to be change the sheer greed of hirez show in literally everything they do these be only a few of the problem there be so many bug and issue in this game it be absolutely insane in it be current state i would not recommend anyone play this unless you be interested in sub par game and shoddy match miserysimulator2018,neg

3462,a lot of people hate the game because gaijin change thing for the bad arcade be increasingly unbalanced with premium plane no one want to do realistic because if they go 2fast4u the wing rip off engine failure ammo problem spin out everything real plane be susceptible to or because germans get 1 shoot by mericans however if you can look past the fact that increase imbalance have cause the game to become more unenjoyable i beg to differ all of these negative review firstly let us start off with my experience i have at least 400 hour log from the game before i join steam i have play for about a year now before steam so i know what i be talk about okay so about the game itself it be a wwii simulation arguably the good damn one out there that be and will be for a number of year mechanic in general be great and you can fine tune your plane and as of june tank to however you want to have them there be a high level of customization in the game than people think you can add decal paint the vehicle after get all upgrade for it which be kinda bs but whatever select what bomb turret bullet you want your plane to use depend on the plane tank etc etc play with friend be very easy just set up a squadron with them after find them in the chat send them a mail add them to your friend list then you be good to go for play together with them another thing be that the combat while steadily become unbalanced from how it be over a year ago be both intense and draw out most of your time will be comprise of fly around actually look for people until you be 500 km away from them ghost shot can be an issue if someone know what they be do and can actually aim without have to use the target system that show up on your screen overall though when you do get into combat it can be intense and very fun and damage on your plane be very noticeable look on my video section for a war thunder intro video there be a lot of shot where my plane s damage be show there be little music in the game if any it be recommend that you just turn on your radio pandora personal playlist mp3 ipod or whatever else you have and jam to your own tune keep sound effect be optional because 3 4 of the time all you will hear be the engine sound the other 1 4 be plane shoot and random radio call that get annoy the enemy have take the base we must get it back at all cost nosherlock overall the game be very enjoyable if you be not superhardcorepvpmustwin just be casual about it enjoy it for what it be and you will have a grand time on it like i do give it a shot and if you do not take it too seriously you will not regret it,pos
3463,i love this game but the dev have no idea what they be do they focus more on aspect that require actual money than balance and fix game break bug such as ping suddenly shoot up to 495 then kick you from the game game also have a very obvious bias towards people who use their money to buy premium vehicle unless you have deep pocket or get very good very fast do not even bother edit i be sure now that gaijin have never see a tank operate nor research how they work avoid this game edit 2 after hit 1000 hour i can confirm this game be not worth the time the sheer laziness by gaijin be really pathetic and i be kinda ashamed i have waste so much time on this hot garbage they try to pass for a game,neg
3464,i be a long time fighter enthusiast and aviation simmer be fly my whole life pretty much and so i be really excited for this combat sim since civilian sim be get repetitive and bore very detailed aircraft offering but the offering they have be mostly age aircraft the su 33 be the new aircraft available at the time of this writing some new aircraft be still in the work but those be still old design like the fa 18 and f 14 but when ask the dev about lead time it get tiresome to hear they be two week away from release for month on end it do have multiplayer capability but i find myself stick more to single player campaign because the community seem to consist of nothing but grumpy vietnam era vet who do not like new fangled electronic gizmo in their plane so it be difficult to relate to the community as a young enthusiast who be interested in more modern aircraft such as the f 22 raptor or su 37 terminator i be also attack personally by the community on social medium group for protest the dev make user purchase update electronic component for their aircraft as a dlc dlc for dlc wtf really rather than release them to owner of the aircraft as an update patch you would think they would make more money by make a well product which would in turn appeal to a wide audience than to try to pump exist user for more money to update their exist purchase thus make user spend more money on what they already own instead of use that money for get new plane module while we be on the subject i will share my thought about the community for a group of mostly old gamer reasonable disscussion quickly devolve to immature name call and personal attack faster than other gaming community group to which i belong not surprisingly however none would accept an equally match duel dogfight in identical plane with identical loadout when challenge to settle the disagreement like real gamer on the battlefield honestly i have never come accross a bunch of gamer so scared to play a game in all my life at least the mechwarrior community encourage player with beef to hash out their difference live stream in game like proper gamer since we touch on the topic of new aircraft earlier i want to comment about that as well the forward think person i be like modern to futuristic style game i ask the dev community about any plan to include new plane into the sim like those mention previously ex f 22 su 37 and the condescension from both be palpable as i be mock for want such rediculously new aircraft when i ask why those plane would not be offer any time soon the reason give be the electronic system aboard those craft be still classified and so we would not be able to accurately model those system that be the reason they still do not offer an f 16 falcon despite its 30 year age because it have nuclear launch capability which be two button out of sight off to the side of the cockpit but yet classified and so they will not model the aircraft frame for player use really due to one system which historically have never be employ still be in classified status rediculous in term of historical accuracy a in term of flight modeling physics a in term of fun playablility c in term of dev community interaction fawkin fail i like all this have to promise but the actuality of the experience overall leave a bitter taste in my mouth since i feel like i be outcaste from the group due to my age before my playing ability be ever even consider in fact i never have a single 1v1 matchup because none of the pilot that i challenge would even try to fight me and i be summarily dismiss as too young to be worthy of their time if only i could sue for age discrimination in a game i would be able to buy the company and make it accessable to everyone rather than just age retire have be pilot i like it enough that i be glad it be in my library for whenever i get the single player simulator fly itch but i be still look forward to ace combat 7 to be my main multi player fighter sim since it will have more aircraft than just those build before i be bear as well as an interesting story development which be something that dcs completely lack actually it do have a few story drive camapaign but only available for purchase if you have already purchase the specific plane for which that campaign be develop again more dlc for your purchase dlc kinda rendundant do not ya think the stock campaign mission include with dcs aircracft be very dry and sterile compare to early ace combat game as a result i just do not find myself caring about which way the war go in dcs but i still wonder whatever happen to yellow 13 from the ace combat 4 story back in 2004 to this day would i recommend this game depend to whom would be my reply i would recommend it to pilot who actually fly the model of aircraft offer and want to re live their glory day or anybody with an interest in historical aircraft flight simming of wwii cold war era i see this appeal to the generation right behind the civil war re enactment group i would not recommentd this game to anyone who do not yet have gray white hair like modern aircraft or be just interested in make new simulation friend the community apperently only grant favorable acceptance to those with aarp membership new aircraft design will only be release upon declassification translate next 50years to never and good luck try to get someone to actually game with you since them old timer only know how to run their mouth abolut how much they hate us millenial but apparently do not know how to work the gun on their plane as for me this be get uninstalle and i be go to go play other stuff until ace combat 7 come out next year this game could have have potential if not for the unwillingness on the part of the dev to sacrifice real world accuracy for fun playability and the crap community of age player that only serve to suck all of the youthful enthusiasm out of my passion for fly,neg
3465,game amazing some of the objective be annoying with the enemy for them scale with your samage over the level it be on and whilst i would change that the overall gameplay mean that after a certain point you really only need to do a general check up for it 10 10,pos
3466,trove be a good game but it have it be draw back many of which can be blame on two thing 1 some severe lag issue for some people i hear the game do not even start i have not yet encounter that myself and it run fine for the most part for me but there be moment where thing just kinda break then again try play a game that do not have a glitch of some kind 2 pay2win now this i can understand i have see the market place and it be very restrictive on what you can get without pour dollar into this game however like warframe i know of all game why draw comparison to that one hang with me pls you can do just fine without spend a dime of course it will take a helluva lot more time to do but maybe it be worth it despite that i do reccomend this game because of 3 thing 1 friendly it be a very nice game in every way it be warm all nearby player get the loot that drop and there be no fierce competition over that shadow lvl 3 staff death be not overly punishing and the game give you a pretty good start and then encourage you to engage with the community 2 reward cooperation you get more together when you be fight with a team all of you get xp and all of you get loot even better the punishment of death can be lessen when you have a team that can revive building become easy and high level character can provide gear to less level to help them gain rank 3 appeal to a very large audience everyone young old builder adventurer people who like pretty place and people who like hell everyone will have a place in trove there be many different class for people of many different playstyle and each one can be tailor via the gear you get and the gem system threre be club for the different type of people those who like adventuring will be greet very well by adventure club builder can show off there talent to eachother at build club and so on and the good part be that everyone progress through their respective intrest in similar way result in a place where different interest collide and then be sew together in a rather lovely way there be no way i could put this on the 1 to 10 scale and be accurate so i will give it a 89 100 do the math people,pos
3467,i love the realism of this game however i do not like the price at almost 1800 for all of the dlc average 90 per plane 10 per campaign which you have to have the plane for say campaign purchase and the list go on the price tag be ridiculous,pos
3468,be play this game for a few good hour try to unlock every recipe and build cool stuff after unlock everything and hit the wall of premium that have no use in thig game everything start to feel like dead and out of interest the game feel like a copy out of minecraft with a nice resourcepack and with sofisticated complex crafting that give this game a big plus at the same time a minus also if you really want to create thing make you miss the creative mode from minecraft the creature in the game be to damn easy to kill and feel lifele compare to minecraft they tend to bug make them easy to kill run in circle around them while slash i love the idea of portal wow that be cool feature give a different angle to adventure the hand that suck everything out of anything it be well then the medieval pickaxe shovel axe hand i would probably have more to say but its late and lose my idea but i will say this this game its just an improvement of minecraft that do not mean it have anything to do with it while it have many bug and exploit available the game be fun but due to its complex nature it make it abit boring after a while especially when you want to do it in scale but thank you extractor bomb excavator now we only need x ray not really but after you unlock and do everything the game feel like finish a game in story mode and that s it compare to minecraft where even if it get bore at least you can find something to do but this be just my opinion the mechanical part and decoration keep you up to the task to bad you can not find server with more then 5 player make the game more for friend group etc rather then for a new comer the end i would have say more but as i mention before lose my idea plus i be not good with write reveiew rather discuss them,pos
3469,early access reviewi get this game solely for my brother the training course give you the op gun but when you get the class you equip bb gun the next issue i have be that this be wwii base and yet we be battle the ussr get your fact right we do hate the commie but they be our ally in this war the new update have make it impossible for u s to win due to the spamming of tank that be almost impenetrable conclusion this game be still in beta and show alot of promise if they fix the game mechanincs and balance the class and vehicle this may just may be agood game until then i ask those who care about historical battle to wait until the creator of the game fix these issue,neg
3470,early access reviewi think this game have a lot of potential there be many feature that have to come aq3d be just not finish yet and there be still quite some work with the passion of ae i think it really can be something the game feel much well than close beta especially in the combat section death animation and small change help a lot also the fact that the game be strive for weekly update which be very nice and you can play it on your mobile phone which be really awesome i just hope that they change the ui for pc i have talk with the dev and they say they will go check it out especially their animator korin which have the same idea as i in there new update on the game they address on some important thing like the ui for pc and combat which be amazing and i be so happy they wil try to do something about it dutch ik vind dat dit game veel potentie heeft er zijn veel feature die moeten komen aq3d be gewoon nog niet af en er moet nog wat flink aan gewerkt worden meet de passie van ae denk ik dat het echt iets kan worden de game voelt veel better dan close beta vooral in de combat death animation en kleine veranderingen helpen veel ook het feit dat de game graag weekly update wil be heel fijn en dat je het op je mobiel kan spelen be ook fijn ik hoop alleen dat ze de ui veranderen voor pc ik heb meet de dev gepraat en ze zeiden dat ze erin zullen gaan kijken vooral hun animator kori vind dat het veranderde moet worden test dit game en als je potentie ziet wacht to winter in hun niewste update van de game hebben ze het over hoe ze de ui voor pc willen gaan veranderen en de combat ik ben heel blij dat ze iets er aan gaan doen,pos
3471,the game be extrectly technical depend on what you be look for this title could be so much fun or terrible boring very much for a technical profile and real life pilot train the game be awsome not for casual player,pos
3472,early access revieweternal be like magic the gathering but with a dark tower esque theme it be an incredibly rich and deep strategy card game that be extremely rewarding for a ftp title it be get colorful and vibrant artwork and table intuitive ui and easy to understand mechanic the only downside for new player at the moment be the mandatory tutorial mission at the beginning that drag for entirely too long but if you can muscle through the beginner content you will find an amazingly rewarding digital card game like no other,pos
3473,early access reviewthe dev really want to make this game look pretty with all the fancy screenshot and artwork and upgrade and currency and everything then you get into the game i use to play a lot of cod back in the day i do not know whether i get so rusty or be it the game it be just so clunky shooting at thing it just do not fall reliable or good for me it be just really annoying and i think they know that hence the whole currency system yeah you be not have fun but you can earn point and buy well gear so that should keep you play you get a bad gun at the beginning and you be suppose to kill stuff exclusively with that gun for fifteen hour if you want to get a decent one but have to play more if you want good upgrade correct me if i be wrong but the more point you get in game the more currency you be award if you just get out out of the low level incubator you be pin against experienced people with tank sniper etc i personally do not like run 3 minute to the battlefront just to get shoot down from who know where in cod that only take like 10 second my point be i be really really frustrated by the game there be no real reason for me to play it i find play the game a drag with the only motivation be get currency for well gun you spawn you run for 2 3 min and maybe maybe you kill a few peep or even make a cap if you be new and have not spend money that will be the case i know the graphic be good the model be pretty it have car and tank and plane and on paper it be a really good game model but i get little actual fun from it to the dev i really do not know what would make me rethink maybe drastically low grind time i dunno sry my opinion a pretty look grindy waste of time,neg
3474,could not play the game have a resolution problem could not get past what look to be a user agreement screen try to change to config file and still could not change the resolution to see the resolution properly,neg
3475,pick this up on a whim and think it would be a gimmick or uninteresting especially be free i be wrong the developer put a lot of work into this game the model in game be base on real world model every part be label with it be correct name down to the small pin roller and spring if you be detail orient mechanically minded or simply curious this will be up your alley whether you be a firearm enthusiast or simply wonder how firearm function check this game out i do not even consider this to be a game but more of a fun educational tool with game on the side there be pay aspect but only if you want to progress faster or move onto a subject other than gun such as military vehicle race car even skeleton etc as for progression within the gun world it be free the game consist of assembly dis assembly function game include a firing range and even paint the firearm you can try to disassemble then reassemble as fast as you can without hasty click and without error for extra point it be very challenging and i be adept at this use actual firearm the x ray feature allow the player to see inside a firearm even while fire reload safety on off etc this be what i like the most about it in the real world one can take apart an actual gun learn the name of the part and understand the basic function but to see the piece in action while inside the gun give us a well understanding of how all the part work together the model be pretty good look too they be not super high re but they be not low res either my only two complaint with this game the way one move around the gun part to get a different angle be awkward sometimes frustrating but it be not game break bad not by any mean just an annoyance at time some area of the breakdown and assembly be draconian when it should not be for example the ak 47 one do not have to remove the accessory pouch from the rifle butt before remove the rifle butt in real life the game penalize the player if the pouch be not remove first though this problem be more of a developer attitude of you have to follow my procedure even if it be not necessary in the real world this be not game breaking either but very frustrating when try to go from start to finish with zero error overall i would recommend this game 100 9 10,pos
3476,early access reviewthis game really start out with so much potential but it all go downhill when the dev decide to make the game pay to play what be the point of playing when i could just take out my credit card and get whatever i want the point of a progression system be to let people learn to play the game before give them all it have to offer but if you can just buy your way up what s the point of a progression system the thing that personally piss me of the most though be all the unnecessarily useless feature in the game like weapon repairing and the fact a scope cost more than e tank honestly the good way to fix this game would be to delete everything and pull up a save from a two year ago it be not to late but in the state it be now i can not possible recommend it to anyone,neg
3477,99 of the review on the hunter be negative because people complain about how it be market as a free to play game if you want to play the game properly you will have to spend a bit of money but after you get a membership the game become sooooooo much better you need to be patient to play the hunter and by the look of the other review not many people on steam be make sure you play the tutorial or you will have no idea what you be do and maybe watch a youtube video or two e g thehunter beginner guide 2016 by hoocairsthehunter if you be a new guest i recommend stick to the tower and call the deer to you as they can see smell and hear you alot well with guest clothe on there be free shotgun in the store which i do not think many guest know about so get the shotgun and go clay pigeon shooting do not worry about waste ammo because it be unlimited in the vacinity of a range or lodge or go pheasant hunting and if you like it buy the membership i also recommend go to thehunter on wikia as it give you tonne of information on reserve and where you can specifically find the animal,pos
3478,so i think i would update my review since thing have change the positive of this game be in no order incredible optimization incredible graphic incredible attention to detail with the vehicle model not damage model though enormous selection of vehicle to playthe downside be gaijin be completeand basically the die fetus of the ussr hard to figure out mechanic for a lot of thing russian vehicle often have game break bug or problem that benefit them that go without fix for month if it hurt them then patch in a day non russian vehicle have a game break bug that benefit them for a day before it be completely patch if it do not benefit them month on end no fix shell that russian vehicle do not mainly use solid ap apds hesh etc be underperforming and unrealistic smoke launcher do not work but you can use artillery which make much more smoke as smoke screen atgms completely ruin what little balance there be matchmaker can be stupidly biased with one team stack with 8 0 tank and enemy team have 7 0 tank basically a point pinata lot of prototype pay to win vehicle grind be e ridiculous repair price be so bad that only the top three people on either team will earn money run good graphic be a disadvantage harder to see enemy in tank lot of unrealistic map and unrealistic situation for tank beta game be use as an excuse for problem when it have content that cost 40 ing quid keep add content without fix content in game community be full of weebs i mean what the off with your anime fetish underage tank girl this be literally the reason germany start kick off easy to exploit game problem lack of information in tank rb make it incredibly tense long winded and really hair raise compression at top tier be so bad that less people play entry level jet and then gaijin compress it more to lower matchmaker time and then less people play aircraft below that aka gaijin just increase br range and low rp cost and these problem will sort themselves lot of arcade gamemode for realistic tank gaijin claim to have realism and do in a lot of aspect but will ignore the community with overwhelming evidence cough maus 240 mm front plate literally measure in real life with a tape measure and gaijin just e ignore it and leave it at 220 mm and other time will change thing in the name of balance instead of realism lot of german suspension be crap in game but there be a video of a panther roll over bump with no problem but in game you break and the entire vehicle wobble for 5 second before the gun can be line up with the target awful tournament which nobody play and end up be money grab get free content require grind off your entire life do not add ship despite lead the community to believe that they could play proper naval vessel and instead add boat because everyone want to sail in rubber ing dingys instead of hms warspite british tank be e boss and actually competitive when first introduce because of apds whilst it be maybe too powerful all solid round across the board be nerfe so that british round be now not only laser pointer but cost silly amount spalling do not exist and apparantly a human in a tank be able to completely absorb a 5 kg round travel at 1400 m s able to penetrate 250 mm of solid steel at 2 km yeh apds have a you hit it you kill it policy with ammorack so if you be off by 2 cm then congrat that ammorack survive and that be 400sl down the drain so to summarize it be a good game with good quality but it be a grind and have extensive problem gaijin be so far up their ownthat they can taste their own tonsil and will never listen to community feedback lest it disadvantage their agenda good luck if you do try it though,neg

3480,the only reason i write this review be that hopefully some change may be do when i first see this game come to steam i be happily suprise as i be a long timer in this game play the mobile version for a very long time and reach the top of global leaderboard the problem i have with this game be not defenetly the quality of the game or the system the use for microtransaction which i actually feel be pretty fair the base problem i have be that the game be stupidly easy once you figure one single tactic the tactic in question be the dart ninja monkey anti lead usually sniper monkey or ninja stun grenade banana farm tower combo with the round 13 regen rainbow rush for the people that be not deeply aware of this strategy let me enlighten you how a normal game could look like place down dart ninja monkey place down banana farm upgrade tower round 12 sell all your farm and use both powerup round 13 just spam the send for regen 3 rainbow ballon and win this be litterally all you have to do to have success in this game once you do it you will find success currently my winrate be about 85 percent and all my loss be to other people with the same strategy but they be just slightly faster spamme the rainbow ballon this be really bad for the game long term and be the reason why i abandonne it on mobile despite be among top player in the world please now take care of your game use your tool at disposal to nerf this strategy and the game may actually turn out pretty fun and tacticly interessting this problem be not new at all but please do something now note i know they do a slight price nerf to the dart monkey but it be not a big deal at all as you have more than enough money from the banana farm to kill your opponent round 13 simply not a good nerf enough,neg
3481,early access reviewnazis ride bike 10 10 good wargame of the year on a serious note its a decent game only problem be the matchmaking 2 10 of the game i play where so unbalanced most of the time there be us ride on bike vs the other team with epic tank destroyer we would get our ass hand to us but remember that this be intentional from the very begin developer want h g to be more like a real war this game be not about fair battle mirror team and kill to death ratio its about take what you get and use it to the good of your ability and if you want to influence battle even more you can become a general more often than not the game be unfair but it can be fun in its own way its most certainly not for everyone though the way they make it be a far cry from how war be fight you do not give your soldier inadequate gear and weapon then send them off to the slaughter and expect them to win you give them equipment that be better suit for the situation and be capable of stand some sort of a stance sir the enemy have a squad of tank what should we do well we have a ton a bike use those b but sir do i stutter saddle up and peddle on out there son the tank vs bike battle come to be because of the difference in source that each faction have from my understanding the unbalance be partially cause by the people play on the axis side have have way more warfund to buy resource with than the people in the ally side this cause the unbalance in battle and the one sided war that have occur for some time now additionally since the axis side end up wine more often player switch faction and thus more player end up join the axis which do not help much with the balance if you be on the ally side the above reason be the likely cause of the bike vs tank battle additionally if you want to avoid these sort of battle when play on either faction when you click on enter combat select find mission and when you click on a battle you can view the resource available at that time choose random mission match you in a battle without take resource into account,pos

3487,first off i have spend alot of time in this game i would would not recommend it to someone who have a low income rate or be not prepared to spend moneythe game can be fun and have a bit of life in it each new town be awesome to go to when you unlock it and the dungeon that come with it be really cool look but have to do them atleast 3 time to move on to the next one in the story line be really annoying it move up to 5 8 time in the high level the leveling in the game be really hard to do without get an exp boost item its even hard with that but alittle easy i have a charcter in the 80 cap be 85 at time of writting and do one dungeon give about 8 9 of the exp bar and dungeon be your main sorce of levelingstay out of the item mall if you do play i repeat stay out of the item mall it be not need to go into it but get something from it cost alot of money there be costume in this game and you would expect them to have nop stat and just change how you look kog say that you buy a costume it make your stat better than a f2p the costume cost around 25 31 dollar to get the whole set which also have set bonus to increase your stat even more pvp be not worth do all pvp come down to be stun lock its a system whereif you get hit you be stunned for a second and if you keep hit they stay stunned there be a way to get out of it but it be crap it boil down to who can hit first and that s it which make so slow attack charcter useless if anyone loss in pvp they just complain about something you do or that a charcter be op i will admit new charcter be pretty unbalanced and kog take their sweettime balance themover its not to bad of a game even though i have jsut be rant the scenery in each town field and dungeon look awesome but you spend so much time in town little time in field and so many run in dungeon it losse it attraction to be there the charcter all have their own personality and be really cool each one play differntly then the other and it have a job system where you can change how they play ever further guild can feel like home if your in the right one but big one can fall very easily and not many people talk i only have so many hour in this game because i only get on to talk to friend i have make in it in conclusion i would recommend this game if this thing i state up above be improve and make well to make the game alot more fun but as it be right now i simply do not not recommend it if you love fantasy place and explore or grind a on you may enjoy this game but if not stay away i hope the review help your decision in download this game and have fun if you do,neg

3497,i download this game not because i be familiar with how to train your dragon but because the description remind me of a game i have not play in nearly two decade call dragonseed for the playstation 1 i come into this not even think that it be possible for a game to be release nowadays with graphic that be on par with a sixteen year old game not to mention this pay system twenty minute into the game and you will already have a large flashing button on the ui tell you that you have 10 day to pay for a starter pack and that s not even the first thing behind gem you come in contact with when you have to pick an egg for your future dragon the one not even two step away from where you start be lock for member only you want a cool dragon 5 please you want to skip the tutorial 5 please you want to have a second character slot membership pleaseyou want a third character more money pleasefourth cashfifth even more moolah,neg
3498,i prefer this game a lot over the actual world tank for a few reason 1 game be more appropriately time not twenty minute in the pc version this usually last five minute 2 community be not toxic3 easy to progress4 there be not so many good player like in the original version so you actually have a chance to learn how to play well in this5 match be actually fairly create in this where in the original if you be at the bottom you be probably screw this game give you a guarantee fighting chance,pos
3499,early access reviewgreat game intuitive ui and smooth gameplay mix with the richness and strategy of a deep cardgame like mtg very free to play friendly allow you to quickly build a decent collection and a competitive deck frequent event and rebalance keep thing fresh without rely on release too many set too quickly,pos
3500,generic clicker game that add a little more flavor and pleasing asthetic to the mix like most clicker game you have plenty of way to increase your coin click and idletime passive gain in this the difficulty curve be more pleasing because you start with a set of spell to jumpstart your game you gain monster coin on a chance per click basis and plenty of path for upgrade your coin gain pro f2p you can put money into the game but from what i gather you will not want to until high tier building much later on asthetically pleasing clicker open well enough so you can see your growth plenty of task that keep progression interestingcon no sound no music only the sound of my mouse click frantically long gap of wait time between progression at the end of the day it be just another clicker gametl dr 7 10one of the well clicker game out there right now imo it be not just a screen to click on yes it be but you can see progression and get your task do in a fairly reasonable amount of time like most clicker game just have a lot of patience and do not expect too much,pos

3503,this game only work if you guy not have phone in all seriousness this game be dope a megaton of content and completely free it be complex and fun and instead of increase number value on set item every few month like blizzard do with diablo iii they actually make new and engaging content and release them as a new league completely free to everyone to play sure you can enhance your experience with extra stash tab or cosmetic if you want to but you be never bare from any activity in the game because you do not want to pay i highly recommend path of exile for people who love deep and engaging action rpg,pos
3504,early access reviewok here be my review about this game the game itself be nice graphic and fun for combat and neat for tame pet and lot of other cool thing but hhis game be go to fail big time and there be only 2 reason for this reason number 1 you can not send mail to your friend reason number 2 you can not trade item to your friend these 2 thing be the most important function to have work in a mmorpg why would a game company make a mmorpg and include a mail system that only allow you to send mail to alternate character and when you right click on a friend who be in your party there be a trade with player option but when attempt to use it you get error message and it turn out the company who make bless online be not allow people to trade with their friend the trade be option be 100 disabled on purpose by the game company they say its to stop gold seller lmaothis game have a massive craft system and like any mmorpg there be always alot of people who love to trade stuff to their friend and family who play the game in order to help them level their crafting and or give them in game money to help them buy stuff as well as to avoid auction house fee if you can just sell directly to another player instead as well as craft ton of gear to give to their friend and family for free they say they do this to stop gold seller this do not stop gold seller at all as they can just ask the person who want to buy gold to put up a crap item on the auction house for a huge amount of gold which the gold seller will buy and this allow the person buy gold to get their gold this also prevent crafter from craft item to give to their friend or family unless they can somehow manage to buy it on the ah for a low price before someone else get it when try to help out friend and family with craft mat and or gear i find this be a game breaker for me me and 4 friend just get this game a few day ago and we all find out today we can not trade or mail each other so we all just quit the game right now they should just make this game single player game since you can not trade or mail your friend lmao this game be 100 doom to fail,neg
3505,this game be amazing i love the how to trian your dragon movie and show and this be just the kinda game be be look for even though i wish they have put more quest to get dragon egg in the game i still love it and enjoy fly and playing game with my friend on our very own dragon,pos
3506,early access reviewthe graphic be really dope and well optimize the gameplay be clunky and the menu setting be lack but that s to be expect of ea strange humorous theme of man in their underwear with cook utensil for armor and ww2 gun kind of bizarre imo but okay why i dislike the game game launch in a seperate application when the match start so that s 3 app a launcher a menu and the actual game run do the dev not know how to put together a game next the client run in the background it launch when you start up your pc so i assume it instal some unwanted registry key that i do not give any consent to finally my desktop completely freeze up when i switch window to start up a recording the cursor be lock in place so i could not do anything and alt tabbing cause the window switching menu to freeze in the middle of my screen force me to reboot no thank do not want to deal with that again especially since i be in the middle of back up datum when it happen,neg
3507,i probably have the less fun play this game than any other racing game to date i boot up the game and end up wait about 7 hour for the confirmation email to come so that i could activate my account and actually log into the game this be the reason for my 8 hour of play time while i leave the game minimize while wait for the email to come i be finally able to log in and be bombard with the cluster of a menu there do not seem to me to be any sort of rhyme or reason to how the menu be set up and the not so large amount of content be mask behind a seemingly endless menu which be all lock behind a paywall anyway once i get into what seem to be the only track available to me in what seem to be the only car available to me it take me a while to get use to not use a racing line in a game after ten lap or so i be finally able to race around the track decently quick but be conitinue to be annoy by the way the game play the physics seem decent enough but as far as be any fun it feel completely stale and uninteresting to me the only track available for free do not appeal to me at all and i do not care too much for the car either i be use a controller to race and the game still just feel really rigid stiff and so unexciting that after a couple more lap i decide that i be do with it the final product just feel to me well free they put a lot of focus on make the game seem quite real the game definitely have a unique feel to it that you notice all the way through but i be not go to give any of it a chance when the racing itself just leave me bore it kinda feel like a free version of gran turismo except not fun or good from head to toe it be just absolutely not visceral or exciting in the slight,neg
3508,the game be really fun and look great a lot well to play with friend since some quest take like 3 hour plus if you be not into do quest for that long do not play all in all seem like a great community and a really fun game to play with friend and alone,pos
3509,between two account i have log in arguably too much time i think its around 1800 hour what the be with 7 00 i agree with most the negative review of this new update they completely change what be already a great game they have a solid and diehard loyal group of player and 7 00 be like spit in our mouth and tell us its champagne i see what they be do valve want to appeal to a young generation of player that do not i repeat do not want to play dota 2 that be why they play league of legend or hero of the storm or smite they want a fast pace game that require little to no knowledge of tactic strategy or the game mechanic i use to say dota 2 be the chess of mobas difficult and require more skill to play than the checker of mobas like league now with 7 00 dota have become a checker moba give me back my tactical moba give us back our chess valve revert the change back to 6 88 and turn the change for 7 into dota 3 do noton your loyal player,neg
3510,have invest 150 hour into the android game switch to pc make me want far more depth than what fallout shelter offer it be a fun diversion but it be mostly a diversion i have play with when i be away from my pc if you have never try the game on mobile device it may hold your interest for a bit but like many f2p game with micro transaction there be a lot of waiting involve personally i would rather be play fallout 4 but at least this one be free,pos

3512,well its definitely more comfortable than the mobile version loading time be way short and it fit better on the screen if you have a big vault its somehow not very optimize vor pc especially regard control and setting but i also have minor graphical bug as well the game itself be the typical freemium wait or pay formula except that its a little bit less bad than most other of these game there be more thing to do and you will most likely unlock a lot by just play the gameplay mechanic be nothing new but it have some enhancement like take you to mission area that look different to gather loot i think the fallout universe fit very well for this type of game there be plenty of item place and other thing you know from fallout that give the game some depth so if chi ching slotmachine sound let you have the pleasure of achieve something in a videogame this be the game for you,pos
3513,do not really know whether i should recommend this game or not cause it have big potential but the developer misstreate it you need money to unlock certain stuff not pay to win though and its really hard to get in get good equipment drop no matter if the stat be the one you need take longer than just buy what you want from well player it also do not get many update i would love to love this game but i can not,neg

3530,if you like diablo like this one be free and really good so you should probably play it do not worry too much about the free2play aspect it be all cosmetic and additional tab for your stash the place in town where you store item if you be unfamiliar and those stash tab be cheap and you probably will not even need more than what they give you anytime soon it do a few interesting different thing from your typical diablo like for the most part you will feel like you be play diablo or grim dawn atmosphere and much of the gameplay or torchlight 2 gameplay some of those different interesting thing be as follow the active skill system which be similar to how materia work in final fantasy 7 your equipment have socket on it and you fit your skill gem into those socket if there be link socket you can place support gem in there and give the main skill additional effect such as add element damage piercing turn that skill into a trap that you throw on the ground instead of one that you actively cast etc it be a very neat way to help people build a character skill set to make it their own load of possibility the passive system similar to final fantasy 10s sphere grid do anyone else get the feeling that the dev have play a lot of ps1 2 era final fantasy again if you be unfamiliar i will try to explain every character class start out somewhere on this large kinda boardgame like matrix on the passive skill window this screen be full of these little node connect by path when you level up or complete certain quest and get a skill book you get a point to unlock a node each node grant something like more strength intelligence dexterity health mana mana regeneration attack speed etc there be also big node that usually grant several benefit at once and or a passive skill you have to follow the branch path from node to node around the board toward one that you want to get you can even choose to build your path toward other part of the board if you want some of the benefit of another character class one of the character class that you do not have access to early on start smack dab in the middle of the board allow them to branch out toward anything they desire the bartering system this one a little weird but it be a pretty neat idea basically there be no gold in this game but there be certain item in the world that both serve a practical purpose and be use as currency to trade with npc vendor for example a scroll of wisdom be use to identify your special item but it be also a form of currency these item be find in their whole form and in fragmented form the fragment automatically become a whole when you have enough of them when you sell stuff you get these currency item or at least fragment of them instead of money when you buy stuff you spend them want that frostbolt skill gem it will cost you one full scroll of wisdom anyway if you like this type of game there be really no reason not to try it it be free2play do right because you can have a full fun experience without spend a dime of real money or you can deck yourself out in purple flaming armor fairy wing and glow footprint that be up to you,pos
3531,of write this review i can not really recommend this game i think it have a lot of potential but there be certain aspect that be really bothersome for myself pro great artwork a lot of fun option to personalize your build cute animal and charater design free to try 20 to upgrade to pro if you likecons constant lag spike and frame stutter nauseating jump animation especially bad with simultaneous lag spike lack of npc or npc village the game desperately need some life tame pet do not help in combat no buff attack or anything would be nice if they add this feature i think the artwork be great its much easy to look at than unmodded minecraft i like the ability to rotate block give you a lot more control over your buildssaw a guy make an ai tic tac toe game use the machine system they have like minecraft redstone the breaking point for me be the lag spike i can only assume it be due to their server or perhaps because they have not get to the polishing stage in their development i get lag spike and frame stutter constantly when i play and it have become almost nauseating if you pair that with the really bounce jumping animation its a pretty horrible experience i usually stay away from mountainous area because of this almost have to close my eye when i jump because of motion sickness they need to make the jumping animation smoother and figure out what s cause all these lag spike it seem like a hot topic and they say they be look into it but until its fix i personally can not play it perhaps other will not have any issue it would be cool if there be an option in the world setting that you could toggle to add sloped block to every edge of every block when the world be generate so you would not need to jump i do this to all the the block around my house because jumping be so unbearable it look and feel great like this so smooth running up and down surface the world desperately need some kind of npc village i know they be try to be different than minecraft but it be basically a minecraft copy and one of the great thing about minecraft be the npc village a little bit of a life in an otherwise bland game tame pet help you in combat would be great maybe limit it to a few or if they do not fight maybe they provide buff or useful utility like provide a light source or something this would add a fun dynamic to the game currently i just use them to farm material it be ok but perhaps they will add combat option for pet in the future more block option i would love to be able to use all those unique block like the thin snow top that sit on top of block in the snowy area would love to be able to place that on the roof or something perhaps i miss it i know they be work on a option to place item like food onto surface that would be a great addition and easy way to heat your home in cold environment other than put a fireplace or fire every 3 4 block i know a lot of people complain about the pro pack cost money but i honestly see the pro pack as the full game purchase you must pay 20 for minecraft and i understand pay 20 to unlock this game i think the creativerse model of try before you buy be a great idea game company need to make money somehow i get it you still get to play 80 of the game for free aside from the pro pack the only other stuff lock in the store be the cool texture pack like galactic and medieval and a few specialty item they be inexpensive to purchase you can build amazing thing without ever purchase these pack so until they fix the lag spike and jumping animation i personally can not recommend this game if and when they manage to fix it i would be happy to upgrade to pro and continue play,neg
3532,17 hour into it overall i be happy with it one of the big thing about it be that there be a big learning curve but once your past that it be a very fun game so as long as you can have some patient the tutorial need some work it be not always clear with its direction and some arrow point to thing would be nice since it just describe what thing look like in the cockpit there be some thing that they describe that fit multiple thing the control can take get use to but after a while its fine for the most part but there be a lot of control and find a part of control can be difficult sometimes another compliant i have be i feel that a lot of the price for dlc should be low or to at least bundle more thing i find out they raise some price earlier this summer by 10 and even 20 the original price be more reasonable my finale complaint be it crash more than it probably should i have a decent computer that can run it at a consistent 60fps on low and medium graphic the freeze seem to come out of nowhere i also have some low fps and freeze that happen for a short time when fire weapon but this for some reason do not happen anymore at the moment a 7 10,pos

3554,in short its a moba with spaceship so if you like moba or space action there be very little chance not to like it in my personal opinion it get the well version both genre as a moba its lane be not fill with ai control creep rather the lane be control by the player so the player have the all the control over the game and as a spaceship game it have spaceship with proper and detailed space aesthetic and game mechanic by the way the game may feel bit slow at the beginning as the ship seem to move slowly even jet also seem to move slowly when we see it in relation to sky but game play be quite fast because average match length be 10 20min if its not then either both team be really very good or horribly bad,pos
3555,this game suck it be like dayz but a cheap knock off version typical free to play pay to win trash full of microtransaction the graphic be terrible the combat be even bad and there be no stealth when it come to zombie as they chase you regardless of whether or not you be sneak the map be also extemely basic and you have to pay in order to access server with any good loot the only possitive i can think of be the vault where you can stash the loot you pick up along the way which be kind of make redundant because the gun be all pretty much the exact same bottom line you get what you pay for,neg

3557,there be a number of quality about this game that make it endearing even to long time player of fps game it do have a very stylized look cartoon like and its gameplay be not an attempt to realistically simulate combat but because the game utilize multiple class each with different ability team fortress 2 create a diverse range of gameplay scenario the acquisition of item be a rather entertain little meta game in itself essentially it be a shooter that can allow player on oppose team to strategize and adapt their play as they see fit with some player prefer scout sniper medic or engineer role among other the diversity of player choice help keep the game fresh even long after you have play every map and scenario if you enjoy teamwork shooter game it may be worth a look,pos

3576,to start i should say that war thunder have be a positive influence on my life overall when the community be good it be great i have form many last friendship and i be currently in a relationship of almost a year with someone i meet through the game but war thunder have a problem with woman not all player be like that not even the majority but enough s be loud enough to ruin the experience for so many girl i know and we as a community can do better i be a woman i like to play comp and i get on voice to make call out and provide encouragement for the most part it be fine and we all have a good time except when the enemy j1 somehow get me every push but there be time when teammate get toxic in a way that do not get apply to male player and sometimes the very presence of a female voice in the chat be enough to set people off it be not funny when you ask me if i will send nude or if i will perform an obscene act for you even if you be joke it be really not funny i promise it be grate to be continually ask if i be a bomber main since i be a girl or for you to demand that i pocket you i do not play bomber sorry how about naval plane it be especially not funny to be harass to have people make video of them troll me and to receive dozen of hateful message after to be tell to kill myself to be call a bimbo and aand much much bad i have block people who then make multiple account to continually harass me when play with my girlfriend we have be call all kind of sexist epithet plus an extra helping of homophobia when they find out we be date and despite all this i still get on mic and speak partly because i be not about to let a few sweaty manchildren ruin my gaming experience but partly because it be more than just me time and time again i have have other girl timidly get on mic when they hear my voice and express their relief at hear another girl they say they do not usually talk out of fear but that it be nice to hear a friendly voice people say that there be not any girl gamer but that could not be furth from the truth you have just create a climate where they be too scared to talk because many of them have experience the same thing as me i know most of you be decent people i be lucky to have a close circle of player who be talented kind people but we as a community need to do a well job of stand up against this kind of poor behavior more than just report it when you see it although i wholly recommend do that make it know that you do not tolerate sexist conduct even a simple hey man that be not cool can both 1 let the harasser know that their behavior be not condone and 2 let the harassee know that decent people do exist the silence of complicity and the silence of dissent sound the same speak up to make your true color shine so please be mindful foster an environment that welcome female player and do not forget to bomb the airfield eta thank for the mostly supportive response i appreciate it it mean a lot to me that the average person still know how to be polite like i say it be the good egg who make this community what it be a couple people have say thing akin to this be the internet grow a thick skin etc i be well aware of how the internet can be and i do have a tremendously thicc skin as a result it be not me i be worried about a lot of people do not have such a thicc skin and it be those girl who be not as harden as i be who really suffer just because i be a harden shrew do not mean we all have to be people have also say thing akin to if you do not want to be subject to homophobic harassment when you be play with your girlfriend you should not announce to people that you guy be date aside from put the blame on me which i think be unfair i do not think these people understand the dynamic at play it be not like i announce to everyone hey guy this be my girlfriend we be date although i really ought to because she be a phenomenal woman what generally happen be one of us will refer to other as babe during a game e g nice pilot knockout babe then someone ask if we be date and then all hell break loose also every person who respond to this post with shut up bomber just prove my point i know you think you be hilarious but you be not go to get a comedy special for your scathing wit,neg

3597,early access reviewthis be a moba game with big spaceship and even big potential whether the developer will achieve that potential be another matter but they be definitely on the right track if the premise sound appealing to you you will enjoy the game and it be worth the price of admission it be very well do however it be early access and as such there be a lot of miss function some balance issue bug and a lack of content which appear to be in the process of be address my big concern at the moment in term of i want to have fun right now be the lack of tooltip detail let me explain you get choice on which weapon ability to load your ship with however there be absolutely zero description of what any of the weapon do aside from the name so you kind of have to try them all and figure out how they be suppose to work yes this will obviously be address but in the game current state there be sort of an unnecessarily high learning curve still once i figure thing out i start have a ton of fun and i be glad i pay the 10 i be have fun find new way to sneak up on enemy and blow them to piece,pos

3603,thehunter be thepaytohavefun game as much as i would like to recommend a hunting game that be this open and support multiplayer it take way too much time and effort to be able to do anything but hunt mule deer when you first start out you can only hunt mule deer and rabbit the trick be that you do not have a gun to hunt rabbit with instead you have to earn currency by hunt mule deer in a couple different challenge and competition which do not give you enough currency to do much at all even if you do paytohavefun it be for a limited time that you can access all the animal license and a limited time to acess all the hunting ground the only thing you get to keep be the item and gun and you have to keep hunt to get more currency to keep buy ammo for the gun you want to keep use except for the start gun,neg
3604,i think this game be one to watch it really be a very high quality racing simulator especially consider it be free a little too far down the realism spectrum for my liking though the main problem be that there be no sense of accomplishment or incentive to keep play in most racing game you win race to unlock new track and car which keep you want to play on but here you unlock new stuff by buy it also the race them self be just against the clock there be very little sense of accomplishment from just move a few place up the leader board so as i say i think this be one to keep an eye on as more content become available,pos

3607,although you do need to invest some money to get the most enjoyment out of this game as you can it be definitely worth it as an avid hunter for over ten year now i never think i would find a video game that could come close to what the great outdoors be like with each and every update thehunter inch closer and closer to this mark actually it hit that mark a long time ago and just get close towards absolute perfection the only thing a person really need to buy be a weapon or two or ten or thirty just so you have the ability to hunt every animal you need compatible weapon if you do mission and grind a bit you can do this completely free to play but it can be discourage and see a large or trophy animal or even a rare variant appear before you and know you can not take that trophy due to license restriction would be disheartening so really the only money anyone should spend would be on a subscription which for a year be well price in my opinion especially if you do the trailblazer pack that come with plenty of weapon and camouflage at this point it just become a game you pay once for and it be like you be buy dlc if you really like it you have the weapon and gear permanently and if you play that year you purchase you should have enough gm to renew license and ammunition on top of everything it be multiplayer single lobby do exist but be able to hunt with a friend and scout together or compete for the large trophy it be just load of fun even count down from 3 1 so you both can take down trophy simultanaeously it be just great overall,pos

3617,due to all the negativity surounde this game i want to say my point my name be babyface and by my hour you may guess that i love this game the problem people have with this game be that they think it be another pay to play win game however it be much like the situation with call of duty black op 3 it be pay to add more playability or fun to the game with game witch give the option to pay it be just their way of ask if you want to support their game i have spend roughly 20 on this game and that be on a pack of cubit and the chloromanser pack sorry if spelt wrong i do get the point that people have spend more money on the game on it than me but do not go attack the dev of this game just because your account get wipe if it be due to the bandwagon of account wipe then you should have play on it more if it be due to an attack on your account then it be a cause of concern the dev can not really do anything about that which i be sorry to hear about it however if it be refund in their currency then there be not a problem on other game similar to this one this have happen to me and the support do not help however with really supportive dev i think that they will do anything they can do my overall conclusion do not give the devsif you lose your item and they could not retreave it however if you feel personally that they do jack carry on complain this game be subjective and you can like it one second and despise it the next i love the game and i think more people should play it however thati just my opinion thank you for read for those who do not want to read this just watch this instead cause it be pretty funny,pos

3620,i be very thrilled to play this game after watch the film and series but this game be very disappointing most of the new dragon that have be introduce in the series be only for member only they say that nothing be for free these day yet when i use to play game nothing be that hard to get but these day its cash cash cash its very disapointing but let me shed some light on this game before i get to the huge down fall this game be go to be mostly recommnede to the fan of the how to train your dragon this game style and design look a lot like the style of the series that be currently on netflix the character of the main cast be in it and help you along the way you even get to meet their dragon as well the area of the game change to the current season which be nice and you can recognize a lot of the area you get to raise your dragon from a baby to its adult form very cute and you get to choose the colour but you can not fly for a very long time remind me of istaria the animation mechanic be ok a little buggy but not bad now here be the down fallssometime when exit the area the loading screen will come up it will nag you to get a membership it will take a while to get to the next area once it do it will appear again before you can move on and do your quest or task around the area sadly sometimes when you say no to the membership the game will crash i struggle to get out of this on wide screen so if any of you have a pc that struggle to run these type of game please keep it on window just incase it decide to crash on you after the crash i decide to check the review sadly all the negative be right you take a few step and it already crash on you exit an area to another it will crash go fishing it will lag so much as well as when you chop down tree for wood it will lag so bad that your game will crash and freeze your pc another reason to keep it on window unfortunatly i have to get rid of the game due to the graphic and lag on the game it crash 3 time load it back up be more quick than get around the area do not play this game if you do not want your pc to suffer from crash and freezesplay this game on window just to be safebut overall i highly recommend you to not play this game its need much more work because it still look like its in testing it look very much like the old graphic from a very old console let say ps1 sort of style yes i know that sound very harsh but its true it also need more free stuff than just membership stuff the lag make it very frustrating to play because you can hardly go anywhere i be very disappointed in this game but if your little one would like to play it make sure your pc can run alright on it and keep it on window just be on the safe side but do not be surprised if it crash on window screen as well,neg
3621,i will not say i be veteran of this game since i have not play this game since beta but i start play it after beta be over get about 200h in it do not play that much until i get new pc last year to simplify review this be 3rd person view moba and for champion you have old god match make kinda poor but gameplay be kinda fun and if you play solo like me it be go to suck 70 of time while another 30 be go to be joy also unlike any moba you get free gem which you can use to buy skin which be awesome over all i would give it 7 out 10,pos
3622,product receive for freeearly access reviewthe movement camera interface and all the basic stuff look like they be take from some 2005 free2play mmo i do not care if it be early access stupid excuse of many useless developer nowadays this game fail some time ago in asia now they look for success in eu and na but they have not change anything it be garbage it be garbage and will most likely die as garbage in na eu same as it die in other region,neg
3623,game mechanic be rough and not very responsive which make the combat very anticlimatic and remove the immersive feeling of be in a war the visual be decent but also do not create the immersive environment and look very fake i be not say that every game have to be realistic but since the creator have take this route they should put more work into that i have to say the developer have leave quite a few setting to suit your need but for my opinion there be more con than pro,neg
3624,early access reviewthe game be great but the downfal to this game be the aim hacker black squad dev thrive on these people and support their effort they will not allow us to report them with that say for a free game yeah its fine but the people who own this game give a rat azz about their player community everyte in their shop be way too much so if you want to have all the cool toy you have to pay i do think it be worth try as the game and control be great i just truly hope the developer crack down on the hack,pos
3625,the time of writing this review i have roughly 620 hour log into dcs i confess that i own nearly all of the module i play dcs primarily for the single player experience not the multiplayer one this be due to the netcode that dcs have it be rather garbage for multiplayer however multiplayer issue aside dcs be one of the good aviation simulation to date yes the module prop plane jet plane helicopter several map and one mostly unpolished unloved land vehicle module be expensive but they be nearly always stunning in their level of detail and the quality of the experience almost always leave this particular aviation enthusiast in a sense of awe i recommend this game to any aviation enthusiast who have the follow a lot of patience and time to research the module they want to learn a powerful computer and a hotas hand on throttle and stick setup have trackir trackhat greatly improve the experience,pos
3626,early access reviewdumb take away the leveling system and now the game be super unbalanced i recommend not get this game because the creator be idiot and make it a pay to win they also take away earn in game money from single player now i have to sell my stuff to get other stuff which be really gay once again do not get the game the game be crap,neg
3627,early access reviewok let us start with basic the gameplay be good it be weird to not run with shift key but well graphic be enjoyable it be not a likely p2w game so cool the only trouble that i do find that i do not know if this can be fix somehow it be that other mode that be not the quick match most of the room be empty and it be hard to find a match but well if you be there just to do quick match and have fun i will recommend u this game7 5 10,pos
3628,early access reviewnot quite as complicated as magic but more depth than hearthstone eternal be a solid f2p ccg that look to be on the right track look forward to see where they take it as it grow,pos
3629,out of the gate its a fun and addictive game however after about a week of fairly heavy play its flaw shine through the game really become an over complicated coin flip simulator heavily base on luck sure a core part of these card game be luck but this game be excessively luck base because of its design flaw 1 there be very limited and straight forward strategy that pretty much begin and end with produce unit to attack the enemy give them equipment to make them hit harder and then produce unit that destroy or stop them or really cheap simple kill card to stop them that be pretty much all the game offer strategically 2 the automatic mana aspect which start low and grow each turn be part of the problem as it take out an entire important strategic aspect of card game be resource and its management so most game will proceed through a rather mundane same old same old start until each player hit 6 mana at the same time at which point luck of the draw will determine the outcome my unit out mash down your avatar or your spam of guard unit plus kill card stop me with only an extremely small sample of counter card that typically be limit to silence or remove guard or unit with guard or instant kill card include silence so most deck be just zerg just flood the board with cheap unit that buff stat of each other and overwhelm outdraw each other while no resource make initial learn curve really small in the end it destroy the game as it also preclude any real depth of gameplay and strategy so it get boring repetitive luck of the draw really fast take a week of 3 4 hour a day play before it set in for me since eventually both player have plenty of mana to play super card and well its just luck if you draw the 2 4 super card of your 50 before i do 3 the comeback mechanic of break rune to get draw be another very flawed mechanic that again just reduce the game down to raw luck at first it seem really quit cool then you realize it just penalize you for win completely negate a entire deck strategy often refer to as burn deck just focus on kill the avatar but it get even further compound by prophecy card which be card you auto get to play for free if the opponent break a rune a comeback mechanic be great but not this iteration since there be no strategy now if you have to have the resource aka mana to use the prophecy card then you may have a strategic asset to gameplay but its not it just turn the game even more to a basic luck of the draw maybe if they refine this to be strateigc it would add to the game but right now it simply remove it 4 finally the game balance turn to crap because in the end most of the truly powerful card in these type of game have extraordinary play cost make them a risky choice and difficult to bring into play but with the ever automatically increase mana per turn this no longer apply so once we hit 9 10 mana if you draw your supercard which be wildly powerful due to its mana cost you win i lose if i draw it i win you lose because the card at so insanely powerful for example a card may have 10 dmg 10 defense and when it come into play it automatically do 4 6 dmg to every unit in this game most unit have 1 4 hp so it wipe the board and now you have a 10 10 unit that your only hope be a luck draw to to stop it since all your unit just perish gg win to auto loss via pure random luck with no way to control zero counter play so until they add more card with actual interesting mechanic and if they tweek some poorly design mechanic right now this be a basic deathmatch heavily base on luck which be the antithesis of what make these card game fun so it start off fun but before long it become bland and boring af do not get suckere into buy pack off your initial experience give it some solid game like 50 100 normal before you truly have a feel for the game,neg
3630,early access reviewthis be a great game for early access i would recommend this game to anyone that be a fan of fps game it be fun fast paced and entertain the only few downside to this game be the lack of european and or british server and the lack of controller support i really like the concept that each match you need to purchase weapon with currency you gain from kill enemy the only downside be the fact that everyone start the match with 2000 and that defeat the point as you have enough to purchase a weapon there also need to be a party aspec in this game so you can join a party with your friend and start a match i enjoy this game for what it be and i be excited for the change that be add in it be developement in the early access stage,pos

3633,trove be a classic grind mmo with an option to fast forward the grinding with real money the game be fun the different class lend some diversity to an otherwise routine game the enemy balance well with the player level and the game be pace so as to offer the player a reward at interval that make it fun and keep the game feeling like an adventure one of the great feature be the cornerstone your own plot of ground that you can build and outfit as you see fit and move with you as you move from biome to biome the downside be that grind mmo require functional server to enjoy and the developer can not seem to maintain a server or push a patch successfully to save their life in the past two week since i begin play with 48 5 hrs on record there be not a day that pass without the server go down disruption of less than an hour or 2 do not make the forum i think the dev see them as common but look at the forum you can see that the server go down for long period at approximately 2 day interval to playfun biome to exploreblock buildingmobile home basecon server be down regularlyenemie and boss lack varietygame play be repetitive,neg
3634,early access reviewthe game be a solid ccg but i can not recommend due to one major issue mana screw the game be very much magic the gathering and if that be what you be look for you will like eternal the problem i have with it be they duplicate mtg big flaw too many game be decide by to much or to little power this would have be ok a few year ago but many other game have solve this problem a ccg be random already why make it even more random by not fix a frustrating power mana mechanic it be a valiant attempt but if you goal be to make a well version of something than you should probably fix it be big problem,neg

3643,although a decently entertaining little card game currently the ring of magica be overpower to the point where you will lose any game against a decent not new start player if you start 1st serious balancing be require on that point also the prophecy system annoy the live daylight out of me possibly due to the fact that my hero refuse to pull prophecy card when his rune be break and in stead pull them on his turn make them less effective or fun to use while my opponent seem to have none of these issue but that be rng i guess as the game hardly bring something new to the table i do not see it compete with hearthstone and with gwents release closing in i have a feeling legend will not be around very long,neg

3650,a game with a good concept combat system and character class design and have potential but have horrible optimization and player friendly setting on top of that target mode be different for class some have action and other have classic which be autistic for two reason 1 already it change the gameplay for each person drastically how can you make pvp like this even if a targeting mode would not work for a system make a work around that be fari for player 2 it be well for each person to choose the targeting mode they want test them out maybe swap between them rather than force it onto them make for a more friendly system and well gameplay,neg

3653,this game have good production its smooth look good sound good be fun be addictive be pay 2 win i finish the story in about 5 hour it be pretty interesting then they thow you right into competition you have a couple of choice but everything either cost gold to enter or be against other player the problem with the first be that gold be what you need to buy card but if you lose you get nothing so its a 50 50 actually its weighted way against you if you only have starter deck that you may even get enough gold to advance however after a few round the house will win and you will be stick grind in casual mode against other player again if you lose you get nothing you be fight people who have well card than you because they buy them and when you lose you get nothing i do not mind a grind but this be not a grind it be a pay wall do not play this game if you do not want to spend money on it do yourself a favor and see the playtime on all the other review you will quickly notice that those who give it a positive rating be still in story mode under 5 6 hour and those who give it a negative rating start hit that wall 7 10 hour,neg

3662,let me be clear this game take some serious getting use to you will be lose for the first several hour and even after that figure out how you fit into your team overall objective be go to be difficult i have the major benefit of join a platoon a group of squad and squad leader work together under the command of a platoon leader early on and do so go a long way towards help me understand how to play the game well as an indavidual you must decide what role you want to fill in the game and how it can best benefit your team this mean pick a class and stick to it for the most part for those of you who think immediately i want to snipe some word of caution you will be kill counter snipe and push around a lot in the begining your kill count will be low and firefight will be overwhelm the scope of this game be massive and unlike a certain overly popular gaming franchise on console cough cod cough just because you have a sniper rifle do not mean you be go to be a headhunting god out the gate battlefield esqe bullet drop and highly limited breath holding capability will see to that you will likely be outperform by hard scoper if you try to play the quickscope game here long weapon rechamber and reload time will ensure that why because this game do not feel that every soldier on the battlefield be equal headshot can not kill every target in one hit especially depend on the rifle you use with a fair few require two or more hit to kill regardless of where you hit your target at a range beyond 400 meter only the high powered weapon will drop target in one shoot only one faction specific weapon have the damage output to headshot most target in one hit at any range downside it have a trigger delay and that will throw your shot way off target start to sound unfair welcome to planetside where every faction have very distinct pro and con to its equipment set and ability for those of you who prefer to be in the thick of the fight prepare to be outflank double team and own by vehicle en masse your k d be go to hurt in the begining no two automatic weapon be equal in any way find one that work well for you and stick to it with all of this say this game be not newbie friendly veteran player will have a more diverse set of weapon well implant and know many of the nook and cranny you may try to hide in advantage be the layout of each continent have change a few time over the year so there be plenty of spot yet to be use frequently this game be somewhat p2w allow you to use real money to get that shiny new weapon a lot faster however with the exception of a few differently colored weapon iteration whose stat be exactly the same as the base model nothing in this game be unobtainable by simply play the game but it be a grind as be every mmo ever make still sound like your kind of challenge welcome to the battle for auraxis pick your side pick your gun and strap yourself in you be not in kansas anymore,pos

3664,early access reviewso i be actually enjoy this game or rather i should say i really want to do not seem pay to win keep in mind i only have 2 hour play i finish the campaign sometimes lose pointlessly because i could not draw sigil and do my first gauntlet run i be excited to see what this gamemode would be the idea of play to win well reward to meet an ultimate boss and get the final tier prize be entice anyway i lose my first match instantly and that end my run because i draw no sigil ok so by now i have unlock rank play be a veteran hearthstone player i choose to create a mid lategame red green focused deck and jump into rank lose my first two match because i only draw 1 2 sigil great i amoff but after i believe my first match i get a premade deck provide to me by the game for play a rank match great seem like a good and balanced deck earlygame focus but with control aspect and card that provide you with sigil awesome maybe this will solve my problem of sigil lack eh by this moment i be severelyoff at rng i go on to play 2 match with this deck and lose both time because i can not for the love of ing draw sigil anyway i go on to play my last placement match for rank with the premade justice deck which i have have luck in the campaign with i also enjoy the aggressive creature focus playstyle of it needless to say the earlygame go great i draw 3 sigil of justice and play them this get me a huge lead in the earlygame i continue to press my opponent he be at around 2 health however through the entire game i have not draw a single sigil and draw card which cost 4 6 power this game mana currency at this moment my enemy have 8 sigil power and whilst i be overdraw on card because i can play nothing he be reactively play and actually engage with the game he drop a legendary and basically pound me into oblivion from 2hp because i legitimately can not play the game i have never experience more consistent bad rng in the game the game need a serious bad luck protection system or provide a better more concrete way of draw playing sigil just realise i have not explain what those be they be a prerequisite for play alligned card in this game like magic land it be a disgusting feeling have to concede game in campaign because you realise in the 3rd 4th turn you be go to lose and then go on to rank multiplayer and realise you can not concede or you lose rank play and getoff because you redrew your start hand into the minimum amount of sigil 5 time in a row and you draw no more and you can do nothing for the entire game obviously my opponent do not experience the same bad luck so this may just be me or the strong deck be those build around 1 sigil requirement card draw 1 power cost card but this may just be me be extremely unlucky so take my review with a healthy proportion of salt if you think i have not provide enough,neg

3672,early access reviewok so what to say about this game first of all its free 2 play but it be not pay2win if you like game like magic the gathering hearthstone or dual of champion you will love this game most of the mechanism be adapt version of mtg mechanism e g hast first strike trample which mean the game be of course optimize for online playing balance the interaction between player card game and the game flow in a optimal way it be possible to interact with card and action the opponent do in his turn but it be minimize in a way to have a good feeling about the game flow it be not that it seem to always interrupt with every action you can take it be possible to play all the game provide without pay any money or invest hundret of hour to get free gold after 2 3 day it be possible to build a free 2 play deck that be competetive enough for the low rank one thing that have to be mention negativ be the force to play the complete campaign aka kind of tutorial which take several hour to get the basic deck of each color and before it be possible to play gauntlet long story short a very good online game for every mtg player,pos
3673,ah classic old team fortress 2 there really just be nothing like it it have team base combat unlockable weapon and most important of all hat but forget about that for just a second what make this game so good the humour of this game be just amazing every class have something nasty to say about each other and you would know what i be talk about if you play the game or watch the meet the trailer teaser series it just make me smile when i hear a line i have never hear before secondly the team base combat as with most modern day fpss with the exclusion of the battlefield series somewhat you do not see a lot of team orient gameplay take for example call of duty it be really just a run and gun experience and that be not what teamwork really be about in tf2 though it really require a good deck of card for you to win you need to work together to capture the control point get the intelligence push the cart and etc it can get rather intense with either your team or the other team try to do a push that be one aspect that i love about tf2 next the unlock drop system with game such as call of duty you need to level up in order to gain new weapon and attachment for your current weapon but with tf2 no need they drop randomly every weapon have its advantage and disadvantage make them virtually balanced either way but do note that these be only side grade not overall upgrade from your stock weapon your stock weapon be just as effective as your new weapon but droppable weapon do have stat bonus and stat drop that your stock weapon do not have every unlockable weapon be suituational to some degree so it be important to plot out which weapon you will use the thing you have be wait for hat while not all that important hat do add some flair to the game they give you customization option to your class which can often result in a rather spectacular look player to not only look at but play as but how do you get hat it be somewhat complicated really standard unique quality hat drop rather rarely but you can get them from unlock crate or trading you can get genuine hat by order a game that have a special compaign that give you the hat for free if you buy that game then there be the real meat of this whole hat thing the holy unusual hat yes they be rare and expensive to obtain but they give you a feeling of satisfaction and achievement once you do get one for the first time especially if you unbox one that be rather hard to do on the first try but hat do not add anything special to the game really same with stranges and killstreak weapon they only track your kill obvious difference be that stranges track your lifetime kill while killstreak weapon count how many kill you get in one life but yes i do recommend this game it be a nice game to play for a few hour and hopefully find something new to do that you never do before,pos

3686,early access reviewnow this game use to be a lot of fun it have a solid economy and pretty much work as advertize you build a vehicle and then you battle it out in different match type you would get reward even more with premium and with the reward currency you could buy new part for your vehicle i be write it use to because the developer decide to promote their premium strong and thus change the economy model to a random drop system this at the begining may be fun but soon you notice that you can not just buy the stuff you need to build your robot you would have to recycle your previous reward in order to get a fraction of their wealth back as robit with which you could buy your desire item then this mean the game have develop away from it be initial freedom and appeal of a building game to just farm a bit and then buy and build what ever you wish into a total gamble you be now totally dependent on luck with your drop and every time you get a loot crate you be offer additional random drop as premium player this basically go entirely against the initial freedom the game be advertize for there be more issue right now unbalanced weaponsystem and even very old glitch they never really get to fix them but the general trend regard this game strongly point towards become a moneygrab there be lot of problem which be solve absolutely nicely before the epic loot update for example since everyone want the protonium crate now people be play also against their own team for the top spot on the leaderboard result in team not play together anymore also seal clubbing have become really common bring high endgame weapon into low lever match to become the topscorer and thus also get reward with the protonium crate that be right there be no difference right now wether you win a match on your level or low level do not matter you get the same totally random generate protonium crate which have the high chance to give you some legendary item in theory but these chance be still so slim it be almost always random crap as well as in the other box so enjoy the game as long as you do but i can not recommend get to invest in it be current state,neg

3729,its trash and p2w great combo play this back 2014 or so when it be in early access and it be pretty good now its just a bunch of kiddy go pew pew and whoever pay the most win the most this game path go down the samer road like hero general be great when it first come out but its p2w and so be this if you want to try it out go ahead but do not get suck in because while building ship be fun whoever have the good cannon and the most of that good cannon be the one to win that firefight just another free to play dumbe down trash game for mindless 5 year old,neg
3730,i do not know about hearthstone as i never play it but i can not help but notice it be comparison with magic the gathering which i play for many year let me start off by say i think this game be really good if you have play mtg than you will notice it be very similar yet with a slightly streamlined style which work very well for a start you do not have to tap card and instead of declare attacker and choose defender this game have implement a sytem where you directly choose who you want your creature to attack this make the game play very smoothly and it be much quick too the drawback this game have in comparison however be that it do lack the same level of depth as mtg as there be less phase to the game such as you can not case instant spell or react to enemy move however what this game do so well be implement a few other mechanic which retain a level of depth which keep the game challenging and engage one of these be the prophesy rune system which allow you to draw a particular card in reaction to be attack at certain stage of the game this system actually allow for a bit of reaction play such as tap down an attacker if they be make a critical attack in the last moment another great thing about the prophesy system be that it allow the lose player to draw extra card which force the later stage of the game to remain challenging for both player another interesting system be the lane mechanic which mean you have to plan ahead which side of the board you want to play card this work very well and add yet more depth to the game as a mtg player i have find it very easy to translate my skill directly across to elder scroll legend the colour mostly play the same roll with a few aspect mix around there be also a lot of the same creature skill but with different name such as breakthrough trample lethal deathtouch drain lifelink charge haste etc although there be no fly esl although have it be own guard system which work well with the way it let you choose attacker give the defend player a sufficient way of protect themselves i have play through the story mode which be really fun and the reward be satisfy and allow for great fully customise deck the soulstone system be great allow you to gain extra card of choice to further improve your deck strategy the arena mode be also great allow you to use ticket which can be buy with real money or earn in game coin and enter as sort tournament fighting against other real player where you draft a deck on the spot from card choice the card art be wonderful and although there be some aspect of pay to win i have find no problem with play my deck against other player and not get overpower,pos

3732,this game be fun and challenging in this game you build a fallout shelter then the dweller arrive at your vault door that be when thing start to become a challenge you have several thing that you need to keep an eye on the first of these be three meter which measure how much food water and energy you have in your vault these be very important you want to keep them full if they fall too low it lower the overall happiness of your vault dweller the more room you build in your vault the more energy it consume the more dweller you have the more food and water they consume the other thing you need to watch for be the happiness meter and the bottlecap meter the hapiness meter tell you the vault average happiness and the bottlecap meter tell you how much money you have you can also bring up a view of all your dweller and view their status which include happiness their job and how they be equip you can equip your dweller with clothing weapon and a pet now the most important room that you will want to build when you start out be live quarter power station water station and diner this will allow you to get the first of your dweller start these room cost bottle cap to build so be careful of how many you start off with right away you do not want to use up all of your bottlecap now will start out with 7 dweller at the vault door you can drag them to the appropriate room and assign them job you can determine the right job by another meter call the s p e c i a l meter dweller have their own this meter show you the dwellersstrengthperceptionendurancecharismainteligenceagilityluckif your dweller be high in strength you would assign them to the power station high perception would be assign to the water stationagility would be assign to the diner more room will unlock as you play each of these room will be govern by one of these special stat your dweller can also produce baby dweller as well baby dweller happiness will remain at 50 until they be grow and can be place in a job to make thing more interesting your vault can have various disaster incident occure it can be attack by raider or infest by radroache or even catch on fire lastly you can send your dweller out of the vault on quest in which they can fine and bring back various loot and bottlecap it be a fun game and more challenging you may think,pos

3734,hour on record for this game and so far it be hold up well enough i have play most of the free online trading card game and this be the only one i have feel like i can stick to and enjoy for long period card be easy to obtain with daily reward only down side be the player base a game every 30 second to 1 minute be not bad but i have fight like 10 different people over and over in the bronze silver ranking all in all it be my favorite so far and i approve of this game,pos
3735,you want a review well even if you do not i be give you one anyways tf2 be not like most fps game let alone one that be free to play tf2 be the sequel to a game know as team fortress classic a mod use the unreal tournament engine blah blah blah historical stuff i prolly get wrong anyways tf2 be quite simply an amazing game with 9 different class each with their own unique role in a successful match 1 scout he run fast cap intel cap control point and push the bomb cart with the power of 2 people warn since he run so fast and have a double jump allow for high evasiveness he s also pretty squishy have a measly 125 base health 2 soldier soldier be a powerhouse hold 200 base health and a rocket launcher that deal splash damage to multiple enemy his rocket jump ability though this take a lot of practice to fully master can get him to the point even faster than a scout 3 pyro the most controversial class have 175 base health medium pace walking speed and a short ranged base primary the flamethrower pyro can be see as the weak class while most newbie would complain to him be an overpowered fire demon here to eat your baby they really just do not know how easy it be to counter her one second though pyro can airblast projectile and extinguish burn teammate by use m2 or mouse 2 4 demoman arguably the most powerful class in the game demoman be here to bring diversity to the game yknow because he s scottish anyways demoman while have the same 175 health as pyro have one distinct advantage the stickybomb launcher this bad boy do 60 damage per sticky meaning that spamme it on a public game make you a bad player that should go back to play minecraft and the hundredth jumpscare game pewdiepie just play 5 heavy also consider one of the weak in the game especially without a medic latch onto him 24 7 heavy be the mascot for tf2 this bald bear wrestle russian giant show none of his ruthlessness in the game but rather the comic_strip which even then he realy kind of do not heavy have 300 health wow you must think until you learn his disadvantage he be the slow and have the large hitbox in the game make him easy to pick off from afar 6 medic oh boy medic be the second fast class in the game just after scout he also have 150 base health your cod wash mind may think hey where s his souper smg ding well that s because tf2s medic be actually here for healing sure he have a syringe gun which be basically a flamethrower without afterburn but no sane medic would rush into a fight like that as he would die near instantly each class have their own way of deal 100 damage in one shot though this be mostly up to crits actual skill instead medic use his medigun a long black healing device that can patch up your teammate wound in second plus when you have full ubercharge you can either have increase heal full invincibility 100 chance of everything your teammate do be a critical hit or a tiny uber that increase your resistance to a certain type of attack and give you health for the damage the person you be heal recieve 7 engineer engineer build sentry dispencer and teleporter sentry will guard an area sit in place wait for some unsuspecting scout to run in and get blast away by ton of bullet and rocket when your sentry reach max level dispencer health and provide ammo for you and your teammate teleporter be capable of send your teammate from one side of the map to the other however all these building require a lot of care as they be susceptable to many attack and will do no damage to stock uber the kind that grant full invincibility and since you will probably be take care of your building and aimbot engineer only have 125 health 8 sniper sniper if play right can outdamage demoman even though sniper only have 125 health he have the long range out of every class what with a sniper rifle and all sniper be the one of the only class that can kill a fully overheale heavy in less than 3 second the sniper rifle be not like most sniper rifle in other game have good aim be essential to play sniper as his main source of damage be get headshot otherwise he will normally do only 50 damage 9 spy spy be a real sneaky rat he can diguise as any class sap building turn them off and eventually destroy them unless the engineer hit and break the sapper his main deal be that he can backstab enemy backstabbe someone be always an instant kill with only for a few exception tf2 be a great game and i suggest you look into it,pos
3736,early access reviewa very nice twist on the genre be enjoy the surprising amount of content despite it be in alpha also be not very good at shooter game i feel like the spell and sword give people like me a chance by allow more way of win than by play like as if it be just an open map mmo shooter i win my first game by play a mage i get all my kill by fly in blow them up with a fireball and hammer them down with a sword this game be literally the only game in which you can do that in the genre at the moment and i hope they expand on the fantasy aspect of it even further have play smite i have a decent amount of expectation for hi rez in expand on this concept further,pos

3738,i do try and tire of fallout shelter back in 2015 when it come out for android as a fallout fanboy i of course click again when i see the steam debut two year ago i get bored of the micromanagement right quick and call it a day this time around i find the game now have quest and quest i have be do for almost the entirety of my 19 hour the game be design to make you buy power up but as thing such as vac ban be hardly an issue here i cheat engine myself 99999 nuka cola quantums and skip any and all countdown some of them would have be a real pain 11 day just to craft 1 theme to get 1 8 of an achievement for example do manage to get all but 3 achievement 100 objective 50 raider attack and 20 legendary dweller be too much of a grind even for someone as pedantic as myself human lifespan do have a limit to them thisll hopefully be the only fallout game i will ever give a negative review to although shelter do get you hooked very well from the start quest be mildy funny and it feel good to score phat loot without hack you would not even have that so unless you be a vampire and do not mind wait for 14 hour for your dweller to get back there be well fallout there be well micromanagement game,neg
3739,i love this and do not even really know why haha it be kinda like when everybody have firbie or when everybody have those digital pet thing back in the 90 i guess the combination of micromanage resource as well as inventory management quest and dweller training management keep it fun enough for me to want to check back in a few time a day for like 30 40 minute to do random crap i play this in beta through bethesdas launcher alot more than i have through steam but back then it be miss alot of the cooler feature it have now like the branch quest and stuff i think that be a great addition and several of the dialogue option i have when stumble accross a random quest in the wasteland be actually well than dialogue option in fo4 at least that be what i think but hey i be just some randomdood who do not know crap about that kinda stuff this game be awesome up until your base get rekt by deathclaw and all your dweller be dead and you do not have enough cap to revive them at that point i think its pretty normal to ragequit and promise yourself you will never play this stupidaddictive game again as long as you still have breath only to return the next day and do it all over again do not ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever pay for the lunchboxe the wonder of pc gaming make it so lunch box be still accessible without pay a dime if that be how you want to play some people may find it more interesting to get everything the hard way and there be absolutely nothing wrong with that just have fun and do not spend your hard earn cash on micro transaction that be completely superfluous,pos

3741,early access reviewfirst off if your on of the people who only give a game one chance that last not even an hour expect a hook to pull urself in then i urge you to wait put the game on your wish list and wait a while atleast till out of early access which should be soon october 13 now if your the kind of person who be willing to take your time with something and experince the growth of a new game then i can truely recommend this game artix entertainment take heavy influence from previous game they make but reach out and pull similar idea from mmo for good or bad the game do not push to be the ultimate flashy experince but offer a true crossplatform system that work wonderfully so you can game with your friend that may not have as beefy of a pc also it be nice just to be able to open up the game for a quick run of a dungeon while on the go as well as a mobile game this be top notch finally i must add how excited i be for the class system so many game lock you into a certain play style and class but aq3d open the door for you to freely move between class though be warn only 3 class avialable not include guardian hence my first point so yeah i recommend this game to people who enjoy loot system and mmos,pos
3742,a diablo clone that have do a good job of keep all the good thing and avoid all the bad thing you will still be excited to find rare item but give a lot of flexibility to change them the skill tree be large but likely only portion of the grid work for certain character there be some room to take back skill point and add them elsewhere gem and socket be a nice touch on how they can be combine and work together the game revolve partly around craft but its not clunky like many game make it,pos

3773,path of exile be one of the good game i have ever play poe be a free to play game but unlilke most other f2p game out there there be absolutely no way to gain any bonus or anything by pay money the only thing you get by pay money be cool skin for your gear it do not have have any effect on the actual gameplay the game be quite complicated but that be what keep me come back for more as there be a near infinite amount of combination of skill and character build most of them with significantly different playstyle while the campaign do get a little old after a while on one character you have to repeat the campaign 3 time on different difficulty grind gear game have say that they have more content in the work that will eliminate this with a new act schedule for release in early 2015 overall i would rate poe 10 10 a must play,pos
3774,early access reviewthis game be what hearthstone magic the gathering would be if they have a baby the tutorial be a bit long but totally worth it because you get 9 free precreated deck you can win easily in this game than you can in hearthstone or magic tg it may be early access but be still fun any how i have not notice ang bug in this game yet some people review that you have to log in every time you play that be not the case with me i only have to create a user name and password once and verify my email be mine hearthstone i stop play because it rely on rng to win this game take skill and patience to create a deck that work for you another problem people have with this game be 1 3 of your card have to be power card call sigil in this game they say it be not good for them because they draw sigil when they want a playable card in this game you have unit spell attachment sigel i get to say this this game be addict i do not mind invest my money in the game when i can afford it you get 10 card in a pack of card with at least 1 of them be a rare or well card in this game there be common uncommon rare promo and legenday card gold be easy to make in this game than hearthstone and sometimes you get multiple reward for complete them like gold individual card and even card pack also dust which you use to create card you donr own in yhis game you can view cards by rarity card type or any combination you want you can have 4 of the same card or special sigil which usely give you sigil from your deck or 2 different sigil for the price of 1 in your deck unless their specific sigil which take up 1 3 of your deck there be 2 currency in this game gold diamond gold you earn by coplete quest or win a match diamond i think you have to buy with real money but i be okay with that because i be invest money in a game that i think be well than hearthstone or magic tg i think it aid in the development of the game i have not find a limit to the number of deck you can have yet i have over 30 some i make some i buy and each sigil type have a level up system which i have not find out what leveling up do card in the game stay the same no matter what level you be but you gain reward achievement for reach certain level there be a lot to this game that keep it interesting and addict some of which you can do for free you can have as many casual or ranked match you want you do not stop get reward when you reach a certain limit either i hope this review encourage other to play it too i hope other enjoy it as much as i do i can recommend this game to newbie or veteran,pos
3775,you do not even have to play on survival mode for this godforsaken crap to undo everything you have build up i start a second game after get a well understanding of the mechanic get an absurdly powerful plasma rifle as my first reward use training room to amp up the stat of my resident and how be i do in a single random group of burrow mole rat make me burn through all of my stimpack and kill over half of all my character level range from about 5 to 20 for an average of 15 or so we be talk about the 2nd weak enemy in the series besides radroaches here i swear on my honor and sanity during that same sequence that make me rage quit i have 1 vault dweller arm with an enhanced sniper rifle that i believe have armor piercing capability i uninstalle the game the second i quit so i can not confirm vs the last molerat in the vault fire about 3 to 4 volly of shot and the the rat still kill him this would seem to suggest that standard enemy can get strong if you do not meet some arbitrary gameplay milestone not that you would know give that the help section say nothing to that effect there be no level indicator for enemy and you also can not get a numerical value for their health or depend on the circumstance even a health bar i assume this because to get feral goul attack in my previous run but i decide to wait on make baby to power level stat this time the final record for how long i last in the game before get royally screw be 3 goddamn day to clarify after the basic have be introduce and your vault population expand new training room that increase stat be unlock this be because the only thing that leveling do be increase your character health but say health increase be supposedly great if the endurance stat be increase but just like everything else in this damn game there be absolutely no way to know what the hell impact it be have let me just go over the thing the game will never let you know the aforementioned extent to which endurance impact health increase the numerical value of the character health the default likelihood of anything happen when use the radio to broadcast in the wasteland or have a deathclaw randomly show up at your vault door what stat if any govern melee weapon effectiveness how close far a character be from build up to a critical attack and with regard to room almost everything want to know to what extent merge room help before spend money too bad want to know precisely to what extent increase training room speed help before spend thousand of cap to upgrade it too bad want to know if the help section aka bethesda be bse you regard training speed go faster with more people in the room well i sure as hell do not notice any difference want to know whether you have the craft resource recipie necessary to make something in the later craft menu before spend thousand of cap upgrade a weapon crafting room too bad even the radroache can be completely absurd get like one stick in an individual room with the aforementioned plasma rifle and it will be dead before the animation or sound of an attack can be hear but have them spawn in a large room far from anyone and 5 to 6 can turn into 10 to 20 for no reason and one of the room be literally incapable of housing resident despite be a location enemy can spawn in and just to put the cherry on the garbage gameplay sundae your little vault minion could only be more incompetent if they shoot themselves if an enemy walk into another room your poor helpless flamethrower brandish uber guard suffer from crippling depression that prevent him her from pursue due to their profound sense of failure to stop them earlier and must be drag by you every single damn time but do not think that it end there melee enemy on the other end of the room can still hit your sniper rifle weilde vault dweller on the opposite side and they most certainly will be on the opposite side because bethesda naturally understand that if there be one thing that a time sensitive resource drain cluster f of a combat sequence need it be for every single goddamn character to waltz over to completely arbitrary location within a room before actually open fire or put out a literal fire and on top of that human combatant will often stumble and stagger for what feel like an eon after loose all their health drag out the time that resource can not be produce for even longer thus put you in the position of sit there unable to do anything but wait as a bunch of drama queen raider drunkenly stumble about harmlessly with your vault dweller be equally passive even as the siren blare and the resource bar flash like it be actively be depleate i know bethesda be hopelessly inept in most respect but i do not think they would find a way to screw up we be give you this for free think that be the end of the bs nope if you look through the help section it turn out that the radio that can be use to attract people to your vault as well as pretty much any instance in which the vault door open have the capacity to bring deathclaw charge into the vault deathclaw and if my experience with the molerat and roach be any indication i could only expect every character to drop dead the second they enter the room never take any damage and somehow fill my computer with malware take money out of my account for microtransaction and give me cancer it be never happen to me but again i only ever get as far as feral goul so it be probably a late game thing with the gameplay be a mindless grindfest the only other possible asset be story which as one would naturally expect from a free game be nigh non existant in term of be a source of sincere motiveation you be a vault and there be people in it the end oh there be quest that you can send vault dweller out on assume that you can spare any of them your valuable equipment and you build an overseer room even after all that you be reward with stare at a travel progress time for hour on end because it can take up to 30 hour likely more since the travel time seem to increase as the quest progress and i think i recall one have a 36 hour time to start with to get to from a location for one mission so good luck try to stay invest in quest that have you sit around do nothing for hour wait for one or two line of dialogue to give you any more story before make you do it all over again and on a personal note the game be an affront to biology and really in favor of the adam and eve story because there be more incest than a southern probably should stop now before i violate steam guideline regard user post before i finish that but the point be there be no amount of in family screw that can not occur in the game the weird thing be that the game actually kind of encourage it with the mechanic no i be serious character name can repeat so it be difficult to keep track of who be relate to who and it take hour for radio call to bring people to your vault if they bring people to your vault that be one of the reason i have only like 30 to 40 character for so long i be try not get parent and sibling to get down with one another but with the way this game present them you would think human be mouse or something anyway that be just a niggling aspect that bother me the more substantive issue be the gameplay i you need a fallout fix then play new vegas again if you have not play new vegas before then my question be what in the hell be you do look at bethesda to make a good fallout game go play new vegas instead i would recommend wastland 2 but i have not play it yet though it be in the same vein as fallout so i guess it would be worth a look,neg

3777,do not read the negative review please read this first this be a very good hunting game as a real life hunter i enjoy the level of realism this game provide it be not realistic in many way but it be not a hunting sim even though i wish it be that be say it be certainly the most realistic hunting game on the market it have a wide variety of environment weapon specie and equipment it have incredible graphic good ai awesome online multiplayer real time competition interesting mission decent skill system with acheivement a photo gallery of your kill and decent statistic track the gameplay be fun while remain somewhat realistic but it do have a learning curve once you understand how the game work you will have a blast the negative review almost all come from people who do not read what they be download they think this be a completely free game without do any research into it thehunter do have a subscription base system and microtransaction but it be not all bad they just update their f2p model and it be more than fair now keep read as i write this review currently there be 10 map 29 huntable specie and one specie of dog you can bring hunting with you when you download the game for free as a guest you be able to access all map however you can only hunt 5 specie for free whitetail deer pheasant and three rabbit species the free specie be on all but one map all other specie require a license that you can either earn by do mission for in game currency gm or buy with real money em you can even earn em by do sponsor deal which i have not do so i can not tell you whether or not i recommend it you can not shoot animal you do not have a license for you be give two weapon 12ga single shot shotgun and 243 bolt action rifle with unlimited ammo and a few other item for free to start your hunting this shotgun be legal for every specie in the game as long as you be use the correct shell birdshot buckshot or slug the rifle be legal for mid sized animal include the whitetail check the wiki for more information between the mission for the 5 free specie you can earn plenty of gm to purchase a host of equipment to improve your chance of be successful and even buy license for additional specie that be all without spend any real money this route should be consider more of a demo to the full game as it teach you about the basic of what the game have to offer once you be convinced that the full version be worth the money you can purchase a membership bundle or subscription subscriber unlock all animal map and unlimited free ammunition for the duration of their subscription bundle be the good value if you be just get into the game however bundle include a subscription and a host of weapon and equipment i would highly recommend the trailrunner bundle 49 99 which include a year subscription and a host of weapon and equipment when your year subsription be end you can renew your subscription for another full year for only 34 99 there be ton of extra weapon and equipment you can buy a la carte with em real money i have spend an absolutely ridiculous amount of money on this game and i do not regret it i love hunt and this be the good hunting game out there you do not have to spend a ton of money to enjoy it though you can have fun for free or take it up to a great time for 49 99 the subscription be fair and necessary because the dev be constantly update the game and add new map specie and other feature even if you do not want to spend money on the game you can download what be a great free whitetail deer hunting game before you go trash a great game do some research on what you be actually get into it be not fair at all to the dev or long time player who want this game to be support for year to come there be a wiki and forum for learn and get involved in thehunters great community happy hunt all thehunter wiki www thehunterwiki com thehunter forums forum thehunter com trailrunner bundle,pos
3778,a good game but it take a long time to wait may as well afk cause it take hour to do something but overall it be a fun game not really pay to win but require a lot of time dedication and strategy on how you would plan to build maintain and survive from your vault and on how you would defend your vault from incident such as the op mobs which sometimes make you feel annoyed when they appear in a sudden like deathclaws radscorpions and molerats,pos
3779,well let me start of by say that this be one of the most in depth rpgs i have ever play and offer a good story with ton of weapon and quest to keep that boredom level down i have spend a lot of time on the game and do not regret a single second i hear there will be a new patch come out that be act 4 which be go to be well than ever just one thing if you really lke this game and wanna finish it like 100 you may wanna spend a lot and i mean a lot of time farming and public party to gain xp and loot 10 10,pos

3781,i have be play this game on another platform in case anyone be wonder why i only have so few hour play this be just my opinion on the game the dev and the situation base on my perspective as a player after month of unsatisfaction and hope that thing would get well i have to warn people that this game be pretty much a scam the game have not receive a proper update in over a year important bug and ui issue still have not be fix problem that make the game tedious frustrating and boring have not be address no new feature be add to make thing interesting meanwhile the dev do two thing 1 they promise content fix update etc 2 every month they release 3 package at 15 a piece that be way overpriced for what they do even 5 would be expensive imo people have be buy these time limited pack because they think improvement be come soon instead the dev just make empty promise they make poll on the forum to pretend that they want feedback they publish list of stuff they be supposedly work on they make excuse every week for unexplained delay they blame most of the situation on the community manager and replace her by someone who just apologize more for delay in other word they do everything they could to save their reputation despite not actually do anyting good for the game a few week ago they also start to lock critical topic on the forum and they delete old topic where they promise more content it be kind of funny i think this would happen so i keep screenshot of these thing i guess i have enough experience with dishonest developer and their money grab tactic to see these thing come the bad they do be that they even ban one of their loud critic and top player from the whole game for racism for jokingly refer to the chinese company owner as our chinese overlord as if it be not bad enough from what i have be able to understand that comment be make in a private discord channel the forum mysteriously become much less critical after that everyone obviously start to worry about their game account get ban for make up reason long time contributor to the community who have special status on the forum acknowledge their effort also mysteriously lose that status after criticize the game and become less vocal about their complaint well recently the dev anounce that they have not be work on any of the thing they promise instead they have spend all their time make the game available in china they say the promise fixes improvement and additional content would come later and they release 3 more pack at 15 a piece anyway the thing be i do not think any fixes improvement or content be come they pretty much lie for month about work on this when it be now clear they be not so i think they do not plan to work on it at all they be probably just try to sell as many pack as possible until the game stop make enough money so my advice do not spend any money on this game it be overprice the dev be lie about work on content they censor criticism and they try to hide the old promise they make the content you can buy be overprice it will take you a very long time to use it due to broken game mechanic and it be very unlikely that thing will ever get well it be one thing when dev make plan for new content but then unexepected stuff happen and they can not finish the work it happen but in the case of shop hero it seem they never have any serious plan to begin with despite say otherwise and that be not acceptable at all you have be warn,neg

3810,pay 2 win game could be really good but battlefield be very sparse and without use a pay account everytime you get kill in battle it will be a long walk back to the point in this time enemy normally have an advantage and cap the point i love ww2 game and be always fair to the p2w model as it can work but this be gear for free player to completely fail if you like ww2 then go ahead and take a play its not all awful but unfortunately you will grow tired of how unbalanced the game be day of infamy would be a well bet if you want some ww2 action in my opinion anyways,neg
3811,early access reviewgermany be way too overpoweredsoviet be way too weakgame be unbalancedtanks be too overpoweredaime sucksleveling take way too longgermany and america have lot of gun and soviet about the half of those gunsgame be not ready to be play yet4 10 maybe after patch 8 10,neg
3812,do you like pay obnoxious amount of money just to experience even the slight bit of an actual game do you like be force to pay for a premium account in order to create an online lobby do you like have the developer pull apart your buttcheek and forcibly remove your hard earn cash from the depth of your then thehunter be the perfect game for you,neg
3813,early access reviewvery simplistic and semi addicting rpg be do sort of run on nastalgia from the orginial aq but it be definitely worth spend some time in to level up if you be play with friend,pos
3814,this be a great game but many people say its p2w but its not you can get pretty much everything in the game without spend a pennie so do not listen to the p2w people they just have not play for enough time they only have the pay option so you can support nk or make the game quicker for you,pos
3815,game consist of luck and random no skill can be use if random give you 5 lvl monster from a start and useless at that point spell and more over if you want good card pray to all god you know and draw cardpack not 1 coz good card distribute among many till your wallet be dry coz gem you recieve will be never sufficient and opponent will almost always have their deck build to a full its ok when you face ai control opponent coz their deck be almost always weak but if there be an event with pvp heh good luck than and i be do with that greedy game,neg
3816,the reasone i do not like wt be the gaijin net agent its litterally a seed in a system since if you delete the game the so call agent keep update it wich will take away your system storage its basiccly malware ofcourse the game be not bad but if you do not want not intentional malware wich be still intentional btw do not install it,neg
3817,matchmake for ground force be abysmal i play br 4 7 6 7 and in about 90 of all game as germany you will be uptiered fighting jagdpanthers with tiger 1s and dicker maxs fight tiger 2s and is2s with e panzer ivs thishas get out of hand gaijin its time to get off your mountain of f2p money and start fix your game for your player you lazy russian s,neg
3818,it be kinda fun at first but after some minute it get rather boring and repetitive not the type of game for people with attention span of a goldfish but if you be strong willed enough i guess it could be fun do not fail to spoop me but probably because i be quite the easily spooped person 4 10 would not reccomend,neg
3819,if you want a flight sim that be not as dull and date as fsx or xplane then dcs be for you however all that glisten be not gold as they say dcs have fantastic visual and great professional flight model and the 3d modelling on the plan be superlative however many plane be still in early access and have be for quite some time and as such be not feature on steam also as many of r hoggit user would tell you dcs may as well stand for delay combat simulator as the standard wait time for a two week release be about a year that be not to say that there be not enough to be get on with just understand that if you be stoke for a new module you have hear about you may have to maintain that enthusiasm for a loooong time before you actually get your hand on the stick also despite the base game be free everything else be very expensive the navada test range and the new module will make a big hole in your bank account unless you pick stuff up on sale two high fidelity plane in dcs will spank you for more than 60 so be aware that while it be a great flight sim it be a money hole do i recommend it hell yes it be superb and enjoyable and the online community be great just be prepar3d to wait an age for new stuff and pay through yourfor it when it finally arrive the game all dlc on steam will set you back over 500 more if you include what be not feature on steam and accessible via the eagle dev dcs standalone,pos
3820,early access reviewi love the idea and the art plus some of the game play but fix some bug and please let us start party and personal server for co op i would love to see this grow but please,pos
3821,pay 2 win basicly sum up the gameto get sub classse payto use most of the stuff u get in starter gear pay to wincoupon in the game u get from starter gear still need to paylittle explanation about some thing but other thing greatly explainedso yah pay 2 win,neg
3822,early access reviewgreat idea have potential but it run like crap there be no graphic setting that make the frame drop stop not even the minimum setting have the fps drop to 5 10 every 30 second and for no reason be incredibly annoying,neg
3823,the good thing about this game be that it uninstalle really quickly i spend 24 minute with it 20 of which be at load screen there be obvious animation issue obvious load time issue and the voice actor definitely phone in their performance the bad thing about this be as a developer i know that the developer know this be bad it be probably a mismanaged project with unreasonable deadline and an underfunded budget,neg
3824,early access reviewone of the good online tcgs ever plus it be so generous compare to the other easy to craft card as well so long as you know what you be do miss event promo craft them,pos
3825,my vote for the great because i pay award this should win because you literally be not sh t if you have never buy stuff in the game everything be base around buy more to be well than other also if you want the first purchase reward do not buy it through steam you need to download the arc launcher and log in with your neverwinter account and buy your stuff through there me and many other make the mistake of buy through steam so yeah pretty pay to win in my opinion well that be just my guess anyway maybe if you have nolife this game for a few month you may have some decent stuff not likely though overall this game be a lot of fun in the early stage but when you become a reasonably high level you can not compete with people with some well item which you need to buy with money or trade a lot of stuff to get that much ad so prepare this game be fun but be prepared to grind a lot if you be a free to play who want to play with the big bois,pos
3826,i highly recommend this game its be a perma death bullet hell pixal game and it play smooth i mean its a great game to come play to kill time if you be bored with other game ton of class to choice from with different ability to slay your foe the game can be a little confusing at first but you start to get the hang of it real quick,pos
3827,so yea the game be free to play however to actualy join any multiplayer lobby with some people in it you have to pay real money so then what be the point what a waste i be actualy look forwards to this game,neg
3828,early access reviewpretty cool game come storm into the steam store around 2 week ago really fun to chill with some friend and still nice with random stranger if you can find the warmth in your heart to forgive its early access flaw you will have ton of fun totally recommend it after you start it be a slippery slope into binge play v some snowflake in the review be tell stuff about malware it be not like that they be mostly troll or player that have issue with the garena release personally i have not find any issue whatsoever only complain would be the random rubberbanding lag and though rare the game disconnecting hang in there dev this game be climb the steam chart to the top for sure 3,pos
3829,defense of the ancients 2 or dota 2 for short be like be addict to an extremely harmful substance no matter how many time you queue for europe west and get russians no matter how many time you get an insta pick pudge go mid to feed no matter how many time you see a bounty hunter build battlefury you will keep come back for that one taste of glory it be an extremely abusive relationship that be impossible to leave,pos
3830,meh it be okay for what it be but its just a shameless cash grab for a quick buck and for any real effort it will take you along time to get even close to anything it be a shame edit the game be actually alright but the customization for video prefrence for some reason make it impossible to play now but the change be kinda cool but still a dislike for the poor versiatility between computer,neg
3831,early access reviewthis should be an example of how one small design choice can ruin a game this game have amazing card design there be ton of way to build deck and plenty of card that be thrilling to open and play eternal have the good drafting experience on the digital ccg market hand down the reason i can not recommend this game be because the standard format be 75 card if you have play any magic the gathering playing rank be like play a game of edh commander it exaggerate the problem of mana flooding and screwing and most game end up be very one sided hearthstone for example have totally remove this experience from their game eternal just can not compete in a ranked experience but if you like draft give it a shot,neg

3833,a much well game than world of warplane one of the good simulator you will find be you can actually use a mouse and keyboard and be awsum would definately have a go if you have not already,pos
3834,early access reviewthis game be basically magic the gathering give the hearthstone ui treatment and legendarie that break the game downside be that probably 80 of my game have those 1 in a million power draw rate like get 10 sigil in the top 15 card or get 2 sigil in the top 20 card thing that should happen occasionally but should not be happen with anywhere near the regularity that they do it be probably the number one thing that kill my enjoyment of the game the game free to play model be pretty generous but you will be absolutely destroy by certain legendary card that be so rare the only effective mean of obtain them be buy the large box that guarantee their drop rate be it worth it i do not know it be definitely get deep strategy than hearthstone but keep hearthstone problem of 1 card making or break a game if you lack immediate removal it be also much hard to narrow down a strategy like you can in magic thank to the high power and high card limit requirement,neg
3835,this game be one of good free game that i play the community be nice and can be social what u know by experience for this game be that it be go to take you a long time to master every class personally i will go for candy barb he be a great starter class and the whole gem system can get u really strong very quickly if u grind and do a lot of dungeon for hour and also i recommend watch twitch live streams bc the twitch streamer give out free stuff like wing and rarelike that and the trade system be huge so if ur look for something u will have to find someone or either buy it the game be a huge adventure honestly,pos
3836,i have play this on my android device and on windows version through bethesda launcher and this be just the good on pc why because it be lag free experience and you can play with wide screen recommend all the way,pos
3837,this game be get a lot of bad review because people see it as pay to win i be here to fix that in the game realm of the mad god there be thousand of micro transaction you can do to get well gear that would take a legit player longer the only difference be when you get the item from actual boss in the game you learn the value of them and how to use them instead of start off with 20 of gear and die at level 15 at least they do not sell stat pot in the nexus for real money that way someone who pay 100 be still not well than a legit maxed character tl dr you can not pay and get a more rewarding experince,pos
3838,early access reviewgreat look game with great idea but some dev who like censorship and tell their fanbase to off other review go into detail about this its also very very pay to win be able to spend money on get a sniper rifle then more money on ribbon to unlock upgrade to make it insta kill be super annoying semi same for a machine gun mg42 sgt44 in particular imo they should just make all gun 1 shoot besides mgs pistol and smgs remove health bar on tank and vehicle and replace them with damage model or section by section health ammoracks turrets hull track engine all with their own hp just seem well for the play style spawn kill be a problem in this game since i last play mid ish 2017 one map in particular where you spawn in as a tanker and within the amount of time it take for your guy to turn on the in game engine the enemy tank behind you can kill you stand out in my memory just over all the good do not out weigh the bad and the dev do not exactly help the good in any way but hey it be free it go ahead and try it,neg
3839,run like straight dogon my 3 thousand dollar pc have to find tutorial to edit ini file just to get well performance but still run like dog i see almost no player to play with and no one respond in global chat i wait a couple year for this game so dissapointing i be hope it would be a good replacement to aion which i quit after 6 year nope guess ill keep wait for pantheon,neg
3840,  warn long post incoming first of all in game description they say thousand of player in my opinion there be about 2500 player active in every 3 5 battle you start notice the same name in the list when i start play the game there be player counter show 13k 15k online player as soon as there be 8000 and low developer remove the counter i wonder why i have play the game over several year about 1400 hour in steam and even before it come to steam i have see many update many hotfixe and nerf i can say that this game be die developer be not listen the community developer do not really know what they be do good example create ton of skin over 1 5 year and yet not a single new assault map developer be ally bias usa su and take thing personally when someone be adresse question about german faction nazis and the big f kup be the 1 12 update the developer rush in unfinished unpolished unreal the last update be the reason for this review till this point i hope that game be get well but i be mistake only reason why this game be still alive be because its free developer fix your game and listen player who have at least 1000 hour of gameplay in their account,neg

3844,early access reviewit play a lot like world of warship in space and i like the different role of the ship and if you have a team that communicate well it be a great experience some ship feel very niche and not worth play if your team just do whatever they want so team play be pretty essential it feel very moba esque but would be nice if they add some more map and maybe some sort of creep wave the good news be the developer seem to take player feedback into consideration tl dr space ship go zoooooom pew pew pew and boom boom boom,pos
3845,early access reviewthis be actually a pretty good game although there be alot of hacker which make it less fun but recently i have notice alot of people turn against hacker and leave them in empty lobby but its very fun pretty easy the poor mans csgo would definitely recommend just beware of hacker,pos

3850,very addictive casual game be play it for a while on my phone have no idea it be even on steam until a friend advise me that it be easy on here then on the app either way i really enjoy it though the quest can get a little frustrating but that be likely more down to my poor planning then anything it be get a lot of resource management quality and it can be difficult to get enough cap to improve your shelter without go on quest or explore the wasteland but the game be certainly worth a playthrough it play like a sim game sort of where you need to manage the dweller and their resource think of the quest and wasteland exploration as job they need to to make money you can get directly involve in the quest as well but not the exploration which could be consider a bit bleh but it be still a pretty decent game and it be free,pos

3856,amazing sound amazing physics up there with ac it do get expensive but this be more of a hobbiest title and not so much a casual mess about perhaps like irace unlike ac however it be playable with a gamepad but really really recommend get a wheel for it a thrustmaster t150 will only set you back a 100 quid and will be well worth it always get update which be interesting for a 6 year old game in 2012 it be early access and be a bit weird to play it feel like race07 with a graphic overhaul however its come a huge way since then and be freak brilliant sometimes i just hop in a touring car and casually mosey around nordsclief just nail through the gear come off the throttle sit back and listen to all the mechanical part of my car whine chirp away while the exhaust spit flame and make all kind of wonderful noise this sim be worth if just for the sound alone very immersive,pos
3857,brilliant game so good that you can fly a dragon only after ourchase 999 gem which will only cost you about 29 99 so not only be it cheap its kid friendly put yourself in this position your kid want to play school of dragon you load it up and let him play it 10 minute later it have crash oh no but luckily it be a in game time which be purposely build the flying be so slow as so kid do not get too hyper do i mention the fact that word like die be block in the chat want a friendly place for your kid,pos
3858,bless online i like the game and want more people to play it but at the same time i acknowledge the fact that it run excruciatingly bad even on a monstrously powerful rig you can hit spot that bring your frame down to single digit overall i like the universe they have here and i be excited to try the game for a couple of year now since it be announce that be say i understand why player be leave so often i feel like the game could easily be save with more attention from the dev more focus on what the community need fix i do not think bless will find its place i want it to but i have a feeling bless be bind for the graveyard sooner than most fail mmo game if you want to try it now be your good chance because i doubt it will be around long i hope some day in the future they rerelease bless as a finished and fix product i think the good thing right now for the game would be for anyone interested to try the game and then voice constructive feedback to the dev make sure htey know what need change,pos

3860,i may be a little biased here but trove be not a great experience for me now i be not say do not get it mostly because it be free for now but when i play it for an idle two hour i get bore fairly quickly sure the world be pretty and i like the 3d cube style along the like of minecraft but the gameplay be repetitive in my brief session i rocket up to the high level rank and it be not even that different i feel no motiviation to upgrade my house or tool or even try out other class also the building block be really uninspired all they have be color primal block and ore at least that be all i find naturally mining be tedious dying be easy and the combat be not polish hey maybe it update and get well since i play and hey maybe some people like this tedious adventure but as for me i do not think i will pick it up again 4 5 10 would not dig again,neg
3861,early access reviewgood game for a casual timepass like counter strike go but free not that great graphic and server lag sometimes also the korean chineese aesthetic in design be not my thing but still fun to play and fast pace action one downside be that most map be too small and cramped and spawn point be too limited,pos
3862,this review will be base on the current time i have with the game 545 0 hour total this game be a lot of fun way back when it just come out of beta and before all of the major update which in turn ruin the game in my opinion i truly love this game from play with friend to just farm by myself this game be a blast although this game be very repetitive the outcome to what you be grind for eventually pay off and you feel a sense of satisfaction but that feeling go away as soon as you see that you have to farm and spend hour upon hour to get anywhere in the game most of the hour that i have log be back before the update of the game where they introduce gem and they start to make item untradable meaning you can not trade them with player and you have to get item yourself rather than trade for them which be a core part of this game since the start of trove i still log into this game from time to time to see if anything be different and to see if i can do anything in a timely manner i do not suggest this game because of the time that it take for the player to get anywhere in the game and the extent that you have to grind for the item that you want,neg
3863,start play this game without realize that it be a cellphone facebook game it be very slow pace with it take hour for your dweller to accomplish certain thing the pace would not be a problem by itself but once you get past a certain level enemy get exponentially more difficult make it impossible to continue to advance without microtransaction and or some actual strategy consider that this game pace at good relegate it to the play during commercial break category the idea of spend more than a couple dollar or put more than couple hour of effort into it be absurd,neg
3864,i have spend a atmatmatmatmatmatmatmatm of time play this game and all i have to say be i have never be so horribly disappoint by any game i have ever play in my entire atmatmatmatme life like most mobas it start out great the game be fun and fairly well balanced and the community be actually significantly well than the notoriously toxic community of other mobas such as league of legend but just like every other game of it be type it go to absolute atmatmatmatme horsecockery first and foremost the company isatmatmatmatmatmatm they do not listen to the community they get countless complaint all over about different thing that be not work as intend or not work at all severely overpower god and game break bug but instead of fix or even acknowledge those problem they tweak a few minor detail once every thousand year that make little to no difference and be typically thing that no one want or give aatmatmatmatmatmatmabout the god be so horribly unbalanced and the less skill it take to play your character the high your chance of win this if atmatmatmatme fact loki poseidon and odin be prime example out of the vast supply of exist god currently in the game i would say there be maybe 20 that people actually play there be far too many instance of god that be just plain better than other and i do not mean counter i mean that there be about 5 mage that be 4000x strong than all of the other mage and this go for every single class not to mention every time they release a god they overpower the livingatmatmatmatmatmatmout of it in hope to get more people to spend money on them i really do love this game when i first start play it and would easily say that at it be peak it be the good moba i ever play but just like other mobas i have watch it slowly decay into the bubblingatmatmatmatmatmatmvolcano that stand before me today i could spend so much longer talk about everything that myself and many other find wrong with this game at this point in time but i realize that i have already waste too much so if you wanna know more reason why you should not download this taco bell shotgun diahhrea game feel free to contact me and i can give you more reason than you could ever possibly need if i have to thoroughly sum this game up in a sentence i would call it nothing but a gargantuan atmatmatmatme time vampire 0 100000000 would not reccomend to the dark lord himself,neg

3883,while i enjoy this game and i will recommend it i feel there be a sharp disparity between the player who do not spend a dime on this game and those who tend to be far less frugal micro transaction run rampant and by no mean be i go to pay money for an item that will probably be lose due to the perma death look at the description hundred of item to discover i think discover mean find throughout the course of gameplay and not pay for how disapointing all say however i will still recommend the game it be fun enough to play and it be a way to quickly and efficiently waste time,pos

3885,early access reviewi have be play since the close beta and this game have be a blast currently there be four different game mode available rank be where you play against other player with a preconstructe deck on a ladder the matchmaking generally work pretty well the only issue i have run into be with some long wait time which a large pool of player should alleviate draft be like rank except you begin by draft 48 card from 4 pack and build your deck from that pool this be a fun game type that also help build your collection since you get to keep any card you draft there be also two ai mode gauntlet let you put a preconstructe deck up against the ai to earn reward and help you build a draft style deck by give you three card to choose from at a time to go in your deck this be another good way to build your collection as far as gameplay go i have really enjoy it my background be in magic the gathering and this game sit in a similar place in term of strategy you can interact with your opponent on their turn and combat give the defender their choice of blocking and how at the same time the complexity be not extreme and the turn structure flow pretty smoothly once you get the hang of it i be hope that dwd will put out a comprehensive rule at some point since there be a few interaction that be not immediately obvious and seem to be inconsistent but those be rare one of the good thing about this game be the community it have some name you may recognize if you be involve in the tcg ccg community be luis scott vargas brian kibler and patrick chapin they be not always on but it be not unusual to run into them in a draft or rank match there be also finkel but he be not the real finkel even though he be great you can see the touch of these player in the meta which feel fairly balanced it be a little aggro heavy right now but that be already shift as people start rebuild their collection they have also tweak the meta outside of a full set release by give out promo card that can be earn by win your first game of the day or craft if you do not feel like compete for it overall i would give this game a 9 10 it be a great game if you enjoy the genre and i strongly encourage you take a look,pos
3886,sadly too much of a pay to win with little reason for non pay player too continue play it there be lot of f2p card game which do not feel p2w due to how to shop work or due to how matching function i do not understand why the consumer should choose this over other f2p card game which be simply more fun,neg
3887,this game could be and would be decent if it be not for the change to the menu as other review have say it seem that they go in reverse with be intuitive but i do not have any preference because i do not play at launch progression be great in the beginning then it become a korean grind fest essentially unless you pay for membership of course the game play be super fun if you enjoy mass ship combat and maneuver large semi slow vessel strategically but it all come down to healing and range as long as you have superior heal you can not be kill as long as you have superior range you can kill before be kill the community for this game be go i have be through dozen of match and it be always the same you be up against a bunch of bot with semi believable name that end up sit still the entire match and you may have 1 player on your team who be real if you be unlucky and the only actual player you be destine to lose good game die way too quick easy progression then grind to a halt for that next piece give it a go at least until tier 3 ship,pos

3892,i just reach 1k hour play on steam before it be release on steam i play it for about 500 hour more and after all this time of play even though i often take a break of a few week i still enjoy play path of exile very much so many option so much unique content such a nice community where there be always somebody willing to help you with your question so many content add update with new expansion unlimited replayability i play this for 1500 hour and will most likely play it for another 1500 hour especially if ggg keep release those awesome update with new league new item new map and perhaps new act the game may be a little difficult to understand for new player but the tutorial the game offer explain the most basic mechanic and thing you have to know to get start for a detailed guide to path of exile i recommend ziggyds path of exile guide 2 0 if you would like to know every detail about the game ps i be always up for some high level mapping feel free to add me ign imnotliketheotters,pos

3895,product receive for freeokay after 570 hour in the game i recommend the out of this game if that do not get you to install war thunder then install war thunder you fool it be a free game so why not well one reason not to be because you will get so addicted to it you will litterally forget the name world of tank it completely overshadow wargaming in every way and now with the 1 77 patch i can safely say it be one of not the good game i have ever play okay i mention why you should get the game now time for the juicy inside scoop of what come after well my freind you have much more than a random number generator with health bar that it be competitor provide this game use a full indepth x ray modular system where every shot count shoot the driver and that tank can not go anywhere until he be replace but be carefull he can still shoot back way better than a health bar now take that idea and expand it to the whole tank then add in differant shell like high explosive that do not penetrate the tank but give the enemy crew a bad headache and bad if the crew be not hide behind armour high explosive anti tank that the germens use litterally oneshot everything and good at range but expensive so if the gameplay good graphic well it be not next gen but u do not need next gen in a competative environment u need framerate and trust me the option always allow you to have a great framerate with great graphic although it will not look that great like modern title if you do not have a monster pc your in the heat of battle and will not look at the small detail when ur panic that that guy over there just set you on fire well do i mention this game be tank plane aaand ship well now i do think of it as a mega wargaming u as a world of tank warplane and warship it complete the 3 battle princaple of air ground and sea and it come together perfectly as in applejack word think of a ww2 simulator game as a apple pie you can have amazing apple and a wonderfully crispy crust but only together can you have a perfect apple pie so it be get ww2 ship plane and tank that all nope there be pre war tank that you start with and cold war behemoth this game span be large time period and when you think you have get a amazing tank it get well but be warn this game be not balance no not in the slight despite gaijin good attempt at the moment certain machine stand out at their rank but just like real life some may say well i agree a little there be a way arround these player with a unfair advantage outsmart them but you can not most of the time so that annoy me too i can not play with freind on this game for long period of time because they get so angry and just ragequit,pos

3902,  counter strike robo offensiveno one like these damn crate it be a cheap pay to win method of suck the fun out of people who be reluctant to fling their wallet at freejam backwards evolution somehow this game seem to remove more and more balance over time to the point of just throw every player they can find into match overpower weapon no one ask forit feel like freejam procrastinate so long they forget they have to make an update so they just decide to throw in a new poorly balanced weapon into the game at the last minute as a sorry excuse of progress removal of mega botsi see no real reason why this be even do it be as if they remove them without know why they want to or what they be go to do from there craftingthis be not an update freejam literally just replace the word in the code this could have be do by anyone who have even take coding class in high school again a lazy excuse for an update while they roll around cluelessly try to figure out why the popularity of robocraft be drop faster than stock price on black thursday removal of armored blocksagain no clue what they be go for here it be fair and balance pretty much a major factor in what make robocraft unique it seem like a good third of my grinding in robocraft be to get well armored block and there they go wipe day of effort it be just too complicated for it be own goodand not in a good way you can jam all kind of new content into your game faster than ever before but that will not make it any better if you do not slow down and put time and effort into it sh t plus sh t just equal big sh t removal on limitation of gun typeslette every bot have whatever kind of weapon they want at any time remove most if not all diversity in robot all creativity and design in my opinion that be most of the thing the community do not like about this game it be very simple to find out what they do not like as several people have do the very same thing i just do statement from freejamfreejam have recently announce that they would be partially fix some of these issue such as the crate and tier they have even state they want to remove all way to buy part with real money this be the first positive thing they want to add to robocraft in a long time if robocraft hold true on their plan i will be more than happy to change my reccomendation for this game,neg

3907,early access reviewthe game mechanic be good and the concept of build your own deck custom tailor to your own play style be promise unforunately once you enter the ranked modus and play a few match the first thing you realize be that most of the people just use 9 5 deck that they look up on eternalwarcry the second thing you notice be that player with legendary card simply crush you in every possible way you already tickle the oppponents health down to around 5 point next turn he draw one of his legendary card and two round after that you be finish no matter what you do i know legendary card should be really powerful but if you encounter in ranked modus tier 3 bronze player with several legendary card in their deck it simply feel frustrating bottom line have no fun at customize your deck for lack of card and the option of simply copy other people deck stillwant to build your deck on your own have no fun at get annihilate by legendary card,neg
3908,overall team fortress 2 be by far my most favorite game on steam or be until 770 hour have be sink into this game it be somewhat enjoyable still and there be alot to accomplish in the game there be 9 class to choose from i can probably main soldier and the trading part have me somewhat hooked as well i recommend the game to anyone who like a variety of mode class weapon and everything else team fortress 2 have to offer you do not really have to strive to be the good just have fun playing that s what video game be mean for be not they,pos

3915,early access reviewblack squad honestly it seem pretty good maybe a little rough around the edge but overall if you be into free to play shooter i would recommend you check it out,pos
3916,early access reviewuse to be good game untill developer decide to follow up with several devistatingly bad update never listen to the community and be now sink with their ship,neg
3917,it be a good game so far who say old game suck graphic be old but that be normal i like it here a little tip if you spend one dollar euro on this game your experience will be well,pos
3918,early access reviewi love the series and the fact that they seem to always make sure that its possible to solo pretty much the entire game that be a huge concept your the hero the person that villan despise and the point of the game be to get op and stomp the badguy in the dust however the game seem to always exploit when your not pay attention or make a mistake and you can still loose as often as you win even the basic enemys can snag a kill on you if your not to careful overall i feel like the game be a great representation of the 2d version i just hope that all teh fun class werepyre be my favorite still carry over i do not think the game need to change i just think the addition of 3d open world sort of feel be all it really need why mess with a game that s already a blast also keep in mind while there be glitch bug thing that do not seem right its a game mean to poke fun at all the stuipd thing video game do that s half the fun of it all,pos
3919,one of the good f2p and fps game out there not pay to win grind to win but that s ok you will not see cheap move like buyable class or race truely massive battle huge map 100 vs 100 and vs 100 be a common thing the good gfx and atmosphere you can find for a f2p game 3x faction pvp system ingame platoon management so much fun when in an outfit guild especially if your leader be able to read the map and develop strategy start as a lame soldier and grind your way to become a leader scout medic anti tank pilot mech support infiltrator carrier what ever you really wish for each individual be need on the field world event for the win able to test eqipment before buy active player and community it be not about mindless killing and zerg rush team play and right strategy be the key word new content almost every month or two the developer really like to develop soe team do good job very very poorly optimize even after all those year of development this be the bad part of the game lag be real sometimes random kid be everywhere with friendly fire solo gameplay be not rewarding and boring after a while you will have to play hundred of hour to be able to unlock those special equipment you want compete with high lvl player be frusturating when you first start the game there be a learning curve for every class gun and vehicle in the game can be confusing without proper equipment it take a while to be actually usefull in the battlefield some weapon be poorly balanced and very expensive thankfully you can test them before buy air combat mechanic be not satisfy despite be so fun it be just so hard other than world event there be no actual quest in the game ghost capping be your good bet at this point no story or plot what so ever not that it need to but still you will have to maintain your connection for 2 hour to benefit post world event reward or else you will just lose 2 hour with one little disconnect so much time consume and so little rewarding sometimes you will not believe your eye so many different enemy player skin can actually trick you as friendly and some player be headless somehow microphone problem which they should have fix by now all in all fun a serious game for gamer with serious ambition yes i recommend this to any one interested,pos
3920,early access reviewive play almost 50 hour and this find that the gun play be 50 luck or connection and 50 the weapon you have i find my self get angry and i die d10 time in a row by air plane and imortal tiger tank whil on one on my team have anti tank its a agrivationg that you can not change you be solider set up mid battle i belive this be do to people be force to buy extra charactor you can not leave change and regoe so when you leave you have to waith 10 miuet waitiong for the battle to finish when you be not in it,neg
3921,you know when a tv show enter like its ninth season and all the original cast and creative team have leave how everybody who actually understand what make the tv show good have be replace by some random studio stooge who be only watch a couple episode and turn it into a big ugly convoluted mess you keep hatewatche that show you be too invest now you have to see the trainwreck at the end but if a friend ask you if it be a show worth get into you suck some air through your clenched tooth wave your hand side to side and say ennnhhhh,neg
3922,early access reviewi have play this game way too much my 5 hour on record be only because it be not on steam prior to open beta it be a card game that take a lot of what be great about mtg throw in a ton of original concept that can only be do in a digital card game and wrap in up in a much more user friendly package than anything like it on the market the free to play model be pretty friendly and the game be very fun,pos
3923,this be a highly realistic racing game that easily beat most other in fun and misfortune amazing for record videoe and competative gameplay why purchase a wannabe game when this beast show you the great experience for free charge you for extra note there be a practice mode for those who do not want to race right away you can get use to the gameplay,pos
3924,early access reviewhag play a lot like red orchestra ii except if the graphic be about 3 year old and it have severe server and hitreg issue and be free to play but approach pay to win and have terrible balance and let us say you just start you be give a semi automatic rifle and a pile of grenade seem not bad the problem come when you realize that that rifle be only semi automatic in a game with such atrocious server struggle to hit and also take far too many shot to kill you can of course buy an smg early on as the game helpfully direct you to at that point you be the god of cqc at least until you be flank by another fine gentleman with an smg but then when you reach level 3 you be throw into the big boy server there you get to play with enemy plane tank paratrooper and sniper and of course the enemy side always have more of whichever be the most problematic for you in my case that turn out to be mainly tank with a side of pesky sniper the tank be hard to fight as a foot soldier there be little you can do to start off there be the occasional panzerfaust single shot in a box which can be pick up on some map they be nonexistant on other they be in location vulnerable to enemy fire later on there be a reloadable rocket launcher to unlock but i can not force myself to play long enough to get enough money for it most map have a lot of open ground which mean tank can spam from hundred of meter away and sniper can pick you off from similar distance the game do not have a ping counter on the scoreboard but i be sure i be get at least 100 maybe 200 ms ping at all time the deal be also sweeten by the fact that everything that matter be serverside there have be many many instance where you shoot a guy and even see the blood spatter but the server do not count it as a hit i can not reccomend that you play it at this point maybe it will get well it be a beta but after see how far it be come in the past two year of beta not far i do not hold out much hope,neg
3925,really cool game i love that you can play this while learn science my only upset be the censorship system and the only way to report someone be to walk right up to them and click their avatar they need a report option in the chat but otherwise great game d,pos
3926,fine pottery be make with clay this be just smelly raw mud it be just a repeat of infestation survivor story and war z just with a new name like a different account for a trial thing if you want something well get unturned very fun and have well feature if money be not an option 7 day to die,neg
3927,a pure grind if you do not spend money you will be underpowered unless you speand at least a year on the game the game be make to frustrate you untill you give in and pay money into it hope for a well game it may be a free game but the way it be make be frustrating if you want a cool bolt action sniper guess what unless you pay money you will be use iron sight and fire off three shot into other to kill for a long time you may get lucky and get headshot but with no zoom and the game in 1080p it make this hard it will get to the point that you feel like assulte the peolpe who make this game sorry for any spelling mistake,neg
3928,dcs world be definitely an amazing simulator it by far outclass other due to excellent flight model a multiplayer that make sense easy to learn mission editor and a large amount of detail even flame cliff 3 aircraft have more detail than something like war thunder actually dcs excel at detail for instance the a 10c it be the epitome of pc base simulator with most if not all of the real plane functionality and flight characteristic another example be the ka 50 and really any of the rotorcraft they basically be the good in their class with the full range of aerodynamic effect you would get from the real thing retreat blade stall translational lift ohmy blade just up and leave me hopefully not irl etc another thing be nevada test and training range it be a huge map most of nevada in fact even some part of california the entire las vegas city and suburb be present and amazing even though it be not out for steam yet as of update i will leave this here,pos
3929,i keep say i do not like game like this i keep say how card game be not my thing and yet certain one will come around and disprove me they will lull me in and a few hour later i be hoooke and this be one of those game i have play 2 hour of elder scroll legend so far so my review be not a review of the entrire game as such but more an impression of the game after give it what i feel be ample time to get a idea of what the game be about the battle themself be a mix of really easy and really bloody hard and so tactic play a big part of card selection attack defend and buff your card to inflict damage but also to keep the enemy away from you i struggle with this take 5 attempt to do the early wolf battle but as sh arp as i feel the learning curve be it make me want to beat it to stick the middle finger up at it and say there i beat you mfer and i suppose ultimately that be what you want a game that be not too easy or two hard but require you to think a little more tactically each time you face an opponent i do see that there be dlc for a free game it be not really an issue as there be plenty to keep you occupied and to be unlock if you be willing to put the time and effort into play it although i can understand if some want to save time or simply have to have everything at their disposal to play with overall a great game and would recommend people at least try it once,pos
3930,a few month ago i would recommend you this game with fly color but not now why the hacker problem be completely insane and out of control about half of all of your match in pvp will be a hacker most people be aware of the disconnect hack where your opponent will make you disconnect from a match when they even have to slightest risk of lose therefore make you lose the match and they win but there be many player also use a modde apk that can let you see your opponent face down card and the one in your hand this be evident when they make really specific obvious play to counter card they should not be able to see even konamis own kc cup tournament be fill to the brim with them and in classic a konami stupid move they disable the ability to report and block people in the kc cup it be like they want to encourage hacking in their own tournament listen konamiadde a report function be not enoughgive the game some sort of anti cheatand let us report people in the kc cup i mean i do not know what the you be think do something like that,neg
3931,this game be awesome because of trading i prefer trade rather than play but playing be interesting too its so good to just go and trade and make profit but there be a minus that the key price be tf2 be too high i think valve need to create new key or something i do not know how to fix the price of key i recomend valve to try to play tf2 trading itself and see problem with it but i would recomend this game because its like trading game and fps game put in one game last thing i almost forget that they should make paint drop for f2p more often because its the only tradable drop for f2p so yea,pos
3932,early access reviewa decent game with a lot of potential but why make battle pass when the game be in early access dear developer do not be ask for crowdfunding if you really need money or make a lot of other thin but not this t of make battlepass es and dlc and patch that be not really test before,pos

3934,  i have play all the fallout game from the main series to the spin off and i have to say this game be rather enjoyable i start play it on my phone but decide to play on the pc because it make my phone die in a few hour i like it because i can spend 15 minute to an hour playing make progress without much effort basically great for casual play i personally have not have any issue on pc but from what i read other have something about lose all progress and save game be delete from my experience both phone and pc i have never lose my save but one time on my phone i have progress lose for some unknown reason during an update it happen i never purchase anything from the store and the proof be in the last achievement i will never get apparently you have to purchase or obtain a ridiculous amount of lunchboxe to get all legendary dweller lol good luck with that i have have over 50 lunchboxe obtain by quest and objective and only have 4 legendary dweller just 16 more to go i guess that mean i need to get 200 more lunchboxe the rng on the pet drop suck too i have about 10 useless pet and 12 useful one get good pet be like find gold bar all parrot anything with damage resist damage wasteland goody healing crafting time and training time be what you want unfortunately rad heal twin chance happiness or poodle persians dalmatians and german pointer can go away because they suck for long term vault as of right now after 100 hour of playing i have 2 persians and 4 poodle and it suck that the rng on my carrier be waste on them recently i figure out that if you open a lunchbox before you open a carrier your chance of get a different pet increase instead of get useless duplicate all the time some of the quest be comical every now and again i do a ah ha at the cheesy joke also some of the quest test your understanding of fallout lore from other game mostly from the main series of 3 do not expect to see stuff from 1 and 2 aside from all the negative stuff i say i like this game if you be look for casual play you will probably enjoy it too,pos
3935,very high knowledge cap require for mastery of the game you do not need to actively trade but it be highly advantagious and encourage no auction house but there be sell thread on the main site and spin off site that work decently well the dev be very active in the game and produce a new expansion that consist generally of new game mechanic meta difficulty that require you to learn how to rise above it this happen on average every 4 month the game be not overly grindy to level to where the majority of people be at if you know what you be do but be extremely grindy to get to max level the good part of that be it be not need to be that high of a level by any stretch of the imagination there be lag that will hit you frequently more or less depend on your char playstyle and that be a fault of the client to server communication but you can help to make it less frustrating by make a macro that type oos out of sync extremely fun to make new build character and actually encourage this behaviour the game be very challenging however it reward you for overcome it be difficulty the only negative i can really list be the lack of an auction house system the lag that sometimes happen and it be very recommend to purchase bank space if you want to be an active succesfull merchant but the price on all the micro transaction be very reasonable and be not game alter ala pay to win lot of cosmetic micro transaction that be really cool if you like that kind of thing,pos

3937,early access reviewwhile not have play the game as much as most other there be a reason for that i refuse to play a game that continue to drop framerate down to 20 30 for no reason at all more on that later on this will therefor be a rather short review the pro visual be opinion base but when the game run like it should it be a blast and look good the combat be entertaining in an mmo where you will do this most of the time this be important option in character creation be plentiful and it be a good system the dungeon i do be fun and well design the con optimization the game drop fps for no reason it do not use even attempt to use the cpu gpu disk or memory before drop the fps far to low this if anything have to be their priority they have to find way to deal with this but sadly nothing have change since the early access launch add new content should be do only when it run well and not before in the current state of the game i can not recommend it if however they find a solution to the drop in fps that a lot of people seem to have then sure i would recommend people to give it a try but due to the engine it run on i find that unlikely to happen,neg

3939,bless online be an example of mmo developer capitalize on the large pool of mmo tourist and people desperate for their next fix the game offer nothing original except for it be horribly do combat system the game launch horrible and the dev have do little to fix the core problem with the game mainly the complete lack of endgame content it be clear that while neowiz may care about the ip they lack the talent and competence to fix it and give player what they need to survive scummy practice and missing feature that be not publically announce only to hide behind the guise of early access if you want an mmorpg to play that will not turn you away with anti consumer method check out eso wildstar or guild war 2,neg

3944,tl dr it be hearthstone but with all personality remove tes legend fall into the same trap so many other ccgs have it be not a game anyone actually want to make so they just take some mechanic from exist game slap some differnt picture on the card and call it a day mechanically it be perfectly functional the interface be clean and work nicely while game flow pretty quickly and will usually take no more than 5 10 minute the single player campaign serve as a tutorial that introcude the mechanic for those who have not play similar game but if you have seem almost any ccg before you will quickly get bored as you be force to play an hour or so of easy game just to unlock the rest of the game as for the mechanic themselves it really be almost all just a copy and paste of hearthstone you gain mana each turn with no need for land or similar you play mainly creature which can choose to attack either each other or the hero you also get spell which be the usual damage debuff and so on and you have extremely minimal interaction during your opponent turn pretty much all creature ability be take directly from hearthstone charge deathrattle etc with the exception of trample take from mtg mtg itself have far more ability so it be clear which game be be copy here you even start with 30 health and have deck with a default of 30 card there be precisely two thing in the game that be not identical to hearthstone firstly the board be usually although not always in single player split into two lane with creature in a lane only able to attack other creature in that lane in single player sometimes the lane will offer different effect but in most game it be simply one normal and one that gies creature stealth for a turn in theory this be suppose to open up more tactical choice but in practice it really just bring the game more similar to mtg by open up a bit more freedom in attack and defence it at least make thing a little different from hearthstone but it still do not bring anything actually new to the table the second part which may actually be original be that each time you take 5 damage relative to your start health so healing will delay it you draw a card this make rush deck slightly less powerful and open a a bit more possibility for comeback a player who fall behind early can end up with a 5 card advantage which be quite a lot in game like this but it do not really change the game in any significant manner relate to this be the equivalent of hearthstone secret which give the sole interactivity during an opponent turn when draw a card due to damage if it have the prophecy ability you can play it immediately at no cost unlike hearthstone and mtg neither you nor your opponent have any idea if or when this will happen so while this can be quite powerful it be extremely unpredictable and impossible to plan around it be at least the one thing not rip directly from another game but it be really not an improvement there be no hero as in hearthstone but rather class that combine two card colour each colour focusse on certain thing such as big creature for red or spell for blue but other than restrict which card you can put in a deck that be the only effect class have if this sound similar to mtg that be because once again it be essentially identical other than restrict you more than mtg do in exactly the same way that many recent ccgs have do the influence of hearthstone can really be see with some of the colour such as yellow focussing on summon lot of small creature and then buff them to the point it could not have be any more obvious what they be copy if they would actually name the token silver hand recruit as for the game type and free to play model again see hearthstone you have single player tutorial practice mode adventure one available so far online rank match and arena pack and arena even cost exactly the same as in hearthstone and you can disenchant and craft card in exactly the same way as a new game it be not really possible to comment on how fair progression be there be nowhere near as many card available as old game so the ability to get a decent number of card early on do not mean much this question can only be answer over the next few month and year as it become clear if and how much money be need to have a decent chance of compete or at least have fun as a new player finally where the game really fall down be its utter lack of character the strength of the tes games have always be in the writing and the interaction of the player with the world the world itself be just a rather generic fantasy set with your standard elf and cat people and so on and since each game have be set in a different time and cover different event there be not really any establish character place famous weapon and so on this mean that unlike hearthstone where many card be recognisable and themed arpound their lore and legendarie be well known boss and important character card in tes l range from generic elf to the legendary slightly different generic elf the lack of animation plenty of particle effect but no actual movement just make it bad instead of drop ragnaros with a big thump and burst of fire you just place a card with a picture of an elf on it if you care about tes lore this game will not offer you anything recognisable or anything new if you do not already care about tes lore this game be certainly not go to get you interested in it it be a functional generic fantasy ccg with mechanic copy directly from other ccgs mainly hearthstone with a bit of mtg and a total lack of any character or anything of interest to recommend it over the many other similar game currently on offer it do not offer new and interesting gameplay it do not offer interesting character or gripping story it do not connect in any way to previous tes game it just exist for the sake of have a ccg with the tes name attach to it,neg

3949,the art be amazing if subdued and subtle and the lore of the elder scroll be in full swing this game live and breathe the elder scroll even go so far as to get some but not all of the original voice actor from the game to reprise their role such as the arena announcer from oblivion this be also a very generous f2p game compare to hearthstone the amount of stuff they just give away in this game be astounding you get a free card for every three rank win and pve win reward you with craft material this game be quite simply one of the good on the market and i can not recommend it enough if you like hearthstone there s a good chance you will like this even more,pos

3952,early access reviewpersonally i love play this game with my friend however in the interest of progression i have a few suggestion for development of the game now i be not an expert or anything but just consider this the thought of a seasoned gamer first off i would like too see more work put in to customize all the character moveset make each one feel more unique secondly the overall movement feel a bit off not bad per se just off a brawler need to be a bit more fast paced than this one be the gravity could stand to be a bit more forceful and a slight increase in character speed could not hurt either and finally the map now i know this be still early access but a little more variation would be nice as a suggestion what about open map development to steam user and a rank system to make the better build map show up more frequently all in all this be a good start but need some more love before it will have the kind of replay value that smash bros do i like this game and hope the developer read this review,pos
3953,rarely write review but this time i really feel compel to do so therefore forgive me if it will be a long one and probably bore short story you should really give this game a true chance without the pregiudice of any review good or bad i be so disappointed to see so many bad review from people that have play this game 2 hour at max and from people that still need to get to finish the story and or get a decent gear this game have potential it be not like every other game out there it give you a true free to play option the in game shop be just cosmetic and you can get the in game shop currency just by play the game dungeon grind and conversion of point in currency there be an anti cheat now that have kill all the cheater the one that be leave bad review i can bet on it you will have open pvp everywhere in contest area of the huge map there be a lot of content if you want to look for content instead of rush end game and complain that there be no content pvp and pve be balanced and the pvp be truly that as most game have arena duel and matchake bs this game have a lot of very well do content but as every game have thing that need to be improve it be your choice you can see only the bad thing or you can see the good one too and acknowledge that nothing be as you would wish it to be 100 the game have performance issue as every mmo game out there the graphic be in range with every other mmo as well now you will need to tweak your own ini file to get the good out of the game graphic it can be annoying i understand that but there be hunderd of guide out there that can help you do it in 5 min and you will need to go into your nvidia control panel and switch the game vram from integrate to dedicate this game mess up badly at launch this be very true but at the same time the dev team behind this game be not greedy as some would love to see you convinced about the dev team listen to the community and strive to improve this game every day keep in mind that the people play the game make the community if the cheater that buy this game want to leave a bad review out of spite i can not say anything more than to stop read at the review and give this game a true chance it be free now nevertheless i will keep buy my premium membership which do not give any p2w advantage to support the dev because this game deserve to be succesful more than bdo own tes o own and whatever mmorpg you can think about i have play them all p s even though most people get refund the purchase of the game they still complain you will have to decide for yourself who be in bad faith but for as far as i can tell it be not the dev team i be just tired of people donwvote game that deserve tho shine while upvote trash game,pos

3976,planetside 2 be a mass openworld multiplayer game where 3 faction battle it out over sector of many different continent use all manor of tank plane and a garage of other vehicle you can take to battle to try elude the enemy i quite enjoy this game but i do have a few thing to note the first of which be that you need a stable internet connection without it you will be miss every shot you take there be certain balancing feature of this game which could be improve multiple time i have empty whole clip onto a player only for them to turn around and one shoot me this be not a massive issue but be especially common for people with pay to win weapon this game be a little graphic intensive i try it on my office laptop at the low possible setting i could it be not the great experience and i still only average 15 30fps i then try at the max setting on a gaming desktop and even though i could easily get 100 there be a slight jutter to the way you play now i be not sure if this be a small problem with my peripheral or with the game but it be a small irritant apart from these little thing i would recommend this game to most people it be a ton of fun to get your friend together and siege a bio lab or even to go as a solo infiltrator good range of weapon and vehicle to have fun with and a generally nice feel while play,pos
3977,fun game but the amount a dlc cost be pretty ridiculous and i be pretty sure a lot of people would back me up on this i mean the amount of money you would have to spend to get at least half of the dlc for this game would be equivilent to buy 5 60 game in some case though it be worth it but the fact they do not really have muchf freeware plane let alone a helicopter,neg

3979,this game be very enjoyable its be able to entertain me for 72hrs so far and other more yet they go on about how microtransaction ruin the game you do not even need to buy anything you can earn all the thing that be be sell by just put some effort in the damned game and feel well about it too although you can buy thing to advance yourself without put much effort into the game which be of course fine but anyhow the game be very fun it be extremely lengthy you can play it for virtually forever lol go around start over kill farming get your character to maxe level which be 20 then go and get potion to upgrade your character be quite an experience you have to invest lot of time into the game and its worth it because in the end you feel like you accomplish something especially since some people just quit because it be too hard or frustrating to lose everything when i die when its fix to the point you lose everything when you die it make it more intruge you actually have some insentive to not just say all and run around like an idiot without a care and to actually play smartly and do thing correct the game be not for all but for the some who it be for you will enjoy it greatly just as i do,pos
3980,early access reviewthe takeaway fractured space have qutie a lot of good potential the graphic be great thank to the ut4 engine the gameplay be something fairly new and fresh despite be base on exist moba archetype i feel that there be enough promise to put my 15 usd on the table after play just a few match it be like homeworld world of tank and lol dota hot have a giant party and everyone get together at the end of the night and this sexy minx be the result the good amazing graphic for a moba title fresh gameplay for the genre intuitive easy to master control unique ship design that feel plausible as real starship some folk do not care but for me that be a huge thing the bad horrible lag issue i be use to some lag but i have have a few match where i would jump large distance from where i be or where i intend to be without use any speed enhance abilite no tutorial and for a game as complex as this one can be at time there need to be a bit more information about exactly how match be suppose to work include as perhaps non intrusive in game tutorial message move next to the point to capture and so on something simple that you can breifly read on screen before it gently fade out i have manage to work out so far you shoot other ship and capture point on the map but exactly how to do so in order to achieve victory be not readily apparent even after read the in game how to play primer which barely have enough explanation to fit on an mtg card there be nothing the actually explain how ship or tech tree progression work either and if you do not know you could upgrate your ship system you will be less effective as you grind up to the next tier of ship however there be one big caveat i will give to my little bit of whine above i do not bother to read any of the how to play stuff outside of the control scheme for my first 3 match,pos

3982,let us get the elephant in the room deal with first do you need to p2p i would say no like any f2p game it will be fast if you pay cash to get a boost but it be not necessary i have see some guy really rocket forward but honestly just pay attention always sell your stuff for the max it can go for on the trade house and you will be fine the game scratch that i want to run an item shop itch and it do it better than most similar game i have play a few tip for new player 1 only spend gem on upgrade slot have a few upgraded crafting slot and quest slot be super nice i would say get 1 or 2 of each 2 fusion be super important it be not a big deal early on but by the time you be in the mid 20 you need it to move forward an upgrade fusion slot will also save you a ton of time and money 3 ah always sell for 10x what an item be worth if you see that item be not sell for that much then use fusion to get the item to the next high level anyway if i go any further in depth i would need to write a guide lol play the game it be ton of fun,pos
3983,product receive for freeearly access reviewthe first thing that strike me about this game be that it be beautiful detailed capital ship glint from the light of alien sun back light from the blue glow of an earth like planet or the red fire of a lava world with undulating roll of magma ooze below it be stunning the game itself feel like naval capital ship brawl from the age of sail only in three dimension and with rail gun guide missile and the cold vacuum of space instead of the sea with fish in it rather than the more abstract control of most rt game this game put you directly in control of a capital ship use wasd plus extra key for vertical and the mouse for aim the ship feel suitably massive and take time to turn this add a tactical element use asteroid for cover as you try to blind side the enemy i really like the three dimensional aspect of this feel like i be battle khan hide in the nebula the ship feel impose and as their arsenal rain down fiery death from all angle it give a satisfying feeling of might there be an extensive range of ship to choose from each with their own playstyle they all capture the feeling of be in charge of a large capital ship rather than a zippy fighter there be however some variation in speed and agility you can expect large ship to be slow but heavy armored and more nimble craft to be weak there be no fighter craft to control some ship launch wave of fighter or bomber but you do not control these directly the specialised ability of the various ship stealth recon close combat etc in game require team base game play in order to succeed the focus be on multi player with the only single player play available be the tutorial personally i would like to see either a story mode or more bot base play in order to further explore the game before face down live player fractured space be a new take on a team base shooter the slow pace and large scale lend itself to a more strategic and thoughtful play style like home world but with direct control over your unit,pos
3984,i will make my review short and sweet this game belong to my favorite genre fantasy iso arpg i have play nearly all of them over the year other may bring nostalgia and pleasant memory but path of exile be just a love letter from the developer to that specific genre personally i think it be the good game in the genre and it be constantly be update and improve the story be great as you discover the tragic history of wraeclast through encounter relic during your playthrough the storytelling be uniqe and it be mostly do through voiceover so there be very little interference in actual gameplay the skill tree be massive and may be intimidate at first so try go into your web browser to the skill tree calculater and mapping out a build and save it to your favorite then refer to it when you level up you gain skill through gem as well as way to improve those skill by link your gem together on your armor and weapon the control be responsive and intuitive and your skill ability make you feel powerful poe be free but not pay to win but you can buy some nice cosmetic item and loot box i get me some glowy eye,pos

4010,the usual reason to play wot blitz be to speed up wait be it on the porcelain throne on a bus or in a queue now i can add just for the heck of it without use bluestacks to my list after 826 battle i have unlock chi nu japanese tier 5 medium tank at 2 british tier 5 tank destroyer su 85 soviet tier 5 tank destroyer kv 1s soviet tier 6 heavy tank leopard german tier 5 light tank i be initially very impressed by other bounce dozen of shot off the armor of the kv 1 and decide i must also have it the soviet heavy tree have be a boring grind for the most part though with the only exception of the t 46 tier 3 the kvs be very slow and virtually blind it be a lottery if you will manage to position yourself for a few hard hit shot and absorb a good amount of damage or you will getatmatmatmatmatmatmatmfrom behind by a leopard within the first 2 minute the kv 1 be incredibly weak until i get the good gun for it cost 20k experience but even now it reload so slow that a single miss can mean i be more of a burden than a boon to my team the british at 2 be the close you get to cheat in this game in a battle where you be the high tier and you manage to keep enemy off youratmatmatmatmatmand shooting at your front you will quickly ruin the other team game it have 203 mm of frontal armor which would be good at tier 7 you be tier 5 you be go to sacrifice speed it be really really slow and view range so you kind of still depend on your team to scout baddie out for you but this be probably the easy tank to steal the show with by shrug off thousand of point of damage and destroy most of the enemy team the soviet td line have be pretty much okay all around su 85 have a nice low profile for hide behind rock and hopefully make the enemy aim a bit too high and miss german light tank require skill a masterful leopard can punch much high than it be weight but it be also really easy to speed into a group of enemy and get kill within 30 second of the start of the battle it be an okay tree to unlock but nothing that exhilirate german tds be quite enjoyable especially the hetzer with it be small frame and very well angled armor plate for bounce off shot even if you do get spot surprisingly the japanese tech line have be by far the most fun for me i choose the light branch ha go ke ni ke ho win 62 61 and 50 of the battle respectively be productive in each battle the tier 5 chi nu be on the useless side start out but also quite good when fully upgrade what make the light japanese tank so fun be that i could reach any mountaintop their small size all stat be equal a small tank be better make almost any bush viable for total camoflague and gun with high maximum depression angle and fast reload time enable me to keep shoot almost every second of the battle shoot opponent be the fun part of wot blitz and the jap tank offer lot and lot of this i think it generally hold true that the high level you play at the more boring it get at tier 6 everyone pretty much a veteran know all the sweet spot on the map and punish any mistake you make harshly battle where you can kill 3 6 tank on the enemy team via snipe cleverly be pretty much behind you by then so i think it be fair to recommend play multiple low level tank instead of focus hard on one why i generally like wot blitz 1 good time killer app i know kill lot of it without get bore difficult or whatever effectively a time machine when wait at the dentist for example2 very short match queue i do not want to queue while i queue3 progress through tier of tank feel good4 at least for now no one cheat almost no one pay to win5 i get to learn tank names6 a lot less of a cl sterf ck than the original wot for desktop,pos
4011,this review be for those who be already familiar with mobas and have play dota 2 or league of legend i will point out what make smite unique compare to those game third person camera perspective unlike the classic smite do not feature a strategic top down perspective and put you right in the action behind your character this allow for much more precise movement and sneak up to somebody do not necessarily require a cloaking ability almost every ability in the game have to be aim include melee and range basic attack that be right if you want to play the ad carry in smite prepare yourself to be completely useless if you can not land your basic attack same go for everything else if you can not hit your ability reliably you will not succeed there be precious few ability in the game that do not need to be aim from the other perspective this mechanic allow you to minimize your damage intake by be a slippery snake and wiggle your way out of tight situation many time i be one hit away from death but move in circle and triangle and wavy line and other sort of unpredictable movement i survive playable character hero champion in smite be real god from pantheon that be once and some still be worship norse roman mayan hindu chinese greek play as zeus thor odin loki and many other god and mythical creature hirez studios do a mostly great job at interpretate these well know deity into detailed playable character and for those deity you do not know there be always a lore section for every god so you even learn something about different culture while you play yay knowledge 5 different game mode one that change every day unlike its competitor smite feature many different game mode aside from the classical 5vs5 here call conquest arena 5vs5 no lane team deathmatch siege 4vs4 two lane small jungle joust 3vs3 1 lane small jungle assault 5vs5 all random all mid 1 lane the mode of the day change every day and feature fun setup like 5vs5 on the assault map and everyone get the same god all of these game mode have their own detailed and well craft map in conquest mount olympus oppose a vulcano in arena you fight in a grand colloseum in assault you defend the hall of asgard from the force of chaos in siege you fight for supremecy in the lush mayan rainforest and in joust you be a knight for some reason it will be change to a chinese themed map soon in addition to that smite feature one of the good deal in a free to play game the god pack the god pack cost 30 and contain every god currently in the game owner of the god pack also receive the new god as soon as they be release forever that mean the more god join the battle of smite the more value you get for your 30 you do the math why should you play smite over league or dota if you love mythology and you like the concept of mobas but never like the top down perspective and ferocious clicking of the traditional one smite will be the game for you it be highly skill base with a very high skill ceiling and many new challenge and skill to master that traditional mobas do not have i play league of legend for 4 year but after i get athritis this be a joke from play adc and kite for too long i give up for me smite be so much more comfortable to play and the fact that i can escape my death and make great play simply by evade and aim my ability carefully really drive me forward in a way traditional mobas never do i will not end this review without point out thing that bug me about smite i be not delusional many skin in smite be lock behind chest which you have to buy with real money currency and by open them you only have a certain chance to get the skin you want it can be infuriating when a cool new skin for your favourite god be announce only to later find out it be in a chest with 56 other item hirez abuse this a bit too much though we have the god pack so that balance it out eu server can be very unreliable quality control at hirez be either non existent or very bad some new god release in a pitiful state either balance or design wise they have horrid animation amateur like voice acting and be either drastically underpowere or overpower some god design be also very questionable sometimes they have ability kit that have nothing to do with their lore or in general be design in such a way that they make no sense do you know the spartans put the statue of ares the god of war in chain to restrain him yeah that be cool but only a small footnote in his lore well what hirez do be base his whole ingame design on that little fact he shoot chain and fire and run around in plate armor with broadsword and shield the shield have a demonic visage on it where the fire come out do that sound like the greek god of war to you not to me but these thing be minor and ultimately do not take away much from my experience i have be play this game for more than a year and only look forward it be free in the end so why not try it out and look for yourself,pos

4031,trove be an extremely fun game once upon a time but many recent update have push it towards pay 2 win gameplay it be a shame that trion could not expand the game while still make it accessible to free player,neg
4032,  dead honest review so i think i have enough time in this game to thoroughly review this game let me start off with the prospros amazing graphic much well than the witcher 3 just in case you need a comparison story rich the quest be very well do and be never the same not even the side quest voice acting be amazing literally the good character design be spot on massive open world game fill with amazing quest character and other player dragon amazing character creation now on to the con con the graphic be sort of demand i can sometimes run it at like 30 fpsthis be seriously the good game i have ever play seriously blow game like the witcher 3 wild hunt completely out of the playing field download this game in all seriousness why be this on steam be not this a freaking mobile phone game or something,neg
4033,early access reviewthis game be great its start out cute and funny and give you the cute jumpscares of cardboard cut out so you feel safe but then it get creepy and i be not spoil it but just download it with out watch video its great oh and its free get now,pos
4034,update as of 25 november everything below still stand true and be still an excellent game i would like to spend a few moment on explain the business model of this free to play title tldr the business model of this free to play be solid you can aquire anything non cosmetic in the game by play it but by spend a few buck you can increase the rate at which you can aquire the thing you want first of i would like to say that you can access all non cosmetic item in the game without spend any real world currency by simply play the game as you be play the game you get xp from do pretty much anything relevant in the game and for every 250xp you aquire 1 certification point these cert be the primary currency in the game which you will spend on anything that interest you except cosmetic that can only be buy with real money however we be now go to look at the thing in the business model that be impefect compare to a completely fair free to play title while a lot of the upgrade and thing that impact your gameplay be only possible to aquire through cert certain thing can be alternatively buy by spend real money such as weapon weapon scope and possibly the soon to be implement implant also you can purchase experience booster use only real money that will for a limited time increase the amount of experience you gain while play the game lastly there be the ability to pay a monthly subscription to the game similar to conventional mmo title and this will cause you to recieve an experience boost as well among other thing that be say the start equipment be all competetive even in some case regard by many to be the good in slot for the experienced player as well,pos
4035,early access reviewthe thing i dislike about early access title be that indie developer never fulfil their promise i know there be a lot of them that be still not complete to this day so hopefully this interesting horror game can final nail it spooky house of jump scare be very similar to one series that be part of the creepypasta universe scp foundation also know as secure contain protect this game have the similar premise of the scp foundation and its a decent one at good these specimen you encounter add nice tension throughout each same room that you enter over and over again even the game mention about it if you read the note that be to get you more invest to the game lore the game sadly do not learn a thing or two from bloodborne and alien isolation which those game refine the horror genre completely yes i be aware this come out at january before bloodborne get release i would have expect the game break free from the cliche that horror game have be stick with in the past i be look at you both slender and amnesia the gameplay be all about run away from the specimen and go to one room to the next you have a health bar and stamina system that it seem its try to play like dark soul a bit in first person the game have no boss battle at all so the challenge be to run away and dig yourself into the game lore you take damage if your too close to the specimen however you can get instant kill by one of them if your not very careful in one room you do get an axe very late in the game but combat feel sloppy at time maybe it will be better integrate at full release sadly the game be not complete right now there be still a few room to go in order to see more specimen and finally know the truth behind this curse house and the company behind it the optimization be bad there be no way to change the resolution or the game do not have setting to make the game perform better you can change the framerate but that about it hopefully the creator will make the game run a lot well than the state its currently in right now visually its not a bad looking game the specimen look nice they have quite disturbing power to mess with you and the sound effect be average at good not much to say about the score its ok for now maybe the final build will have a good credit theme when you reach the one room to get the answer we all want who know when this will be finish so i be recommend this because its free and well despite its disappointing shortcoming the game have potential to be something worth play from begin to end why not let your friend play it or better let some young child play it and he or she will know what its like get their gut spook hee hee hee,pos
4036,one of the well f2p entry on the market for certain the dev take such an anti p2w stance that i be actually really amazed and tempt to spend money since the game not a black hole vortex for it like most f2p arpg have really be do to death and most really be not that different from one another but i feel path of exile really stand out due to a number of innovative approach to old problem level and screw yourself and worthless currency in particular i can genuinely say that i like character progression better than diablo ii it be still do not capture the holy crap moment of diablo ii loot or have the presenation of the gold standard either but it sure as hell do both of those well than the cancer that be diablo 3 only thing i hate be server lag the fanboy crew irrationally blame people internet but it be clearly the game server it only happen occasionally but when it do it be at a level high enough to be quite frustrating,pos
4037,this be a nicely balanced game you can play it in lot of different way from be very active to put in a couple of minute every few day there be a lot of content and plenty to learn so the world keep unfold but it do not pull me in so deeply that i could not put it down whenever i need to,pos
4038,use to be a great community now the forum be a lonely and desolate place many of the great player have leave due to lack of update bug their friend leave lack of response from the developer etc i think it be still really fun for new people just first start out i play nearly 2000 hour 800 on steam 1200 on flash player but for veteran like me who have have almost all of the top ut item and be in the good guild this game have become a sad shell of what it use to be,pos
4039,enjoy play arpg and always push for that perfect loot to make your build the good ever look no further while path of exile may not offer the most stunning graphic in the genre it be top shelf in every other catagory back by a team of faithful indie developer in new zealand path of exile boast bragging right of be by far the good arpg to give you full control of your character custom skill trait and ability through gear selection the ridiculously massive passive skill tree and wide array of skill selection the endgame be addicting as hell always motivate you to push you character farther and farther with improve gear you make your own goal and quickly find yourself grind hour at a time hook on just how far you can push you character into the endless possibility and then you get a new idea for a character and want to try that and so on con less than top tier graphic compare to diablo iii not perfectly optimise lead to slow load time and patch although it be always improve in this area huge learning curve due to complexity of gamefairly large grind to get to endgame for new playerspros endless character possibility that be all viable and rewardingalway better loot to strive for no op gear set gameplay always have variety due to a large number of random event style encountersendless endgame content lot of variety depend on personal preferencegood trade marketability to modify item in almost every way imaginable from your loot satisfy smooth combat,pos

4065,early access reviewi have only play a few hour of this game so far from what i can tell the game need a little work with rendering of people in car and snowboard when move the fps be ok but i would expect to get well fps with gforce titan card what s great the gameplay seem on par with pubg h1z1 if they have a roudy child looting and auto attach of item pick up make it smooth in the first few min to better enguage other player faster shooting and hit register be dead on no desynce that i can see yet the med system in this game be great no boost or special med to get back up to full hpthe strategy map instead of a lobby be awesome its by far the bad part of other game in my opinion but some may like it spawn in at the select point be awesome as well no glitching and take fall damage no make sure to hit 234kph to hit the ground faster than the guy next to you just for you to hit the invisible skybox and get turn in mid air all in all this game need some work but right off the bat if the company can keep up with the demand of its player base and smooth some thing out it have great potential for the first day of ea,pos
4066,early access reviewokay so i have be heavily enjoy this game and i have be do well if i do say so myself the game i feel have a lot of potential and i hope that more people do decide to pick up the game and start play it more than the other standard br game right now there be a lot of pro and con that i can think of for this game but for the sack of time i be just go to list a few pro 1 class selection i think that this be one of my favorite option in the game be give the ability to pick between a paraglider mountain climbing kit and a snowboard along with a free minor weapon setup to start the game up be just wonderful and i think allow everyone to have an equal fighting chance in the beginning of the match 2 weapon play now i will not say that it be as good as pubgs weapon play but i will say that it be damn good for what it be and i hope that a lot more people realize this as well i do think that it need some adjust cause i do think that there be some latency between bullet when fight or just bad hitbox registration because there have be a few not many but a few time where i have dead center a sight down on someone not move and it just miss for no reason at all 3 lastly for the pro map size i feel like this be a very comfortable map size for what have be give to us especially with all the class selection option we get that allow us to traverse the map even quick con 1 sound clarification i have a really hard time distinguish where i be be shoot from there be a few instance where i just simple could not figure out where the player be shoot from because i just could not pinpoint the area of which the sound be resonate there be one major instance where i be be shoot from a house a block down but it sound like the player be damn near next to me 2 minor glitching i do not know if these be just glitch within the game or just game smoothing issue but i have have several match where i die because when i swap back to a different weapon it show i be on that weapon select but in all reality be a completely different weapon the last game that i just play i use a grenade swap to a shotgun and it show that my shotgun be select but in fact it be still my grenade and i feel like this be something that really need to be fix 3 hitboxe i feel like the player hitboxe could be work on just a tiny bit more in my honest opinion for most i feel like its comfortable but as the game move forward i would like the hitboxe to become a lot well and the hit registration to become a lot more accurate that about wrap it up for my review i do not do these very often but this be a great game and i really believe that it deserve more publicity i feel like with some content update and patch that this game could become a gem and become just a popular as fortnite and pubg but that s a long stretch and really depend on how hard you all want to work on the game overall 7 5 10,pos
4067,it have turn so much bad over the last 2 year i join the game before 2014 the game be fun in the begining at first i say to myself well i will wait until i figure out how to play properly before eventually pay some buck for a premium account but soon i get it gaijin just want user to pay for premium vehicle or quick repair prem account without any benefit from it a prem account just mean you can place more badge to your vehicle and get slightly more silver lion after a match in game money to pay your repair if you get shoot that be what i would call free to play pay to win special ammo or repair will cost you silver lion so basically real money if you really be mad enough to play this russian propaganda game be assure you will get affront to the fact that russian vehicle plane or tank be the great in the world no1 one can defeat their armor or aigility be this true i can not find any wiki article that confrim that russian technique be outstanding back in the day it be unreliable and let us say their plane be bad compare german plane that be why i would call the dev liar but wait there be even more gaijin be just announce new stuff which be incompletely develop and balance old issue about bad balancing and bad realism be not correct the only thing you will feel in new version of the game be that russian vehicle be get strong to my mind this game be basically a russian propaganda machine and about the bad issue gaijin claim that there as not no cheater in the game it be not possible they say that everything regard balancing be calculate by the server well dozen of youtube video prove that yes it be true there be cheater so my conclusion gaijin be just another software company with the objective to gain money but in this case they lie to their community in every respect they do not wanna care about fair play avoid cheat or realism do not waste your time,neg

4110,fallout shelter be a great free mobile game that get port to pc fun be aplenty here as you populate your vault with the most capable soul that can brave the danger of the wasteland while make sure they be feed and happy it certainly do not take itself seriously and you should not either it be just mean to be see as a fun diversion with no real bearing on the lore it will help if you have play the bethesda games fallout 3 and 4 as shelter have ton of reference to those two game with some quest be pretty much a trivia contest on these two game no major reference to new vegas unfortunately but i be not surprise it be the same game as it be back on mobile so if you have have your fill already it be probably not worth come back but they do keep it update with seasonal event and it do not look like it will go anywhere soon if you have never try it what be you wait for sure there be microtransaction but you do not need to spend a single penny to enjoy this one go forth overseer and make that army of stampede gatle laser wield comedian you be always mean to make,pos
4111,early access reviewok so datum collection aside the game be pretty good if something good be free then you be the product mobility be nice and diverse glider snowboard and climbing pack big problem in my opinion be the bot the game auto fill a server with bot i would say there be around 15 20 player game out of 50 that be say it be probably go to get well as the player base increase but i would rather wait 2 3 min for a game queue rather than play with bot most queue be around 15secs ai be dumb as all hell and on top of that sometimes it glitche and they just stand there for target practice it be obvious it be not finish and they still need to add a lot of stuff there be only 1 map and pistol be for the most part useless there be no upgrade for them shotgun be also kind of useless as most engagement happen over long distance if you be scared about the game sniff around your pc you can try to sandbox it i guess or in a virtual machine i play it on an hd7700 as an emergency since my regular card blow out a few week ago and i get decent fps for such a large map i have be play it with some buddy and we have quite a bit of fun with some intense moment customization be pretty low at the moment with few clothing item available and no snow camouflage or white item whatsoever mostly dark color apparel make you stick out like a sore thumb on that white background,pos

4115,it work fine as a free to play keep in mind there be some pay wall that although grindable would take many month you will never have a fast mount 60 inc be the base you will never have the good item enhancement yours will be half as good approx it be pay to win do not pvp unless you be pay or enjoy get 1 shoot the game itself have a kind of consol feel about it with only 8 or so spell on your action bar which be player choice but it be not much and get repetitive fast it take about 30 hour to get to max level then due to the daily system for the 4 high level zone where you unlock well gear and hard dungeon it will take a month or two to catch up to seasoned player character role be a bit odd compare to other mmo if you be good you can do the first lvl 60 epic dungeon without a tank or healer even at high level the healer be more for buff the other player than actually keepin them alive i e not a vital part of the team the tank have the same issue with none tank able to go off solo in dungeon it give the game an easy feel with little need for teamwork just button mash you do not need allot of skill to play just either allot of time or more commonly money it be still good fun it be just this game do not go anywhere there be no sense of accomplishment you will reach a point where you do not want to pay real money for next upgrade and the time to get it by grind dungeon mob trading be just too great to be consider worthwhile or at the very least enjoyable,pos

4117,  this review may cover both dota games dota 1 and dota 2 dota 2 in my perspective be just a rework of its original game dota 1 i have play dota 1 for more than 2 year before transfer to dota 2 however i only play this game because i think it be far well than the previous game it be but it be partly not gameplay the gameplay be just like any most other moba game out there that involve communication skill and the ability to play the game itself personally i have be a fan of moba game back then because moba game be quite easy to learn and its fun before move to dota 2 the gameplay on dota 1 be easy to understand because graphic back then be as simple and easy to understand and i get into it pretty fast dota 2 on the other hand have well graphic and the game be far more easy than before in dota 2 the gameplay be short because of how fast pace the game be compare to dota 1 which require right timing to actually execute a good play but they be still the same game that let you farm creep level up your hero kill the enemy team and win not to mention dota 1 need a third party software to play online at least in other country while in dota 2 its just download install and play control dota 2 basically have the same control as dota 1 but it have the option to let you customize to your preference you can now assign different hotkey for every button that you can use for your hero and the menu back in dota 1 all hotkey be quite fix until you use another third party software to modify them community well its like in any other moba game out there it be either the community be good or bad but honestly what really make the dota 2 fall currently be the rise of toxicity among player since the game be free more and more player be create more account that let them play whenever they want if one of their account be ban other thing since dota 2 be a valve software you can actually make money by play the game the game have an inventory system that let you store a certain hero piece of equipment or tool that let you customize those equipment and even ticket that enable you to watch a certain tournament in dota 2 itself i still watch on twitch though with these item that you can receive through game drop you can actually sell it in the community market for steam wallet you can also make more of the item you get by trade with other player also dota 2 have its own workshop which you can visit to check out other gamemode map make by other player in the dota 2 community back in dota 1 you can only download the map make by other certain player in the community also create design new item which can be implement into the game if the propose item be approve by player and the developer final note although dota 2 be a great game it have it drawback specifically the community which make dota 2 itself i mean how do you play this game without player right even so its generally fun especially with your friend dota 2 be hard but there be a huge reward to those who commit i recommend this game to people who like multiplayer moba game i guarantee you its worth it despite the trouble it may bring,pos

4169,early access reviewvery promising casual battle royale look and play like a cross between h1z1 and pubg but the hit registration be much well as tencent be the publisher and developer we have a sort of guarantee of future development but even as an early access title this be very polished and great fun the first person model can feel a bit rigid but the shooting be solid and netcode be excellent there can be a little stutter with vehicle but besides that i have not experience a shred of lag or any bug movement be very tight and responsive there be little else to say at the moment it be an excellent battle royale game it also allow up to four player to win in the form of escape the map with a helicopter but unfortunately many player will not allow you to get out without a fight even when there be only four of you leave and the fear of get shoot while approach the ladder do not allow you to let them approach you while make a run for it yourself but hey that be free for all for you hacker naturally do exist and especially now that the game have go f2p from my experience they be much more prevalent in the squad gamemode than in solo,pos

4184,overall a good game i would recommend to anyone look for anyone who d like a little more action in their moba as compare to dota 2 and lol smite camera and ability style allow it to put player more in the action and therefore have faster pace gameplay while not compromise the strategy and depth of item in a character build pro excellent character selection 85 and count all with interesting passive and active ability pretty consistent update every other tuesday with patch note usually release every other thursday friday free to play anything that matter can be unlock through play the game actually have some pretty beautiful graphic and view especially since every map be inspire by some sort of mythology have more than one map see p s too long to explain herecon because of the amount of item absolute newbie can find it difficult to pick up i do some god may feel unfair to new player especially anubis or loki with practice however both be merely nusiance community can be pretty annoying especially in rank hirez will sometimes unnecessarily nerf god or item to the point where they be unusable but they usually do a moderately good job of bring them backeverythe consider it be a fun game that be best enjoy with a couple of friend to queue alongside you and help one another through discover and learn the build meta of each role and god p s the game have daily login reward that grow with each sequential login assume you login every day for a week you get something like 1 2 dollar worth of the game pay currency gem which seem pretty damn nice from my experience with other free to play game,pos

4189,planetside 2 in it be current state with the current development team have no focus or incentive to play other than farm cert in which to unlock more weapon battlerank be not a measure of skill but of time spend in game squad and platoon level play be useless in the game with its current scale as large outfit will redeploy quickly to hold off an attack with no way to delay or intercept their reinforcement take and hold a base be meaningless outside an alert and the small number of continent and ease of redeploy mean ultimately that fight only occur at the extreme end of the scale either ghost cap no one to fight or zerge oh god my frame rate be 5fps grenade and rocket be not be render and my shield be not regenerate this could have be an amazing game but i fear the community for it will be long dead before it will reach it be full potential,neg
4190,have spend some time around the various racing sim i can say this be not the most realistic not the good look and not the good feeling force feedback sim out there but currently it be my favourite the game be free but you have to pay for content like car and track consider that you probably will have a few favorite ride and some favourite place to race you do not need to buy everyting and with that in mind the pricing be reasonable just buy a point package and get the content you be interested in to get everything you have to spend a significant amount of cash but it be still cheap than play iracing or something like project car assetto corsa with all dlc consider the amoutn of content that be available now for the game itself the graphic be good though not mind blow but consider that you will be focus on turn that wheel and operate the pedal you will forget about visual fast the sound on the other hand be the good in the market hand down handling be fairly realistic though not hardcore difficult like rfactor 2 with good force feedback once configure properly though it be possible to enhoy the game with a controller a wheel be highly recommend now for the sweet part contrary to other sim there be a good combination of car and track you will not see stuff like 1 car per class or useless roadcar that go slow and spin out all the time no ferraris and sls amgs no drift this be all about racing and racing be good the ai be one of the well one so you will not get divebombed by crazy maniac all the time and the difficulty set will accomodate player of all skill level not the good ai in the market but quite good and most of all fun the bad stuff no night racing or rain not really a big deal since in other sim these type of race a cool to look at but mostly hard and frustrating perhaps the big issue to me be the lack of a dynamic racing line where the track rubber up in place where car drive and you have more grip there not really a problem but once you try something like this in rfactor 2 you do notice it other games raceroom also lack open wheeler and do not have many classic car but that be to change soon another thing be a full flag rule system be still to be adde at some point all in all of all the new generation of race sims raceroon seem most fun thank to a good selection of car and track and good ai if you be look to get into simracing this be defo the game to try other sim may have well graphic or laser scan track but not the ai racerrom have nor the amount of actual racing content we see here,pos
4191,early access reviewafter about 180 hour of enjoy this game on and off and realize that the good part be impossible to grind for i think it would be a good idea to put some money into the game as much as a full prized game actually to finally get more out of it i enjoy the component the rng give me for my money but very short time after there be a server error that cause me to lose item have put money into the game this be really offputting but it would have be bearable if there be any support but after multiple support request and also make a forum thread in the official forum there happen nothing so my verdict be enjoyable game if you do not mind never get the good component but do not put any money into it until it be a stable game,neg

off windrunner but the fact hi rez have be inspire by its rival be not the real problem the problem be how smite feel when play which translate to purei will list the problem in the format of problem reaction to highlight the attitude hi rez have show to its fanbaseproblem smite have always be plague with too many bug by a moba standard more to the like of a close beta despite supposedly be a full game with crash packet loss fps drop client crash ram overheatings and every variety of visual bug especially on featured gamemode often follow by afk penalty despite be innocent reaction everything have be shrug off silently blame it to the one suffer and the problem persist since releaseproblem the toxicity of the community and you have my word i play both lol and dota 2 a lot overwhelm the one of the two colossus put together with afk at the fountain intentional feed voice command spam chilling toxicity with death threat and heavy insult this be amplify to ridiculous level when play conquest apparently the vietnam war due to the treatment to newcomer which cause a vicious cycle of people not learn due to toxic and toxic insult noobs because of people not be allow to learn not to mention the hilarious be sarcastic here matchmaking that have yet to find a fix on any rank bronze with master be a common antic by hi rez reaction hi rez ignore these claim never update their report system which be useless unclear and non function and many member in the forum have show no empathy in the various forum as such you can be as toxic as you want because you will never be retaliate against this be a thing that be also abuse through voice chat which should you be this stupid to play this game i suggest to deactivate it in the option forever aside from those two problem there be also intricate one like balance and marketing system there be not an agreement about what criterion smite use to balance their game however there be many proof of how many break mechanic have be keep in and how release god be always overpower like the infamous case of bellona and artio for champion hasten fatalis and frostbound hammer for item or even skill part which be simply ridiculous like bacchus insane value despite be a guardian odin rework ring of spear not have counter until last season or more recently sobeks invincibility when use the ultimate as for the marketing smite apparently seem to have get away with the lootbox method for cosmetic which seem to be defend as right because they be cosmetic meanwhile 80 of the skin be bar away from direct purchase and be lock inside lootboxe with many and much useless garbage item create and put ad hoc to lure the whale to spend lot of money money which do not improve hi rez braindead decisione the average be 60 item and a roll cause it be gamble after all be worthy 200 gem the real money currency pve mode adventure and skin be always the main focus smite want you to grind endless hour or give in and pay incredibly expensive bundle which in many case they give only a small part and force you to give more money like the infamous da ji ratatoskr event as for skin you can bet they be go to give to mascot neith and bellona the most skin and will completely ignore most of the roster for them leave most god with mediocre recolor and outdated crap or in the case of zhong kui almost no one despite the continue vexation by reddit plus there be the shameful fact patch live stream be make on facebook and not on twitch or youtube and those for the 90 of the time elapse be focus around skin while in the precious 10 of the time god balance be talk about but the commentary be very stupid hype base and hint at a staggering ignorance of the commenter about how really those god will feel like the nerf buff or tweak as for the gamemode availaibility only an idiot would deny hi rez have no regard of anything but their conquest also one of the main reason it feel like be in the vietnam war and keep arena and joust just because the playerbase be already decay if by any chance you like clash or siege then you will also know that hi rez have project to delete them aside from the obvious scream by them at you to play conquest with the event which to further worsen the situation be extremely costy the skin despite look sparkle actually hasparticle and voice pack and be lock behind many other with the same problem the mission to complete them very often force you to play conquest and run into the problem i already list be the most cpu intensive hi rez free gem and favor gift on login have always be a very good excuse to defend the game and a precious weapon of the company to make you illude yourself they be generous but when you consider what be these gem for especially if you be f2p you will notice it be not really like that but most importantly be the base of an old system take by lol which have be revamp completely and which dota 2 can not have since they have every hero therefore make all of this an old attempt to give themselves good publicity and aside from that the grinding be really immense and the founder pack seem to be the only solution as for the queue time those often have problem of be delay by an alarming case of people not accept it be even long than lols and dota 2 fuse together on the positive side smite have do some noble thing like the booster and the level up bonus however those be really suffocate when consider the massive amount of selfishness by hi rez lastly the advent of new game to catch up with the trend instead of fix the already ill fate game with even more grievous bug in every new installment be the ultimate factor to the aforementioned sentence as such this game do not retain anymore that addictive factor that once have and with the leaving of bart and kelly it be pretty much over dear reader if you have red this far and you be undecided about whether to download this game or not know how reverse psychology work you be free to throw yourself in the bloodbath but if you be willing to follow a suggestion from someone who have waste too many hour here play another moba there be no well one everything be valid but smite be simply garbage like rust and battlefront ii this game have insult many player pay or not pay save your time for game of high quality,neg
4215,tl dr at the bottom how should i start this off well this game be a free mmo hack n slash type game with a large skill tree and many build character you can make to destroy your opponent with when it say free it truly mean free the only thing not free or micro transaction be the trail certain mask as well as storage so in my opinion that really mean it be free because you be not force to buy anything to do certain quest or to proceed in the game it be a well rounded hack n slash game with very unique clean combat the skill tree be complex and a build guide be highly recommend for all new player it may seem a little extreme the first time you open the skill tree when i first see it i want to run away and hide under a rock but it be really nothing to be scared of you will be meet with people in the chat talk about 6ls and unique weapon and weapon with certain stat etc the only real learning curve to this game be ask people what it mean or use the poe wiki which for new player i would say be extremely helpful get this though i do not know everything about this game at all i be still learn a ton of the mechanic and the function of certain thing pro free to play complex intriguing passive skill tree all around great game extremely addicting and worth the download actually free to play do not have to spend money to pass quest no membership con a small learning curve than will generally take about 8 9 hour to learn the more intermediate stuff some great guide on the internet about it tl dr version great game amazing skill tree actually free to play so what be you do here go play it,pos

4234,early access reviewthis late update be the bad patch i have ever see for this game this pass idea be horrid just create a shop curreny like league of legends no need to remove normal crate with basic item and tiny chance at high rarity item in the shop you can put all item some shop only one that be more special or something i will not put any more money into this game in this state and will more than likely play something else go forward,neg
4235,i be sorry but if i want to buy a hunting tag to go hunt i would buy a real one and take my real gun track and shoot a real deer and eat it the concept be great i have no issue with the technical side of the game however the execution be terrible i download the game instal launch it be a little miffed by the launcher i sift through the game list and find 2 server i be allow to join seriously there be some kind of restriction on 90 of the server finally get in one server after 3 try spend a good amount of time track a nice white tail buck aim fire pop up say something like hey we notice you try to kill a white tail dear you need a white tail tag i be like alright that be cool you need tag then i see the price in their weird currency and the rate at which you buy them with real money yeah free to play i see then i see the mission and tutorial and think cool at least there be a way to earn in game currency to buy a tag to shoot a deer in the face wrong the tutorial do not count toward the mission what really so you have to buy tag with real money basically then use those to complete mission which reward you with a fraction of the cost of the tag right this have to be some kind of scam right like how dumb do they think people be uninstalle never instal again,neg
4236,grindy unique interesting visual constant update customizability massive playing area many active and helpfull player and staff bad thing small level gap between player you can not play with them until far later in the game sometimes poor direction with objective possibly too complex for casual player take time to understand game mechanic overall fantastic game and i have not even be play for a while,pos
4237,i have play this game for around 2 month now and have thoroughly enjoy it it can be a bit of a grind at time but what f2p game be not it seem to be a much fair and overall well version of hearthstone which i also spend many month play you get good value from the arena the story mode be something special which i do not see in many other card game and the rune system make it possible to win even when behind if you get some prophecys overall would rate it a solid 9 10,pos

4240,early access reviewi could play this game for hour just snowboard down mountain throw in the fact that it feel less sluggish better optimize and faster pace than pubg well i be sell my only major gripe be that at long range in which a sniper should still be effective you will see player stutter along their path rather than a smooth running motion this make long range battle a headache when this occur if they can polish this up i will be 100 satisfied with this game the hour of fun its bring me so far have reignite my love for this genre and open my eye to the mediocrity we have settle with for far too long rip pubg,pos

4248,early access reviewhold on hold on understand this game be in early access which be barely an excuse for the poor state of the game its very poorly optimize and will barely run unless you play with with the ini file alot of translation be also trash and i find the control clunky until i figure out a way to get a controller to actually work while make a toggle button for right click to rig an action camera on any class my god be it better this game tho its fun and its pretty even for the engine its art design npc and player make character look damn good the world be big diverse and nice to look at the story when you understand it have charm and to me be interesting the combat feel familiar but with a fun system to make it much more enjoyable while also be flashy impactful and fast pace this game have potential and can be great and just what i want a good mmo but it need some dev love attention and a mountian worth of optimise this can be a gem or it can be forget please do not force it to be forget offer advice and give the game a chance to develop more and pray the dev listen they be try now and ill definently check this game regularly,pos

4250,have one of the most fun combat system in an mmo i have ever play be constantly update with seasonal mod that introduce new area item and quest and have a very active population i also really like their f2p model and it be very viable for one to play at a competitive level in term of gear and pve at least without pay real money just by grind daily and seel item in the ah overall i find neverwinter one of my favorite mmo out there even choose to cancel my wow subscription over this game,pos
4251,early access reviewnow i be probably slightly biased because i play the original adventurequest and dragonfable back in the day but i truly love this game this game be build with a centeral focus on broad accessability both in how easy the gameplay be to pick up on seriously even the most novice level gamer can master the basic of the games combat movement and quest in the first hour or two of play and the mercifully low system requirement do not have a dedicated gaming rig with a top of the line graphic card a solid state drive a 3 5 gigahertz quad core cpu and a funky liquid cooling system no problem this game could run smoothly on a modest netbook the humor be goofy light hearted and full of fun pop culture reference the art style be cartoonish and vibrantly colorful and the overall atmosphere of the game be one of fun and joy and you can not help but smile at the goofy monster and silly pun it be just easy enough to get into that it serve as a fun chill game for experienced gamer between more hardcore title but just challenge enough that young kid and more casual gamer will get a decent challenge out of it as they learn to play their class and climb up a difficulty curve that expect player to master the game mechanic but do not slam them with insane difficulty spike out of the blue this balance between challenge and comfort make aq3d basically the gaming equivalent of in shell roast peanut delicious and satisfy with an acceptable level of challenge to get to the good part and the ocasional bonus nut in the shell when you least expect it if you like me play the old browser game back in the day you will feel a rush of nostalgia when run into the old familiar cast of npc and will really be amazed at the job the team at artix entertainment do when bring the old 2d flash world of lore into the third dimension sure the graphic be not as shiny as final fantasy xiv or black desert online on the high setting the game be mean to be playable on both pc and mobile device with the side effect that it be easy on old and less powerful machine too but there be a ps2 era charm to it that just feel natural for the aq universe the music and sound be decent nothing to write home about but pleasant to the ear and situationally fitting character customization be simplistic gender hair style include main style and braided side lock eye color skin color and start class you can not switch your character body type yet hint weedle but you can switch their class and outer appearance in game and their gender on their character page on the game website the three class you can pick in the begining be warrior mage and rogue but with a one time payment of 20 you can unlock the guardian class which include the class and unlock a new area and special armor just like the other game in the aq family this be an aq game you can pretty much expect that down the line you will be able to turn your character into a werewolf or vampire and the next level of class and dual wielding for rogue be already be try out on the game test server sadly this game do not have multiple character slot available though so if you be go to re create one of your old character from an old aq game or an original character of yours in aq3d make sure you choose your favorite the combat in this game be simple tab targeting and currently you be mostly stuck fight one guy at a time even if more than one guy be attack you they be work on aoe attack capability though so that be go to be fix eventually as simple as the combat be though it be also fun engaging and surprisingly tactical learning how to play your class be key to success and survival and woe betide the player who drop their guard while fight regular mob a little too close to where an elite enemy either be or be likely to spawn no look this game and you will die a lot as far as the community be concern the population be pretty healthy you see a lot of player online all over the place and folk be pretty friendly in this game i be guess it be because there be a lot of long time and return aq and df fan play who be now in their 20 and 30 and it be a relatively lay back non competative game overall which breed a more friendly and colaborative atmosphere there be plan for some kind of pvp in the game however so let us hope that it be implement in such a way that it do not encourage ganker to prey on low level player or turn certain area of the game into bad neighborhood where you can not go 5 minute without some over eager brawler just spoil for a fight pop up to bother you with an impromptu and totally unwanted duel sorry if i hurt some feeling with that but i really do not care if your king fu be well than mine i be just here to grind mob explore the world and hunt for treasure some people see the possibility of random open world pvp as incredibly fun and exciting i just see it as an annoying interruption like the morning alarm clock go off at the climax of an amazing dream i want pvp player to have fun too though personally i think a karma reputation and bounty system should exist to deal with player who like to jump out and pvp people at random all the time too many attack especially on player below your level or repeat ambush on the same player and your karma reputation get so bad that there be a bounty get place on your head and other player can hunt you down to defeat you with no consequence to their own karma rep reguardless of their level to claim the bounty the good part be you can not see your karma rep score and you and people on your friend list can not see your name on the bounty board so you will not know that there be a price on your head until it be too late once your bounty be collect your karma rep be reset to neutral pvp people can still have their fun maybe more so as a subculture of bounty hunter develop around the bounty system and pve people will be happy knowing that eventually that annoying ganker be go to get his so yes i recommend aq3d i recommend it to fan of rpg of all kind i recommend it to anyone who play the aq family of browser base game back in the day i recommend it to people who have never play an mmorpg before i recommend it to hardcore player look for a chill out title i recommend it to people with old or less powerful machine and i definitely recommend it to people who be young at heart and have a silly sense of humor if any new mmorpg today have any hope of be a wow sized hit it be aq3d,pos

4254,a good card game i know it be a bit cliche to compare it to hearthstone but the mechanic be very close so i think it be only fair to make some comparison very close to hearthstone in term of gameplay which can be a good a bad thing a few interesting mechanic when you lose health rune break every 5 damage and you draw a card so it balance the game when you be get stomp or you have only one card to play in your hand prophecy card can also be play for free when rune break two lane each with their own playstyle which make for interesting strategic choice card can level up not during gameplay i mean permanently upgrade it feel more fair and less rnj than hearthsone but still not as fair as magic or gwent generous when it come to give pack and resource to craft card a campaign with some cutscene and a solo versus ia arena mode it be free if you like the elder scroll universe or not try it out,pos

4312,racesim the people who make this game have they ever really drive a car in real life i do not think they have i have both on road and track and car do not behave like that i have play racegame since i be 10 year old i be 35 now and this may be one of the bad one yet when it come to racesim anyway and there be something wrong with the control there wonky or something can not explain what it be but there be something seriosly wrong with them maybe its well with wheel and pedal but with a gamepad it suck free 2 play more like a f2p demo i do not recomend this game,neg
4313,early access revieweh with the game be in early access i pretty much expect bug etc do not get me wrong i do enjoy this game but this game need quite a bit of improvement first off we need well server or at least be able to see what the ping on the server be i be annoy with enter in to a server and it lag quite hard on me time to time and go back to smooth etc what ever you do do not aim down your sight i experiment with it and when i be aim at an enemy with my iron sight right on the person just to see all my bullet fly up in to the sky shoot the roof of the building so you may as well just shoot from the hip if you get shoot in the head with any gun pretty much you will fall over dead every time so if you run across a hacker aimbotter there be go to be no way to exactly even be able to get enough time to even kill them besides the fact this game have a spawn kill element in it though on the bright side at least it be not p2w and you get a large variety of gun but you just need to be able to get plenty enough kill to earn the money in order to have the gun you want as my personal favourite be the asval so despite the lag and spawn kill element the game can be quite fun and possibly have potential in the near future so i guess i can recomend it i atleast have a lil bit of fun on the game,pos
4314,creativerse be a fun way to massage your creative muscle and make some awesome model my hope be that soon they will be make working model such as vehicle that actually move weapon that really fire etc etc the mechanic seem to be there good work team keep at it,pos
4315,feel like i be cheat use the steam vers of this game so i be go to play this how it be ment to be play and that be by smartphone those who play blitz on steam and the window 10 ver be just make a poor excuse by play this version against people who be at a severe handicap i say remove this from steam and get rid of the pc user base off the mobile ver all together there be a pc version of this game and it be ment to be play on pc not this the only reason for this to be on here be to encurage the pay to win aspect that be not present in the pc version and increase their profit gain not bad for them i agree and i understand why they do these thing but its not right to mix mobile with a pc user base hince my digusting 63 win rate at almost 2000 game on this new account alone and a 53 winrate on mobile,neg
4316,i just want my gem back i still like the game also from a business point of view the more gem people have the more likely they will spend money so if they want an ur at 2 copy and their gem get a single copy they would be for more willing to spend money for the second copy if they do not have enough gem to even get a single copy they will not spend any money do konami even do market research,neg
4317,early access reviewi do not see how this game have any less rng than hearthstone 75 card in a deck more incosistency in draw plus mana flood screw which mean it be not unusual to draw nothing but mana 5 turn in a row or do not draw a single creature in your aggro deck for 10 turn if you be ok with watch your opponent play while you can not do anything because you get screw on draw this game be for you it be a shame because it could have be so good,neg
4318,frantic flashy and fun this game test your relfexe and skill as you make your way through the realm of the mad god the aim the aim of the game be to level up accumulate load of fame and to defeat oryx the mad god like i love this game because it be fun and a good challenge it be also surprisingly fun to play with a friend the guild system be well design and easy to use run dislike while their be a few fault with the game there be main problem number 1 it be very flashy and in your face especially in the godland so if you have get epilepsy i would not advise go to the godland if you want to get this game number 2 you have to pay to get anywhere in this game summary overall i would reccomend this game but only if you be willing to pay a little bit there do,pos
4319,this game do not really need any review it speak for itself for eleven year already and get only well with time whether you want fight enemy trade item capture point open crate push cart wear hat or even create your own stuff there be a place for you so if you be still outside of the most fun you could possibly have online it be time to join,pos
4320,first off i want to say this game be amazing graphic be amazing gameplay be amazing there be some bug here and there like bird glitche in the sky after be shoot animal get stick in tree and rock but what game out there be 100 perfect it be a money grabber for sure item can get pretty expensive if you want to hunt more than guest list animal every week they have two new animal add to the guest list on a rotation so it be not the same animal forever i prefer classic over cotw because cotw be more of a arcade with ton and ton of bug if you want something to feel like a true hunting game this be the one to go to,pos

4323,overall 3 5 not terrible but well off play a different card gamepros great elder scroll taste various mode to play story arena vs you still have plenty to do against ai not too difficult to get into you can choose to play it completely free story mode offer many reward have two lane neat prophecy system that allow you to draw a free card when your health pass certain interval you can draw certain prophecy card give you a competitive edge or turn around a tradecon story be not fantastic about average so be not really worth play for story just gameplay have same card effect as other card game just with different label ex divine shield hs ward es l life link mtg drain es l a lot of content be lock behind level will explain later feel like a lack of card the starting card deck be majority of all the card less to offer compare to other lead card game such as hearthstone and magic when a compete card game should attempt to equal or surpass in other way just overall this game just start to feel a bit bland after a while due to lack of wide diversity of card material too similar to other card game and level barrier yes i be aware that as a card game it should feel similar to other pre exist type but it just match too much the main difference in this be image the two lane which sound neat but do not add a whole lot of change and the prophecy system rant one of my major complaint be what i be call level barrier a decent chunk of content be lock behind certain level you need to reach to unlock it this be understandable to a certain point you should have enough experience with this to play more advanced stuff but be just overuse certain starting deck helpful to new people be lock behind need level or progress in the story arena mode also require even more progress and level although it do make sense in respect to the story there be also card that start off fairly bland no modifier that require you to reach a certain level in order to upgrade them this sound cool but think of it like this you get a new rare card that have limit ability since you be not a high enough level the game make these upgrade card bad with their craft system soul trap just like dust in hs by make it so you can not soul trap them until they be upgrade to explain if you do not want a card you can soul trap it for material to make card you want since you can not soul trap these card many be legendarie worth more material you will hold on to them until you reach a high enough level to finally disenchant to make this bad people can get actually craft the upgrade version of the card meaine if you be to pay or play way more to get more card you can craft upgrade card which you would get by playimg more and level up it be just a dumb idea in general i would prefer if they do not include it anyways that be my rant game just do not compete to other of its kind thank for read etc,neg
4324,awesome yugioh game you can get card pretty easily as they be very generous in give out gem definitely not pay2win the pvp be very active so you should get a match in no time lot of cool event where you can get gem and rare card the grind be a bit annoying but you can auto duel most of the time constantly be update with new pack event character and more community be super helpful and friendly most of the time highly recommend for yugioh fan and card game enthusiast,pos

4341,early access reviewi do not know a virtual card game company could be so kind that you actually get to keep the card you draft imagine playing arena in hearthstone except you get to keep the card you pick dire wolf make blizzard look like satan win in this game be pretty easy since i have a strong magic the gathering background and i have rank very fast in both draft forge and rank if you do not like eternal it be because you be come from hearthstone and do not know how to build a decent deck without blizzard hold your hand with class limitation try use your brain for once instead of your cash and get this game,pos

4353,early access reviewthis game strike an exciting balance between the complexity of game like magic the gathering and the accessibility of a game like hearthstone i be a huge fan and have gladly put money into this game to support it be development though you definitely do not have to in order to build up a collection even with three total set out pro easy to get start accessible to new player provide good f2p value it may not seem like it at first but once you start roll through quest and do gauntlet and then forge and gain rank in those you will realize how much the pack and shiftstone craft resource add up over time short queue i play at all hour of the day because of the mobile app and average a 20 25 second wait time in both casual and rank this may change as you get high mmr strong community there be a tournament series et and some pretty great community website the official discord server be active and the website rng eternal and eternal warcry be great to help out with determine which deck to work towards draft actual draft you pass a pack pick a card pass a pack et cetera barrier to entry be low skill ceiling be high when you start build a collection this be actually the most efficient way to collect card assume you have master both gauntlet and forge already simply draft all the rare and build the good deck you can after that sometimes you end up go 2 3 win or even more which be just ice on the cake since you keep your card and get the value of open 4 pack strong playstyle variety i be not talk which deck be tier 0 1 i be talk about the different style of deck out there you can comfortably play aggro deck burn deck midrange deck combo deck and control deck there be viable list out there for all of these playstyle there be even option within those option right now there be a control deck that play zero creature there be also one that rely on develop control of the board and then drop an overwhelming force of high value and hard to remove creature con the tutorial be e long honestly just power through it it suck it be way too long we have all do it and it be not fun but once you finish that and all the mode and option of this game open up to you it suddenly become worth it operate on a mana system like magic this mean you can get game where you get flood or screw game where you draw nothing but power or do not draw any power really feel bad to lose deck size be high this be debatable and lsv one of the designer have stick by the decision to keep the deck size at 75 for construct it introduce some variability to the game and make it hard to consistently draw the answer you need,pos

4377,early access reviewwhat can i say about brawlhalla fun and entertaining as long as you be play with your friend and not go to play ranked to get the high rank on the leaderboard while use experience from any other fighting game i will be talk mainly about mechanic and the game in term of competitive ranked match someone metione it already but i just have to write about this dodge and wall camping be mechanic that basically hinder the pleasure that can come from play this game dodge be mean to allow you to be invincible for one attack and to have a big cooldown however it do not work like that in a practice people find a lot of way to give themselves low cooldowns on dodge make them invulnerable to most of the attack and all of what they will be do be stay passive for the whole match and punish you for the approach wall camping be another thing that can raise your frustration to the level where it be twice the size of canis majoris google it up i take a guess that most of the people will think i be talk about people camp on the edge of the platform just to finish the enemy when they come nearby the wall of a platform well if you be one of those people you be wrong wall camper be people that hold on to the wall like their life depend on it they will be annoying with you by stand on the platform for less than a second just to come back before it be even bad because they do not have to stand on the platform because the wall be all they need to recover the jump dodge and recovery attack but one update force wall camper to start stand on the platform but it be still not enough to fight this plague however there be a glimpse of hope for rank match developer be work on new mechanic and change the exist one dash be go to be introduce and dodge strongly nerfe dodge will have big cooldown and the duration of it apart from that there will not be anything like momentum dodge dodge that can be do right after land a hit or when run full speed and because of that chain dodge series of momentum dodge that can be do by press dodge button shortly before the finish of the first or second dodge be also go to disappear in place of them dash be go to be introduce and hopefully it will punish the passive float people from do so unless you want to play ranked like me and spend some time read 463 hour play it just because none of your friend want to play with you i recommend it to you it be perfect when you want to play with your friend game part of the family or ffa because there be almost no possibility you be go to meet people that will be passive,pos

4389,this be a wwii fps combine with rts general side it be free to play and if you do not mind grind to get well equipment and you like wwii then this be the game for younow firstly let me tell you that it be a release game but the server can give you a high ping at time also the dev be continue to add thing and update the game ok that be say the game be very fun to play but the grind be long and hard to progress but i feel its worth it if you enjoy this type of game and the era it be set in if you do decide to play hero and general it will be a big learning curve on the forum because there if not a huge amount of game instruction that go into detail so you learn as you play right so now you know what your let yourself in for so let me say that spend 15 on this game will enhance your play and fun 10 fold so have a good look at the game and expect to spend money if you want to progress at any reasonable rate and have more fun do it otherwise i hope you like to grind and grind hard the dev show their face now and again which be nice and patch seem to be come out at a steady pace but server do go down quite often due to update and teethe problem when you start to play the game be play on a partially set out worldwide map and each town and city as to be fight over at the moment you have to choose between american soldier german soldier or russian soldier once you have choose your side you can not change until the war be over between them on the general map so to win the war one team as to take a set amount of city throughout the world when the war be over you can then change side if you wish when you start to play you can buy multiple soldier and equip them with different weapon and you can the change fron soldier to soldier while in a match to suit the battle that you be in the battle that you fight start off in training match that quite balanced for the learner amongst us but later on after rank 3 they in be equip by the genral on the map they may put tank against infantry so as in real life not all battle be equal and you have to use your whitts and team work to win all in all this game be the most fun ever and its free to play and be a must for wwii fan but it can be very frustrating due to the game not be as good as it could be because its still be develop but imo its worth give this game a try,pos
4390,early access reviewthis game be amazing have play aton of ccgs list of one i play include hearthstone duelyst elder scroll legends faeria mtg deck hero pokemon shadowverse and probably a few more i can not think of off the top of my head the point be i really enjoy ccgs and have a lot of experience with them and in the short time i have play this one it definitely feel like it be in top 3 ccgs duelyst be number 1 still it seem to be very f2p friendly give you a couple deck to start the game with you get them from do the campagin and honestly those deck be not bad as well it give you a fair ammount of pack early game and give that pack contain 12 card a lot more than usual that be also huge plus with game mode like gauntlet give you a really good amount of reward especially give that it be free at first get at least a good enough amount of card for a reasonable rank deck seem very doable hell even with the one it give you at the beggining i be manage to win ranked game consistiently and there be just something about the gameplay which make me want to keep come back more so than other card game thethat mana work more like mtg rather than hearthstone or simmilair card game can be a little annoying as it can you over but also add a little more strategy to the game for example since when you first draw they be always on the left hand side of your hand if your opponent play one from the far right side of their hand you can be certain they have a lot more and therefor not much else and it be little thing like that which make this game one of the well ccgs plus it also add some freshness to the game so that you be not always allow to play your 4 drop turn 4 and you may have to adapt to use some cheap card to combat with plus with the attacking let your oponent decide whether or not they want to block and with card not be able to block if they attack the previous turn it also add some strategy in that you need to know whether to attack and go one offensive or not so you can defend all in all i give this game a 9 10 for be one of the well ccgs,pos

4401,early access reviewi play magic the gather about 15 20 year ago with a couple friend never get in to it because i be not go to spend an absurd amount on card see this hey its free and think i would give it a try from the free perspective the local content be pretty easy go card and how everything work be not too difficult to understand even for someone like myself that have not have the opportunity to play these kind of game much the causal game against other player be also reward you start see some ingenuity and come up with your own as well make thing interesting once you start rank game i do pretty poorly some of it be luck of the draw and of course bad discussion due to lack of experience no doubt the complexity of the card and people play multiple race color deck make the thing more difficult to understand an example of this if you an enemy unit card 2 2 and yours be 2 3 you know your unit will win so you would choose to attack or defend with it after you execute that action card come in to play to buff their unit or hurt your unit and you lose your card without you know go in course the same could be say for the other team just know go in your go to need to practice and gain experience i play for quite a while have a good time i have like 5k of gold but there seem no where to spend it to advance from here and get well card and build deck it appear its pay to win on the ranked side of thing if your look for something casual and free the causal game this be a good pick good replay value ill no doubt enjoy revisit play casual game if they implement a system to be able to grind the card and deck such as be able to use the gold you get from win then i could see my self play a great deal more i would do a one time payment to buy the game to gain access to everything everyone else have if you be not in to microtransaction and play to win the scope of how far you can go be pretty limited but you can obtain casual entertainment out of it for free my motto be if its free its for me,pos

4424,i really can not recommend trove it be a massive grindfest and little else there be a lot of variety in visual but the core gameplay be extremely basic and if you play for 10 minute you have see just about all the game have to offer in gameplay mechanic there be an absolutely silly amount of cosmetic to be find and i can appreciate that they be largely cosmetic for example there be hundred of different mount but there be only ten or so that be truly unique in some way and those unique thing only very rarely give a gameplay benefit all the hat and face and weapon be randomly generate and you can wear any style you have obtain previously over your equipment so an ugly hat with good stat be easily cover up however all these visual do not solve the main problem with the game that be the awful power creep and scaling issue progression have change a lot since release but basically at this point you be go to be open rng lootboxes hope you get good gem that push your power level high enough to get to the next tier of content so you can get well gem to get to the next tier etc until you get to the last tier and content end not that there be new content at the last tier or the three tier before it since the game recycle all the content it have through all tier tier really only mean how big your number be the enemy and gameplay do not change many class simply have the playstyle of point at enemy hold m1 tap m2 1 when you have energy tap 2 whenever it be available with nothing more than that it get old fast and have to pay cash or wait for extremely rare drop to unlock new class be the pit plus because the game have be run so long the economy be set in such a way that buy endgame equipment from other player be far less expensive and strenuous than make it yourself you can spend day try to find and collect all the material you need to level up your equipment or you can just buy it from someone else i spend week and several thousand flux try to build up my gear myself and i get to where the stuff i need to make myself strong be unobtainable because i be not strong enough yet that be some bad design when i finally cave and go to trade chat it blow me away how trivial it be to just buy what i need rather than go through the design method to make them yourself i mean trove be just minecraft with less building and a mmo skin you can mine and craft and build but nothing you build really have purpose the cornerstone aspect be nice being able to have your own personal chunk of land you can teleport into the world and i have sink many many hour into decoration but it be all for cosmetic purpose i enjoy see what other people have build and there be so much that people have build there be guild world that people have clearly spend significant amount of time building and there be so many people play that you can always find something new that someone have build i would say trove be a childrens mmo it be simple it can be fun but after a while the fun dry up and only the grind remain it be more of fast paced and exciting than minecraft be but that be not too hard to accomplish if you really like minecraft and want something similar trove be a decent pick but it be just so shallow it be a good game if you do not want to think too hard,neg

4441,fractured space have evolve rapidly over the last year and thanbkfully the developer have eliminate nearly all of the glitch and fail connection issue in the matchmakeing system the game mechanic be well balanced and it run great on most mid level pc platform the controll and strategy have be make easy to grasp for beginner but remain complicated ehough that hardcore guy can get invest in them pro fractured space be a qnigue concept at the time of its early access launch the orbital science fiction elemest and arcade phisics esssentally add a z axis to what would otherwise be a naval combat game the simplicity of naval combat simulator have incresse recent and fractured space initial idea be appear on other game like world of warship that say its still an uncommon idea that add a waft of fresh air to the steam market the typical initial learning curve be about an hour and the system match you with bot in initial multiplayer match so that you can practice gradually introduce live player who match your skill untill you become compeditive the typical match be about twenty minute but there be no cutoff timer so two good team can go at it for a ling time with the long match i have ever play last just over thirty minue con there be no single player campign plot or story to contectualize event in this game at all something it would greatly benifit from give that crew character with name and face have be think of alongside a lor of concept be that be include in the interface that show a lively world that we really do not see any of this be clearly a world that could easily have these element but i have hear no mention of them anywhere the turd in the carpet for me have always be microtransaction system because they be manipulative and nearly always result in game that require rediculus and protracted economic in order to unlock everything these game almost always have random number slot machine dynamic that keep you from only buy the thing you want and these game be in a near constant fight between the non pay playerbase that demans balance and the pay playerbase that demand a good reason to pay for extra fractured space show sign of this fight in its game store in that you have two entirely different kind of object for sale skin and modifier skin be cosmetic change to how a ship look and modifier be crew implant or booster which change how a ship perform in a give match you get a starter crew but no implant which mean that player who pay for implant early on have a performance advantage over player who do not crew and implant can be earn over time but a long long long time have buy into this early i have about half of the crew need as i have play new implementation of the game economy have gradually increase the amount of time between crew unlock dramaticly the problem be that the effect crew and implant have be minor to the point that an attentive free player could theoritically outmaneuver or out strategize a pay player which make the varous pack they offer kind of mute even when they have be on sale i struggle to find a reason to buy them because i can not controll what implant i get in the dedicated pack and crew pod can give out the same crew over and over in which case the crew get autotrade for dna one of the three available in game currency its design to make it exponentally more difficult to unlock the last half of the available crew option i can recommend fractured space overall but new player should understand that they be jump onto a treadmeal that seem to get long with ever update one which have alienate me as an old 90 era gamer and one which the young generation seem all to eager to accept as just the way it be i still play and i still have fun playing but i get irritated every time i finish a match and get awarderd what little earning each match give me as a vanguard player it take over a month of frugal in game currency save to afford the large implant or crewpod pack in game for free the thought of that alongisde the constant reminder of how you could just buy platnum and get it now almost mock me because the economy be make so that you have to buy platnum in tier that the random content pack all fall between so you have to buy more platnum than you actually need in order to buy the pack themselves if developer what to have microtransaction fine but please have an unlock everything option available so that people like me know exactly what the maximum possible spending amount be and can choose to skip all the randum number bs also just let me spend real money off my credit card for exactly what i want to get in the game if i want to gamble i will drive an hour down to las vegas and hit the slot at least then i have a chance however reomte to walk away with actual money,pos

4476,early access reviewi hardly ever write review but i feel this game really deserve it so here go i have over 800 hour in pubg well a few of my friend keep badger me to play roe and since it be free i cave in eventually and decide to give it a shot i be incredibly surprised at the experience i have end up with i pretty much completely stop play pubg the quality of life change such as auto equip attachment onto weapon and when you swap a weapon the attachment go with it be huge also be able to choose one of 3 loadout to sort of cater your movement around the map as well as carry capacity be a pretty sweet edition but overall my favorite part be the end game a chopper fly in once the map constrict down to a very small block due to an encroach storm on this chopper there be 4 seat leave meaning there can be multiple winner some will rush the chopper and hope to not get shoot down while climb the ladder while over will have save up a lot of med and wait til the storm roll in and fight out the last survivor so they be the only one leave overall this make every match feel pretty unique due to the low visibility at the end at the helicopter aspect overall i highly recommend this game especially since it be free i can not wait to see what be in store next for this game,pos
4477,you guy need to fix the rank matchmaking duel to improve the game first of all sometimes it be not quite fair how do i always end up duel with high rank player 15 straight game with loss result i know how you win the duel be base on your deck but in this game higher rank it mean the player have so many option when it come to the deck than the low one second the server i know you guy want to connect us all but when it get laggy several problem show up i maybe end up lose my connection to the battle while the other hand my data run pretty well it be pretty suck and the most annoying part sometimes i get a result with i surrender my self to the battle while i be obvioiusly do nothing with the surrender option,neg
4478,i recently decide to give this game a shot have not play an mmo since guild war 2 shortly after its launch i be not go in with incredible expectation i have hear quite a few complaint about pay 2 win trapping as well as balance issue within the game but be willing to go in with an open mind the character creation be puzzle to say the least i in part already know i would be roll dice to create a character but the question be why make the player sit there and reroll dice over and over to get their desire stat roll when you could just let them choose instead roll for stat make sense in a in person pen n paper scenario where you get one shot at them otherwise there be absolutely no purpose except to waste the player time or to negatively impact new player who do not understand the mechanic then come the intro cinematic it be jarring to say the least i understand not every game give you context in it be begin cinematic but this one go out of its way to avoid any context whatsoever on top of that the motion and emotion of the character in the cinematic be jar i would say this be not due to poor animation the animation at the very least seem adequate but instead seem to be due to a complete misunderstanding of how humanoid creature interact with the world yes it somehow look that akward i be willle to push through despite the previous reservation i have due to friend and reviewer alike give it negative feedback as well as the poor first impression i have already receive from just the intro cinematic and character creation but then upon enter the game world i be bombard with admin notification that flood both my chat log and also pop up on the very middle of my character screen what be these message you may ask they surely must be important for them to be so jarring as to completely remove me from experience the game and try to gather my bearing right no in fact they be not they be message spamme to me by the admin about people open lock box chest and receive rare item these message be not only on by default but they can not be turn off or disable in any shape or form both the jarring text that pop up and completely break all immersion as well as the spam in your chat log you can not even make a separate chat log for just specific form of chat guild party etc that will not be spamme by this as it be on permanently in all chat log you create that be pretty bad right but they have to make a buck right well certainly okay so then if i spend money on some sort of subscription open a few box or buy some sort of premium one time membership then you can disable these message right no you still can not this my friend be how you do free to play wrong the pay 2 win be strong enough in the game already but then for them to shove unremovable message all over your screen that be there whether you support them or not this prompt me to immediately close the game and uninstall every shred of it i could find on my system i waste two hour download the game register an account and patch it but hopefully i save someone else some time and frustration if you value immersion fair f2p game intuitive character creation and story i can tell you from the very brief time i spend with the game you will get none or very shoddy version of all of these for context i do not get into a single battle before i end up uninstalle the game but i have over 20 message about player xxx get the everlasting hydra mount of smite flood my screen in that time,neg

4489,honestly i love many part about this game but i can not overlook a couple thing about it tldr path of exile do not value your time if you have a carreer or family or anything else in your life poe be not make for you you would have to spend thousand of hour to get to play all the way through the game and that be horrendous in my opinion a game should be fun challenging and rewarding force people to pull the lever on a slot machine be not real difficulty their main goal be to keep the carrot dange in front of you and you will never ever find the game you want it be all about the chase and at the end you will have nothing to show for it what i love 1 the customization be super deep and very enjoyable 2 there be lot of activity to grind and feel like you be make progresswhat i hate 1 you will have to trade other player will do their good to rip you off it be a job to become knowledgable about the market so that you can properly price and trade item but invest hour pour over page of item price will not make you good at it some people play this game for the economy and enjoy trade and become stupid wealthy to them i say fine enjoy flip currency and buy out item to inflate price i will go play ssf except you will never find the item you need and you can not craft endgame item for a target build so either learn to love poe trade or play a different game hint play a different game 2 crafting be so absurdly expensive that you should never try it it be deep but you will blow every single currency item you have before you see the item of your dream you may be able to accidently craft something other people could use but then you have to find out what it be worth and trade it or play ssf and never see the great item you want to make your obscure build work 3 gating content behind rng so breach spawn randomly and then they drop a random number of shard and then when you finally get 100 could take 15 50 breach no joke sometimes they drop 2 the breach boss have an rng chance to drop a unique item they do not have to drop which be suppperr frustrating take me month to finall run a breach and xoph drop nothing be crush in ssf i can not just run it again another example be uber atziri i have never fight her i map fragment drop randomly and there be no recepie to trade them up so you will be wait for midnight fragment to randomly drop then atziri have a random chance to drop fragment for her more difficult version and again you will never get the rare fragment you need another example be shaper i have never fight him because i can not get the map to drop in order to fight him i have play over 1000 hour in ssf and still i be miss some of the shaper fragment sustain tier 15 be impossible i can sustain 11 12 but past that it be random that if you get the map you need the more map you finish the less likely the map you need will drop infuriating as all hell never fight uber elder or even red spawn elder not because i can not kill it but because i can not get the map to drop to kill his guardian why be prophecy weight by rarity you will get the same 10 prophecy that do nothing over and over again you will never see the one that you find exciting plague of frog and lose map forever smother tendril ughso basicallllyy it be a cluster of rng on top of rng it be a slot machine and all the skill in the world will not help you 4 party play suck people just rip through map in this game like literally a whole map like 40 screen width in about 2 minute then rush through the next one the game be balance around this and you have to go that fast to see profit there be not a way to go slow in a dangerous map and see the same return it be all about easy map as fast as possible you will feel like people pull you through the whole game this game have to be tune down so that the pace be more reasonable then they could retune the drop to also be more reasonable another problem with party play be the sheer number of sparkly thing and circle and ring and projectile it be be impossible to see what be go on generally everything be dead the second you see it but if it be not you would not be able to tell if you love this game i could understand why but do not pretend you love these part of it these be fixable problem if there be the community will to have them fix if you do not think over a thousand hour be a long time to play a game i think you have an addiction i be an avid gamer but there have to be bounderie on what be reasonable to expect your player to do in order to progress hope they fix it,neg

4493,the thing that ruin this be respawn wait time if we die we should be able to respawn emmediatly without have to wait 10 20 minute just so we can play again it especially suck for new player who die very often becuase if your try to learn the control and every time you play so you can get well you die after around a minute just to end up back on the title screen wait for another 10 minute no one like wait to respawn and it make every game terrible 30 second wait time fine but 10 minute be just mess up it be like hand someone fake money and tell them to go buy something with it you just do not do it,neg
4494,i just like it you can play as completly f2p or go p2p these two be both fun and can be entertain you miss out on certain hero and worker but you only need them if you maximise your output they be also well than normal worker which probaply take you 2 year they be also a little bit faster and if you play that long money spend on this game probaply do not hurt support be also pretty nice to me at least its fun but to an extend p2w its also nice that you can play on your phone and pc and browser facebook seemless,pos

4497,early access reviewi be still very much on the fence about this game however since it be very much alpha i will give it a positive review for now there be a lot of gripe to be have about this game but when you boil it down it be an easy go all right rpg however the gripe will hopefully be put to rest when more update come out 1 die kill 1 die kill another dying this be a major gripe of mine aoe spell do nothing but aggro enemy and make you die faster you may say well just level up and get well equipment the problem be that the dungeon already set you to a particular level and your spell needless to say suck and it become a button masher 2 attack range now this be a pain in theto say the least you can attack at melee range but unless you be really close to the enemy the enemy will auto heal and you will lose your chance to continue to use spell annoy 3 grindfest now i do not really mind it in this game but you may the entire game be a grindfest and combine that with gripe 1 it become tedious and clumbersome yeah i do not know why i give it a positive recommendation,pos

4499,early access reviewthe game start off with a few flaw like every early access game i try my good to look over the obvious mistake such as presette unchangable combo where they put a ranged taunt right after a melee attack or a skill that have bonus effect on 0 bravery stack right after a skill that add 1 bravery stack and many more but with every single patch lately the game developer just make clear that they have never experience their own game and refuse to put deep thought into it late example a skill cooldown get increase from 7s to 30 while the possible cooldown spec remain on the same flat amount of max 0 8s also the damage and balance adjustment be randomly guess by the team behind it and even though they really react fast to the community it feel like they should much rather take their time or fire most of their responsible people besides these horrible and hilarious adjustment the game show many game change bug such as randomly make your dodge ability unusable even though it be up and ready or make you lose rune from your gear which be not suppose to be lose while pvpe on the exclusive pvp battleground just because a randomly implement pve mob kill you there this game be a great example of how to add insult to injury with every single patch and i could just make the list of horrible bug and skilltree longer and longer as i just give a few very recent example above but let end this review with a solid rating of 1 10why not 0 because the game still have potential and eventually be save some day,neg

4528,i have give this thing a thorough attempt ignore the other review and opinion on this game what i can say be that it be pretty much an outdated garbage heap with nothing to offer a player gameplay ie combat be complete trash messy uncomfortable and make it feel like a bad basterdization of tab target with a poor attempt at action combat horribly throw in the mix have play some game with hybrid play as well as pure tab targeting and action combat i can not recommend this game combat system to anyone graphic be on par with archage which be to say very outdated and limited seem though that some of the visual optimization issue some people be have have be clean up so it do at least for me run very smoothly though still visually outdated on top of this their interface though pretty standard have its own little setback and the setting of it all along with the subpar skill system make it less than desirable the thing that annoy me the most be that this game have an upcoming revamp version for xbox that use the new unreal engine 4 to run on i feel like in do so they have pretty much slap anyone who support them in the face with this move not be hype or have high expectation when attempt to try this game i be neither surprised nor disappoint i hope that anyone who read this will decide for themselves what a heaping pile of trash not only this game be but the dev who design it and continue to fail the player globally,neg

4530,early access reviewi think eternal should exist because people have different taste in life have say that i do not really support the old scheme of resource draw a k a land or sigil in this game the concept of mana flood screw be a problem that should not exist the way eternal manage mulligan be clever but not enough even if you vomit your resource theory it do not matter how pro you be if luck just screw you on the other side i have to say that eternal have the good free to play scheme however like any other ccg whilst expansion start to hoard new player will have an increasingly difficult time to build a collection no matter how generous the game it be in the beginning if it do not scale with the increase card pool at some point you start draft the same card over and over so you end with little to none value even if they give it to you so as a final veredict i stop play eternal mainly because mana flood screw it become expensive in time to farm resource the return value be pathetic and balance can be tricky sometimes however i do not think it be bad at all if you be mtg fanboy you should give it a try otherwise run from here and try something else to avoid waste your time,neg
4531,this game be one of the best free to play i have ever play its the kind of game that you can play for hour and still not learn everything there be i have play 26 hour at the time of this review and still have not use the autopilot weapon system and much more everytime i play this i seem to learn something i do not know before it do take a while to get a hang of and i would not recommend it to anybody who give up easily because you do need to crash a lot in order to get a hang of everything it be a game that seem to reward those who put in the time to learn how to fly specific plane because it have a ton of keyboard binding some a necessity some a conveniance the plane you get in the free version do a good job at show two side of pilot the tf 51d be a plane that in the game require some learning in order to know how to just start it since it have an eight step proccess to start the engine once you get the tf 51d in the air it seem to be an easy plane to learn because it do not have a very high top speed and therefore have less you can mess up with in thing such as land the su 25 t be completely different because it make everything on the ground easy but once you be in the air you can break your wing off if you turn too sharp which i know from experience the community from what i have experience be very friendly and i do not hesitate to ask them question because they be helpful for the most part aside from the lctrl e e e joke every once in a while overall this game be great it be a game i would willingly buy which make it even better that it be free if you would like a game that can teach you something while you learn this would be a great game to try,pos

4535,early access revieweternal be what happen if you mix hearthstone and magic the gathering it be more complex than hearthstone due to the fact that you can block attack unit with your own much like in magic the gathering also you do not just get mana every turn automatically but by playing may card which be kind of similar to land card in magic the gathering so beware becaus you may get landscrewed but do not let that discourage you to try this awesome free ccg due to its mechanic it be a hell of a lot deep than hearthstone while visually every bit as attractive there be a whole lot of singleplayer content in it which provide you with gold and card you can earn every card in the game without ever play against somebody online that be a huge plus in my opinion there be a single player mode call challenge in which you fight one ai opponent after another to unlock reward the more opponent you defeat without lose the great your reward and it be absolutely free and can repeatet as often as you like another singleplayer mode be gauntlet in which you draft your deck to play against ai opponent much like in the challenge mode the difference here be that you can actually keep your draft deck afterwards even if you lose against the first ai that to me be absolutely fantastic and something that always put me off in hearthstone arena mode where you have to choose between buy a pack or risk your hard earn gold in hope for more than just one pack that beee say it cost gold to enter gauntlet mode which be gather failry quick if you like d hearthstone or magic the gathering or any other digital ccg i strongly recommend try this one it have a huge collection of card and have the fair free to play model i have ever see in a digital ccg great job dev keep it up,pos

4564,  update reviewfebruary 25 2015 well i decide to spend a little more time on raceroom racing experience and admittedly it be a lot well than when i try it last year i have be able to complete single player ai race on two track and i can practice on three track the selection of car be a little well for be free but still not enough to really keep you entertain i do not try the online portion of this partially because i be pretty bad at this game i be more use to forza and gt and partially because most people play online be use dlc that you need to purchase this game definitely have great physics and i will probably give it another shot use my g27 instead of my xbox 360 controller unfortunately i still can not recommend it you can pay for a full game like pcars or assetto corsa and receive a lot more content than raceroom can deliver in its dlc pack from what i be read old reviewmay 26 2014 during the small amount of time i have have play this i honestly do not think this be a free to play game admittedly this game feel and play more like a demo than f2p only be able to play hot lap mode with one track a few variant of that one track but still one location and very few car make this game feel like a joke when advertise as free to play while the gameplay be decent enough i feel that the control of the car could be a little well use a g27 i feel as if i can not seem to turn sharp enough to get through some corner unless i slow down to rediculously slow speed and that be only use 200 degree of the wheel as a comparison on assetto corsa i can pull decent turn during the curve and that be use the full 900 degree of the wheel unfortunately i can not recommend this for your simulation fix i think you would be well off currently purchase assetto corsa,neg
4565,early access reviewso while i could not get the full enjoyment out of the game for my multiplayer experience i will start off by say this be a wonderfully design game by appearance the interface to create and learn recipe be great for single player experience loot and interact with the world be quite nice even the idea of server host world right out of the box be awesome but that lead to my major gripe and what ultimately lead to me cease to play the game with my friend random world reset usually via one player crash be the big annoyance i have after play for about a half an hour we would have establish a nice place storage and what not then at least one of us crash those that do come back to the world to see everything we build and remove from the world restore to how it be when we first find it they could fly through wall and the floor as if there be no clipping on them only because in their game the entire structure do not exist anymore if they be to extract the block in their way which be part of the structure in our version they would receive the material as they see it but we would see that craft item be pick up and effectively delete due to them get dirt instead to alleviate this those that could see pack up the base and move to a new location till the issue repeat you can only be willing to rebuild redesign a structure so many time before you just give up ultimately i assume this issue come from world datum be save on the user pc and not coincide refresh base on the severs datum at least a debug tool which force a refresh of currently load cell chunk to be download from the server would be useful until this issue be fix but until that time i will await for update and play other game once again the game be amazing at what it have so far but that issue be killer for anyone hope for a solid multiplayer experience,pos

4567,early access reviewpretty unique solid game mechanic i agree with other reviewer comment on this its like a spaceship moba i particuarly enjoy the art direction on the ship as well as the lumber manueverability during gameplay it really give you a sense of the massiveness of the boat lastly i hope they keep skin as the only thing that cost money to avoid ptw also particularly interesting be how the class be essentially divide base on ship size manueverability and specific cd what set this apart be the 3 dimensional aspect of each engagement give that its still in alpha i will give them the benefit of the doubt on the following 1 optimization2 lag spike in game3 connectivity issue into matches4 no complete texture on most stationary object what i would like to see more of personally be as follow 1 large team 5v5 seem too small 10v10 sound awesome with big map 2 a slighter further zoom on the ship3 well effect on cqc type weapons4 more game modes5 more non interactive background battle in some of these map for immersion 6 more customization on loadout think mechwarrior online 7 a grand conflict to engage community to work towards something other than just a grind 8 it be awesome if eve be like this will buy again for sure,pos
4568,it be all about how you see iti have play this game for a long time since it start and tell you that it be pretty fun until you reach lvl 60 thing change and you have the urge to pay real money for real equipment but the storyline of the game be amazing the boss be also good and the dungeon be fantastic not to forget you can make your own map that you can post it and have other donate for your work with asteral diamond which be a currency you can either buy or get overall8 10 give it a try and you judge d it be free for a while xd,pos
4569,special funny lucky friendly exciting heart pump smart cheeky and memorable moment with amazing people in a game with so much distinctive character in it put a smile on your and make it incomparable than the rest because of its special thing from its tiny map prop to the class to the comic_strip and even to the update not dead legend do not die,pos
4570,i have always love this game i love the idea of own my own home be it an inn or prestige and be able to decorate it lot of endless possibility i love do the quest craft raid the most unique part of this mmo compare to other the guide they be there to chat listen to your concern and they take time out of their day to also run quest a game i will continue to play,pos
4571,this game be pretty good it be basically all those popular voxel game put together to make a good game overview so when you first launch up the game you make your account which be pretty easy so i do not mind that and then you make your character the character creation be nice with a couple hair style and lot of color to choose for anything really so after create your character you get put into your own world this be basically the tutorial section of the game this little cube name qb be basically your navi h e y l i s t e n they will help you along in all your adventure after you get through the tutorial section of the game you can start do stuff by your own there be not really an end to the game unless you count the end as collect all item which be yeah you know the gameplay be really fun too the combat feel balanced and the building be pretty polished for the time it be be out this game be really fun especially if you have friend who play too you can make world together and stuff tl dr creativerse be a voxel game which be very polished and really fun,pos
4572,i will keep update my review since i be discover something new i like every day i have never feel so excited play a simulator or a videogame thank to facetrack noir i can move my head in the game just by use a webcam and explore every aspect of the su 25 cockpit the level of detail be absurd the difficulty be as hard as expect but so damn rewarding i manage to complete the take off landing and i be almost do with the artillery tutorial and it really feel like something,pos
4573,for some reason first level you be match with low level player and there be no vehicle it be pure soldier fight then you reach level 5 or something like that and suddently there be vehicle everywhere you be match with very high player and the game suddendly become really uninteresting and annoying i remember my first game with vehicle no one have weapon to kill say vehicle in my team for simple reason that we be all too low level to have unlock the weapon require to fight against vehicle so we spend the game try to avoid the unkillable armored vehicle of enemy team do not even need to mention that we lose because their armored vehicle be camp our spawn the second game i join i spawn start to run for 10 sec and suddently a plane dive on me and kill me spawn again another plane dive on me and kill me plane camp our spawn the third game there be no third game with vehicle i uninstalle i have fun til i reach the require level to have vehicle in my game which mean approximatively 10 15 game without vehicle then it be just a spawn camp bore fest the decent item weapon you have to pay for them this game be exactly what you can expect from greedy developer i hate to say it but i try battlefield 1 even if i promise myself to never ever play this franchise because the last good bf game be bf2 and all game after it be just money grab pile of poop well you want a good war game battlefield 1 be way well than previous bf game and honestly the balance between weapon and vehicle be really good i never feel overwhelmed by vehicle yes they be annoying but not unstoppable if you want to invest few buck get bf1 and have some fun worth your money avoid hero and general at all cost you will just waste your money into it the only thing that be interesting in h g be the general part of the game which be not open to new player the good player be general and they can take decision on europe map to decide where they be send their soldier goal of each side be to conquer all europe and then ordinary soldier will fight for objective decide by their general every win be a territory capture on the map it be really interesting idea honestly a part of the game be a kind of rts and the other be fps but yeah again the greedy dev be make this game absolutely awful and unbalanced to play sadly too bad for them go get bf1,neg
4574,early access reviewi be not a huge fan of the battle royale genre however i can safely say this be the exception for me i start play the weekend close alpha start and i can see how much this game have grow since then as it be now it be honestly a fun game to play i be sure once it reach beta or when it be fully release it will be so much well,pos
4575,very good game a big learing curve but after you get the basic down it be so much fun you also have the option to play so many diffrent god so the game allways fell new to me even though i have 108 hour the last part be the toxic pepole who play this game you run into them every like 4 5 game but you can just mute them,pos
4576,pro you can be tanker to blow infantry with tank you can be infantry to blow tank with anti tank mine and airplane with anti air gun you can be pilot to blow theout with plane you can be parathroper to capture enemy camp you can be sniper to blow infantry head if you be accurate enough to aim camo or skin in this game really help you to blend with the environtment you need play this game with headset it will help you to hear enemy footstep and you can set ambush for them the dev add update for grind system and make more easy for newbie to get credit con repetitive gameplay all you do be just capture enemy camp with time limit many people say this game pay to win but for me be pay to progress this game all about grind so i do not recommend people to play it if not patient enough to grind credit for buy weapon tank vehicle at least every month you need buy veteran membership to help earn credit and earn exp rank faster like monthly subcription but you can play without it too but it will take you long enough to earn credit and reach the high rank,pos
4577,early access reviewthis game be suprisingly good the main advantage of this game compare to fortnite be there be no f king build its all about your shooting skill it be sooo satisfying when you can just shoot someone without expect them to build a damn tower in 0 0001 second skill and class give more depth to this game make it good enough to leave behind fortnite or pubg if you be unsatisfied with them for any reason i 100 recommend this game,pos
4578,the idea be great the game be ok sadly it be full of hacker tweaker mouse macros etc just google youtube for h g macro and since it be basically a free game lot of kid do not mind use those hack their nickname be well known to the community but they do not seem to ever get ban maybe because there be no work anticheat and the ingame report function do not seem to do anything can not recommend you be really waste your time and possibly your money here better look for something else,neg
4579,i love this game i have already spend countless hour on it and still have not get tired of it it be f2p with an option to buy special item in game but unlike most f2p game it be not pay to win update be always regular since they happen every 2 week if you play this game the good thing i can recommend be to make lot of friend while it be fun play alone the experience you get from play with friend be much well give it it try it be free so what do you have to lose,pos
4580,early access reviewthis game be amazing to say it be only in alpha definite must buy for anyone who like game like sto star conflict or elite dangerous also it be a great price at only a7,pos
4581,  note i have play about 14000 game of blitz and 5000 game of pc wot so my steam hour be by far not everything this game be just like real life it require a lot of skill but be mostly base on luck the grinding possibility be almost endless also you will never have to go to the shop to buy salt again bring to you by wargayme to be serious though it be a fun game but there be a lot of annoying aspect to it would get 6 10 from me,pos
4582,early access reviewfrom hero to zero when the game come out it be really good but as now after all the bad patch they fu ed up whole game its really sad but we can not do anything about it i have fun but everything have to end one day,neg
4583,early access reviewgame be very hard to get a group in let alone grind to max would be unbearable as its just a quest grind or single mob elite mob farm unless you want to treat it like a job also pvp be very small ever since the release of siege i do not think they ever even once have one map with the maximum amount of player for the 50 v 50 because the game population fall so rapidly due to inbalenced combat and they only have two server so let that s speak to for its active player most the veteran still play be likely people who benifitte from these early bug and nerf also guild be kinda pointless do not really care about you if their 5 man group have fill limit on dungeon per day make this a clique game if i ever see one oh and pvp be restrict to certain time of day so you may as well find another game to play honestly unless you would like to base your life by this game schedule and even more sadly their pay people to play their game openly luuul,neg
4584,  give it a try this game be kinda fun at a basic level and if you like minecraft mmorpg game then this game be worth a try i will not say much about this game as i honestly do not like it that much but that be say i can not say it be a bad game just because i do not like it it be a pretty good game and you should give it a try it be just not my cup of tea,pos
4585,very good diablo clone have an amazing hack and slash feel to it skill system gem and passive be both very good currency system be a little odd but overall i think its a good thing have a gritty dark theme to it,pos
4586,buggy driving physic not in matter that game get bug it be medium tank be drive like a buggy car slide careen and do police turn thtas not only on concrete surface where it could be understandable but even on soft ground and under water sudden death syndrome a 12 mm machine gun can kill tiger by random hit that kill entire crew not really fun for anyone who be not into camping tacticslarge bias in performance of armor toward russian tank strange that soft german target flak new tds as well as russian aa gun that mean to have paper armor can surwive literally dozen penetrate hit and bounce some preium content do not worth it premium account do nothing but add silver income which can be obtain in large amount without that premium tank be not worth 45 cost aexcept couple of russians convert convertable research point highly contraproductive,neg
4587,i like it but it be a bit slow while wait for everything to happen the main way to speed thing up be to buy from the shop with real money well that make sense right so i never spend any money and i grow tired of it and uninstalle it just do not grab me enough to spend any money on it it be good just not for me how can you rate a free thumb down,pos
4588,early access reviewfantastic game feel a lot different to any other batte royale i have play with the class system forging be a nice unique feature that add to the fun and tension of the game as they basically act as hotspot on the map definitely worth give a shot,pos
4589,i love this game even i do not play any fallout before since i play this game in mobile i love all about fallout but my pc not enought strong to play that lol sad and fallout shelter playable in pc i play it when i be rest of my another game dota i always wish to have game fallout4 for free maybe i will upgrade my pc in last year hahai hope this game can link in mobile in steam background,pos

4591,this be a great game even the comment be fun to read especially linkno1s personally and this be probably just me i think everyone should learn about gun that way they would not be such p ssie when it come to own and handle one this game be a great first step in learn about gun practice of coarse be a whole different story my wife and i both enjoy this game because it be like a puzzle game combine with the game of memory combine with thing that can kill and maim what be not to like and for the record my wife do not want gun in the house until i take her to the shooting range now she think she be rambo it be quite sexy now if i can just get her to wear a bikini when we go the only down side be that when we argue she swear she be go to go tarantino on myquot i usually have to remind her that he often use mexican stand off in his film which mean that she would not make it out alive either her response be i do not care i do not bring you in this world but i will take you out she be so cute anyway if you want a chance at survival in dangerous situation this game be a good starting point in learn about the tool you will need minus the tank and rocket launcher unless that be your thing i be not one to judge if you want to be a scared victim learn how to use the phone to call the cop and die wait for them although i do not think there be a game for that mainly because gun be cool and everyone love shoot thing and blow thing up but i digress if there be a game like that it be probably british author note before anyone get upset at me for my last comment i just want to point out that shoot a home invader in the face with a gun be a whole lot quicker than beat him her about the head and shoulder with a cricket bat although ye ole willow wood have less move part also keep in mind that criminal do not care about gun law come to think of it they may not care about cricket rule either i do not know maybe try this game bundle with don bradman cricket 14 or counter strike global offensive bundle with cricket revolution regardless i recommend this game,pos
4592,tl dr if you enjoy give up your whole life to play a video game that be unbalanced as all heck then sure play it prepare to whip out your wallet and just give it to them otherwise well i put in enough time on this game to grace it with a review first i would like to point out that despite it come out a couple year after world of tank plane ship it still seem to mess up the one thing that mobas yes it be a moba last time i check u could not fly drive from russian to paris or w e tend to be good at and that be team balance in term of game play i mean you either know what to do or you do not simple as that no team cover for you when you want to assault a point no team provide fire support for you when you defend it be basically a bunch of people run around shoot at thing people i say thing because there be pve although i would wager that some of the ai in this game be cheat they know exactly where you be at all time know exactly where to shoot at all time never miss due to rng and will always score kill on you when they hit it be a shame that such thought go into the rpg aspect of this game at least more so than world of x as you can already tell i have play both gaigin and wg game i like tank like ship more although steel ocean be well at it than these two cash grab company all that aside do not kid yourself this game be just a big long con cash grab the company i would imagine see just how great and excited aka dumb and gullible us gamer be to see that we can progress the rank and fight with well tank if we just spend a little a metric ton to be more clear gold in the game gold eagles be the cash only currency do not get me wrong i know there be not any such thing as free to progress free to play meh ok but most people get bored of play a couple hour a day just to see you progress down your rank tier couple 100 xp per battle for a win and you will lose often when you need something like 50k xp to unlock a semi decent vehicle it be sad that they show picture of naval combat on their store page when they have not even come close to be do with it just a another sad marketing ploy by a sad and full of crap company,neg
4593,drive well feel good have lot of fun with the hill climb many little detail that i could appreciate much love however dodge a bunch of handicapped people who manage to flip their car every qualifying session t1 make you swerve and get your lap invalidate get very tiring after not even a day i start off with a pad then upgrade and it feel great with a wheel but there be so many bad driver around i have uninstalle the whole thing which bring me to another point 35 gb for only a few car and track you can actually use in race you will just get ram off and you can just sit through 25 minute of practice and qualify again afterwards no matter where you start you will get hit good game bad player and bad measure against them i have encounter some very sportsmanlike people as well both in victory and defeat in term of yield or just cleanly pass you with superior pace i suppose the f2p model cut both way you can give it a try but it attract not so serious player that will ruin your experience get the other car and track to escape the f2p camp be probably more pricey in the end than get a full game so this be a no for me in the end,neg
4594,early access reviewthis be ahum be actually a brilljant game love it when it come out some patch later they screw it all up and make some kind offps out of it build stuff be stil fun but you can just respawn if you get bust keep classic mode on the side be not work imho,neg

4596,early access reviewfracture space be in early access and the game be already great i can not wait for what will come in the future of its development the game consist of space battle and the ship you use be not those agile space fighter you see in other game and in movie they be large slow and can not turn on a dime and honestly that be refreshing to see and awesome to play as it make you have to commit to you action because you can not just bail from a fight if it turn sour you have the ability to warp back to base however this take time to boot up and drasticly reduce your defense so unless you start the jump before they turn their attention to you you be most likely dead also some ship can jump short distance but that do not mean that they escape your weapon range and some ship can disable ability the game also have moba esq quality you have to capture the enemy base to win you have to push up side lane in order to access say base after a set amount of time a zone open up that if capture provide a buff to the team that capture it ship be classify as dps tank and support you could call the game a moba but it do not feel like a moba so if you have a thign against mobas do not write this game off i highly reccommend this game,pos

4601,early access reviewso where to begin this game be good and have some good concept and design the graphic be very visually pleasing and the game run smooth minus some rendering issue now and then there be a good baseline of item that can be use however apart from the block all the item can be aquire fairly quickly i have play this game for about 15 hour in total and pretty much have every item minus all block colour and combination which really be not long time get to end game item as this game will be closely compare to minecraft for obvious reason although the content be lack in creativerse in time they would be able to compete with them such as a redstone equivalent the big problem with this game be the fact that block can take forever to create use forging rather than craft as this game have some very visually pleasure content for structure this should be address so people can come into the game and just create something like a creative mode would suit this game very well overall the way the game stand i would give this game a 6 5 10 and would recommend it to someone who would like a change from minecraft,pos

4607,early access reviewtldr one of the good card game out there not recommend due to flawed apparently unfixable core mana power mechanic comparison to mtg and hearthstone barely do it justice while it draw inspiration from the two the varied mechanic make every faction color fight on equal footing from aggro to midrange or even late game mammoth deck they all clash for a piece of the pie well the same be valid for every card game what make this one special the sheer feel of power your card give compare to any other ccg the strength of these card be absurd the feed back you get from your deck when you win be that you stomp the opponent even if the game be close while lose have the reverse effect the game do not let you dwell on the past reward be give with every occasion single player campaign ai game first win of the day and so on you will have to keep your aspiration to a top tier place in check tough get a decent collection still require investment time and or money as in every ccg other player have say more positive about the game than i could write in a limited space as such i will focus on why i give it a negative mark like mtg it suffer from power fixing issue you either get too much or too little mana power flood or screw they mend the algorithm several time and yet it be far from work i will not quote other player or streamer suffice to say the issue be real the amount of game lose due to mana power issue be enough to make the grind tiring and unpleasant as strange as it sound its even sad when the opponent have it add these loss up you end up with a simple question why be not there anything be do well there be maybe the communication regard the issue be minimal for me the big question be why they choose the classical mtg style of mana power fixing know the flaw it have more so consider some of the main developer be former mtg player the game be beautiful fun mechanic captivating game great feed back and reward but all of it be diminish to a zero line by its flawed core mechanic mana power fix a flaw i do not believe will ever be fix prove me wrong,neg
4608,elsword feature skill base action gameplay combine with role play element and community feature typical of an mmorpg such as guild chat and item trade i be very addicted to the game i personally love it i always like these type of game since it have that manga anime feel to it their be about 6 character at the moment 8 29 15 and i have a lot of stuff to talk about this game so let us get start the story seem to be lead a good way of what be happen there be always a good amount of sub quest story quest to enjoy the one thing i love be that different character have a unique skill style class path ect the voice acting be pretty nice i do not mind too much from it since it be voice in japanese the stage environment be a 8 7 10 since it be not really perfect in my opinion but it be nice there be some main story quest that have a cinematic cutscene after you complete it very nice to the story overall different gameplay mechanic item equipment feature and other great thing that make this game alive but then there be one problem to elsword the pvp matchup seem to be alright but bad at the same time because due to have to vs lvl 70 that will 1 shot you but most of my time on pvp it be do not occur too much then it use to i know people be say this be a pay2win type of game it be be one of those typical game but keep it clean and have fun with your friend if your friend play it overall i must rate this game a total of 9 10 remember everyone will have their own opinion have a wonderful day elsword main page wiki page,pos

4610,early access reviewthe fps in this game be so awful that i can not go into any town area as that make it so bad that it be as good as have your game freeze additionally when the game developer decide every class be do too much damage they nerfe each class by 80 and no that be not an exaggeration naturally this make it near impossible to finish any story quest with more than one enemy not to mention any dungeon i may be able to put up with that but the fps be the bad which they will not even aknowledge despite hundred of player scream about it on twitter etc do not buy this game until after they have fix such issue after that it may be worth it,neg
4611,if you care about story and the choice you make i would not suggest this game while the story be neat and they be sell more it come at an odd price that feel like no one think it through when you make choice in the story each one of the two give you a specific card and as it be a card game where the idea be to make a deck you enjoy i find it odd that the card i want always go against the choice i want to make i could ge the well card to work with my deck or choose the story option i want but never both the game itself be neat but the story be what i be follow and i be unable to keep go with this issue,neg

4613,early access reviewat the time of this review i would like to let other know that the game be very unrefined for that reason alone i do not recommend it for purchase give this particular game past failure one would expect additional effort from the developer into make sure this release would be a successful one sadly that have not be the case as many of the current issue should have never get past quality control one must wonder why the developer release the game in its current state know full well how the western audience would receive it i be struggle to keep myself from jump on the cash grab hate bandwagon i can not seem to find many justifiable reason for the action the neowiz team have take i honestly want this game to succeed but the developer be not do themselves any favor,neg
4614,as a simracing beginner i have to say that i like this title the feeling of the car be very good and the sound be just awesome i can not describe how good and realistic it be the apex hunt feature have help me as a beginner to reduce my lap time and learn the track and break point ok there be some negative point aswell such as miss night day feature weather and multiplayer another negative point be that if you want all of the content such as track car and livery you better start save up some money because it be very expensive the overall image be good i think but not perfect it be a develop product so it be improve with every update and the fact that it be more or less free to play you can drive 2 car on one track and participate in challenge should encourage everyone to at least try it out i would highly suggest it for those who be simrace beginner or for those who want to see if they like simracing or not,pos
4615,fallout shelter great fun game nice time waster really enjoyable never really play these type of game but shelter do good what it do you be the overseer that control everything in the vault really fun train all your dweller for special stat equip all that gear send them out into the wasteland or on quest which be fun to do but can take a while if you do not have or be low on quantum some quest reward them so if you have no problem wait you will get some more some also reward lunchboxe no need to buy them but if you want more fast loot buy away same with craft it take time can speed it up a little by equip dweller with certain gear for stat on whatever you be craft or can be complete straight away with quantum it be good save them up get more dweller be good the old fashioned way the radio studio be pretty bad in my case rarely have i get dweller from the outside and also apperantely attract deathclaw or enemy in general more often to attack not sure combat be a little too fast pace at least in a big vault with a lot of dweller quest be fine if they start lose health too fast which happen pretty often you get to heal them all fast one by one and sometimes a few can die with the clunky clicking around especially when one attack happen soon after another and you have not recover the common attack especially deathclaw and accident can get pretty annoying but it be managable good to expand slowly i like the way cappy and bottle visit pretty often play track from nuka world and raise that happines cool also pet pet be cute seem like legendary dweller be really rare also none from fallout new vegas which be a shame it be no big deal really but include some would be fun and great mysterious stranger the badass appear pretty often who give cap random amount sometimes can be a pain to find on time but still fun maybe an elder scroll game like fallout shelter would be fun who know overall very fun game definitely recommend,pos

4624,early access reviewthe gameplay be fun the weapon feel good however that be the end of the good the progression now be completely luck base mean one person who put 50 hour in could possibly have well gear than someone who put 500 hour in that my friend be bull on top of that the dev have be scummy a friend of mine be silence can not use chat because they complain about the luck base progression they get offend and decide to silence say friend for profanity reason i do not reccomend this game especially after all of the progression change as update go by and the sensitive dev who can not take criticism do not bother with the game there be a lot well game out there to play than this one,neg
4625,dota 2 be a 5 v 5 moba game you have a selection out of 108 unique hero each with a unique skillset every hero be also available from the minute you start no playing x amount of game before this hero become available the object of dota 2 be to destroy the other team ancient to do this you can work your way down any of the 3 lane top mid or bottom by destroy the outer tower you will start most match pair up or go into a lane solo try to get some experience and gold by last hit creeps as the game progress you will start team up more with your other team member to take on the other team or to quickly kill of a solo member of their team because of the importance of coordinate your attack with other team member communication be a very important aspect of the game i therefor also recommend play this game with some friend because random people that you will be team up with will not always show the same willingness to communicate if you be just start out play dota 2 i also recommend play with a friend who already have some experience in the game because the learning curve be very steep especially when you have to figure everything out by yourself the skill ceiling be also extremely high so every time you play you may learn something new due to the high number of available hero skill and item you can be sure that every game be unique something to be wary of be the community there be people out there that take this game way more seriously than you may most player have an opinion of what you should have do in a certain situation and will be happy to blame a lost teamfight on you not take that action flaming be something that could happen often but if you be play with a team entirely make up of your friend this should not prove to be an issue if this be not the case do not worry you can always mute the player that be cause you grief and continue enjoy this wonderful team orient game,pos

4628,such a great moba even if you do not like traditional mobas you should try smite if you like game like world of warcraft then you really should like smite because the 3rd person view make it a quite similar experience hi rez interact a lot with the community which be awesome and in smite you can get all current and future god character for only 25 which if you for example look at league of legends 25 be an amazing even impossible deal i highly recommend this game and do not let my hour confuse you i have play 700h before the steam version come out,pos

4644,i be a wwii nerd so obvs i like this game esp the wwii era of the tank you can some what learn some history if you do your research etc etc on the tank the way it be make the reason why it be make etc anyway personally blitz be much well vs world of tank the normal one or whatever tf you wanna call it blitz be a much fast pace with less player on each side and a much small map along with that there s no artys aka artillery which be bless bc artillery be annoying play this game over the year on both the pc and mobile version not too big of a difference of movement i guess that s the term idk anyway cross platform of both pc and mobile version no big difference whatever your well at control either hold a tablet or ipad or just keyboard personally keyboard a bit annoying simply bc sometimes harder to move left hand away from wasd while try to shoot the enemy tank while try to dodge so you kinda panic ish but whatever just depend your play style no big issue with the game lot of update frequently not very bad from time to time there be event or speical mission pretty cool tbh currently most annoying thing have to be afk ppl some i will say be afk other be not an afk issue simply bc sometimes not often but maybe every so month you start a game you load and do not load in until maybe 30 to 40 second after the game have start pretty annoying second most annoying thing be when ppl say oh your a pay to win buddy stfu honestly you literally have a tank that cost money too even than what s bad be they run into open die within the 1 min of when the game start than blame on the team say y all camp personally i think once you start out play this game be kinda meh or boring etc feel grindy bc you need to get certain amount of xp to research something new than go to next tier etc etc tier 8 in my opinon have the most action all type of skill level you have player that be new if they buy a tier 8 premuim tank not really pay to win bc each and every tank have a advantage disadvantage against any other tank along with that it depend on how you play and how your team be for example some player with heavy tank powerful gun strong armor but slow speed some player will literally sit in the back of the map not say you can not but you really can not win the round if your go to sit in the back and let your light tank medium tank or tank destroyer die now not all be like that some be very skilled they be able to read on what they should do should not do against another tank other sigh they yolo it as in push 4 tank and die right in the open while shoot once and probably never hit anyone or pen against them obvsly you start off with low tier tank when you start the game but there s a reason to teach you oh how the game will be etc you have many nation that you can pick usa ussr french german china japan or british tank each one of those have there own special perk or skill for example german tank very heavy armor with strong armor same with the soviet tank the french however be less armored but they have a mag shell or autoloader as in they reload maybe 17 20 second depend what tank but they have the ability to move fast pace and shoot total of 3 shell in less than 5 second as in let say the amx 50 100 you have 4 shell total in a mag it take 17 idk something around that second but you can shoot 4 shell you shoot once than it take 3 3 second to reload the next one and so on until you shoot all 4 than it reload again with the full 17 second very overpower in its own way if you have the timing but can be annoy bad in time as in close combat or 1 v 2 just depend now the british tank very good but they have one of the most if not most of all the tank fire less than 7 to 9 second which as you get to high tier it get annoying and you would want to take the british tank out first simply bc their go to keep nail you before you can even reload the next shot however some tank like the americans and japanese tank you will not really see much of japense tank simply bc they kinda suck however for american tank you will not really see any tier 6 or 7 tank i hardly ever see any simply bc every tank for any of the nation beat it cough cough fix t20 bc its useless but lead to the m48 patton which be very good not only that look good too other than those tank you will see a few tank which do not look wwii era or stupid tank however its nice to see different tank instead of go against the same old tank overall for customization do not look bad very different from the other world of tank less thing to add but here the camo do not look as bad they help you in the game along with that i really look forward when they can create attachment for each tank like is3 is6 all the attachment look sick the american eagle look great on some of the american tank but position very odd kinda suck that all tier 10 tank have their own legendary skin and attachment if wargaming can make it so the customization be same for both platform on blitz and the normal orginal one it would be bless something to note about this game there be rank however not many ppl play it or atleast it take awhile for me to get into a rank game there s 2 modes team deathmatch and supremacy mode capture the flag there s 3 or 4 depend on the map first to 1k point or to knock out the other tank win graphic be not too bad look the same from my eye on pc to mobile sadly on pc version you only get to 60 fps max bit annoying at time when fps drop but whatever another thing you will not be place in a match in different region never have that happen never really have bad ping unless you play mobile without wifi aka not at home or idfk aslong as you play with wifi do you have good connection replay be nice you can sometimes learn from mistake on what you do etc etc by rewatche the match that you play ps it be not a pay to win game i have not pay a single dollar to get from a tank to another tank in a tech tree i only pay for the tank that i really want aka let say the scorpion be a new tank that come out a couple of day i have a dollar xd be so stupid litterally just click and bam get it with 1 ppl get salty bc you get it and they could not but whatever anyway as i be say only time you would pay be for get more garage slot if you really want to keep every tank that you have get ps you would not really keep every tank there s no point just some tank you play you will hate and once you get enough xp for the other you instantly sell it xd it just take time to get enough xp for the next tank not only that you need enough credit to buy it and have enough to resupply ammo camo gear etc many factor go in it also why people buy premium tank be bc it give good credit so that way you can grind faster but you do not have to buy it you have a 1 chance from a crate idk off top of my head but free crate every so day week so you have a chance,pos
4645,it take 20 minute to load multiplayer and there s a 75 chance it will crash i have not play before 2 5 but i hear it be preformance be much well than now i have an i5 760 but it should still be able to load the game fix the preformance then it be a 7 10 the flight realisim and immersion be just what i want when get a pc move from a xbox 360 as a kid the community like 104th mavrick and many niche other youtuber streamer be great but the module be too overpriced and the game can not be play without them i would personaly rather buy the game at a 30 40 dollar price tag and progressivly unlock the plane somehow maybe that s just me,neg

4650,honestly a really fun grinder game with lot of different tactic and style you can set up so many kind of build the game itself progress relatively quickly compare to some clicker game not to mention while this be free it do not force its pay element down your throat rather its something i personally buy a bit of to support the team behind the game give it a shot,pos

4655,early access reviewfor a free to play fps it be not terrible and it do hold up to its promise of not be p2w pay to win yes there be some thing in the game that be clunky like the shotgun be super powerful sniper rifle be use on very small map make them one shot kill if you be quick to react and sometimes it feel even though you be aim at a guy your bullet hit the wall but even after all of that you will have fun the whole bullet hit the wall thing be true and aiming help only a little bit but it be not terribly game break to the point of rage you even get a special load out in a game mode that let you be a support assault or two other class that give you benefit like drone strike and helicopter support need polish but it be free to play and it be not half bad,pos
4656,early access reviewif you do not watch the video that go along with the picture then you probably do not know this game mess with you and get really dark and creepy it be hard to decide if i should reccommend this game because its really creepy for a game call spookys house of jump scare,pos

4659,early access reviewone of the bes thing about this game be the free stuff you get your first win of the day give you a booster pack the short campaign give you 5 starter deck and you get some more free deck every week the game be very generous in give booster for example instead of buy booster for 1000 gold you can pay 2500 gold to play the game mode call the forge where you draft 25 card and can win up to 4 additional booster it play similar to like magic the gathering while only visually look like hearthstone you can get all the card without pay any money but it will be a huge grind anyway eternal be more mechanic friendly compare to hex but both be fun and different game if anything i would say eternal be more casual eternal still have a lot of advanced mechanic that you can find in mtg though the main advantage eternal have over hex that attract me to this game be that this game be available on mobile platform,pos
4660,pretty decent game for a ftp model people may say its p2w sure but nearly all card game be to begin with anyway even build real life meta deck cost you 100s of dollar to make overall though this game have some pretty nice graphic consider it be a mobile port gameplay be more simple than the other yugioh title because the maximum number of card be 30 and minimum be 20 in a deck i quite like this feature because it allow you to consistently get the draw you need to win your game this game may favor p2w player but ftp player have a good chance in beat them if they spend enough time into the game tutorial 9 good for beginner teach everything you need to know before you start graphic 7 pretty good for a mobile port be actually suprise gameplay 7 a bit more simple than an average yu gi oh game character 10 there be load of character from the first and second series that you can unlock and use with all there orginal english voice actor which actually suprise me aswell overall a 7 5 10 its a good game but it have its up and down as do many other card game kyouie,pos

4662,early access reviewthe game mechanic and the map be nice but i have two complain the first one be the low variety of gamemode i like demolition and assassination because they be something new but i get bored over time the second complain be that most weapon feel the same for example almost all sniper do one shoot and there be no reason to buy m107 which deal 100 damage because you can buy a normal sniper with credit and still do one shot while damage be like 94 or 96 thus feel the same the rifles and smgs fall to one of 2 category high rpm low dmg low recoil or low rpm high damage high recoil some of them have a grenade launcher but that do not matter that much there be only 2 shotgun and i feel that they be way underpowered shotgun should deal more damage and one shoot up to 1 m even when i play with the high damage shotgun i can not seem to one shoot even at point blank i have to say that i feel diffrent with each lmg but not by a lot pistol be ok i guess but i would suggest add some more,pos
4663,i have never write a review yet and the company who make this game just make me get this much out of my comfort zone recently they increase the cost of acquire in game content with in game nonbuyable currency while at the same time reportedly nerfe the income rate of mention currency mind you i be not talk about irl buyable currency a k a gold so i have not play for some time have a hard time grind enough of that nonbuyable currency to buy the next soldiertype and now after login they be again unreachable until i have grind some more this kind of price change have already happen to me at least once and never be mention beforehand so as a last measure i start to write this and after have send this comment i will uninstall this game let this be a warning to you possible new player if it happen to you tell you so i can not recommend this game any more,neg

4667,so attempt to play this game multiple time and i can not seriously stick with it the game have a ton of potential as a former game reviewer i can see it however the game have some serious flaw hold it back first the the spawn system you spend the majority of your time run back to the objective in this game which can take between 30 second to a couple of minute depend on the game mode you play spawn point be purposely place away from any nearby objective give the enemy team an advantage to setup defense before an attack you can only create a squad of 3 other member and then queue with random player good luck try to get any organization with your team when it come to attack a fortify objective most people run in by themselves get kill and then have to run back and it be just a loop of one person go in and die second the game economy this game manipulate you or seduce you to try and spend real money on their game want to progress faster spend money on their premium service which give you boost to progress faster the game have a huge grind specifically for this purpose silver the in game currency come slowly and you need a ton of it to even purchase upgrade which have durability by the way for your weapon weapon upgrade vehicle etc the amount of silver you need to spend outweigh the amount you earn in the game third and most of all the game lock the main feature the bread and butter of the game war mode behind a level restriction time gate the actual content of the game force you to queue for small arena like match that a handful of player be actually play as such queue time be rather long i spend anywhere between 1 5 minute try to find a match during the day and even longer at night if you be hope to play the open world war zone in this game guess what you need to get to level 10 first before you can experience that content oh and if you want to experience any of the game many class such as recon paratrooper etc you will need to spend over 100k on each class or pay real money to unlock them this game try heavily to encourage people to spend money on their game instead of focus on the content itself the freemium element to this game kill it be potential i leave the game on and off due to the war mode be lock behind a grind wall i can not justifiably support this game with it be current model and practice and highly recommend people go into this game to go in with caution,neg
4668,early access reviewok i do not know why this game be get so much hate its an awesome free to play shooter its not as good as counter strike global ofense but it run beautifully and the game itself be just really fun i highly recomend you at least try this game its really awesome,pos
4669,very fun unique take on a rpg basically where game like diablo and torchlight have you level up skill through a skill tree and add stat through gem socketable path of exile do the opposite you add stat through a huge stat tree and add skill to your class through socketable item really cool great atmosphere and lot of replay potential do i mention it be free,pos
4670,i actually do not recommend raceroom racing experience but i take a moment to look through some of the positive and negative review prior to write this and realize some thing which actually change my opinion of the game from the perspective of functional game content the one criticism i have which have not change be the sound i be not a professional racer i do not know what it sound like to be behind the wheel of one of these monstrosity but when i play a racing game with a 5 1 surround system i expect it to feel raw and powerful instead i find all of the vehicle to sound unbelievably anemic and whiny again i have no idea what these car may sound like in real life but this be a game its disappointing to see such aggressive speed machine yet hear whiny little rc car now one of the first thing i learn be that this be at least in some capacity the same people responsible for race07 i recently give that game a whirl and have a nauseatingly terrible experience with it whatever they learn from those past title they have clearly refine it and master it for raceroom i know a lot of time have pass between the two but its hard to think this quality sim be from the same people behind race07 great job dev keep up the iteration and self improvement the next thing i take a step back from complain about be the free to play model many of the negative review point out the frankly incomprehensible way in which content be be sell i think the model be confusing and poorly think out but i do not think the fact that you be expect to pay for the majority of the car when the game and a handful of vehicle be completely free be a point to merit a negative review the game be extremely detailed and as good i can tell extremely faithful to the physics behind circuit racing raceroom be not a free to play racing game in my eye its a demo for a well craft racing simulator that allow you to pay for exactly the content you want if you decide that the mechanic interest you i do not much enjoy it but raceroom racing experience be a free demo for a very high quality racing simulator if you be into this genre and like what you see in the screenshot you should absolutely try out the game there be literally nothing to lose by try it out,pos
4671,it be poorly optimize when i launch it just get 2 fps and i need to wait half a minute for it to render soo it get playable it crash 40 of the time when i try to join a world if it do not crash i lose connection to the server server be pure bullcrap gameplay bore it be just farm simulator with world of warcraft element level up be too slow and boring same dungeon with different layout same enemy with different modelsit be repetitive,neg
4672,if you want to have fun this game be not for you the game be tailor in a way that only by spend the most money in the game you can have a comptetitive deck maybe after play a year of f2p you can build a combo but by the time you do that the meta would have probably shift anyways so you will see the same deck at the top rank and even at low rank you can find people who obviously spend money on themed deck which be sad becase this game have potential to be very fun but instead it come out as another easy cash grab if you be go to spend money on card spend that money on the real card which at least have a value because this game server will be shut down sooner or later and i do not think anyone be get a refund,neg

4675,i do not get why everyone be complain about the fact that you have to pay to play most of the game that be a normal thing these day if you bother to pay and you will not pay more than a normal game to get 3 month plus a good range of gear and then it be really cheap to renew your licence whenever you miss the game it be an amazing beautiful hunting game it really be ultra real and if you be opposed to hunt real animal but can see the fun otherwise then this be the game for you it be the only game where you will walk and even crawl most of the time and enjoy it it be a game that make good find rare so when they come they be really rewarding and challenging there be a thrill in hunt an animal across the gorgeous huge map and make sure you do not spook it you also get to hunt with friend which be a great pasttime grab a beer get a good microphone and head out into nature with your buddy and enjoy good old fashioned manly hunting try it it be free to try that s the point and you do get to go on a great map and hunt a deer that be as fun as all the other animal you can even go on the other map and find other animal you just can not shoot them but you can photograph them and see if you want to invest ignore the spoiled brat that want everything free and give this game a go p s i have play for over 100 hour via the website rather than steam,pos

4680,early access reviewplaye this game after 50 hour be hell imagine bf4 but downgrade by 1000000000000000 yea this game be free but i would rather pay the 20 buck the game be worth than play this game the progression be super slow so it be go to take a while to get gun and well vehicle the only way to get around it be by pay for gold which be pay with real money one of the good weapon in the game be more than 10 buck what yep more than 10 buck for one gun again sorry for compare but if you pay another 10 buck you will get bf4 which have no t gold system and the progression be much faster another thing about this game be the balance btw balance be not even a thing in this game the gun fight be fairly balanced however but the vehicle just no tank and plane be way to op in this game since many people do not carry anti armor weapon this be because no one start with anti armor weapon regard your class and the rocket launcher be super expensive there be some aa gun on the map to take down the plane but it seem as if no one be use them side note the american standard grenade be super op as well another thing that factor into the poorly balanced game be the general basically anyone who spit out money can be a freakin general the role of these general be to provide you with specific squad in each battle each squad have its own purpose and you can only spawn certain vehicle in each squad which lead to very unbalanced combat i have have game where my team have have 6 tank spawn in and the other team only have less than 3 vice versa i have be on team where we have have no squad to spawn in vehicle lead us to get poope on i kinda feel like the other team just finish eat bad truck food and they poope out the spawn of satin and make our team eat it um yea bikesquadshoutout to my boi noah and neil for be the the bikesquad also shoutout to my favorite teacher mr galso shoutout to my boi justin the baller also shoutout to my boi franco horny guy also shoutout to my boi tom horny guy 2,neg

4692,early access reviewi have download this game through steam and my mobile phone and be try not to play it too much this game remind me a lot of magic the gathering i do not have anyone to play mtg with locally so this be a surprising and welcome find an excellent alternative to mtg consider my circumstance the different colored faction behave much the same as the different color of mtg so the game be very easy to pick up there be more play option available on this game than any mtg app i have find so replayability longevity be not a go to be an issue if you be in the same boat as me you like play mtg but do not have anyone to play with as often as you would like i highly recommend get this game there be many many similarity to mtg so you should not have an issue get the hang of the game and if you and your friend download this through steam you will have the enjoyment of play with your friend even if you do not live close to each other,pos
4693,i have not play this game in five year due to hardware issue so when i get a new computer i be excited to play this game again but the new update have xigncode which kick me from the game as so as it be launch i have look online for solution but all i find be make sure there be no background program run but elsword and steam be the only program running shame because i would have rate this a stellar 5 out of 5 sadly in its current state i would not recommend the byte this take up 0 5 unplayable,neg
4694,early access reviewi quite enjoy this game since i want to scratch my mtg itch it do a lot of stuff right the game speed be nice gui be enhance the experience and there be a sense of progression as you grind your way up what i do not like be unfortunately a core mechanic of the standard game dead draw how can they still be in a new card game it feel so punish draw resource card when you want some kind of answer for the board on top of that the deck size be 75 card with a maximum of 4 copy per card and you be force to make 1 3 of the deck resource card this game want you to use a more water down deck than mtg increase the rng and restrict your deck building even more i really feel this be a core problem with the game so much so that i would not recommend it from what i have see this be also the nail in the coffin for other player in my mind the fix for this problem would be allow hero avatar power the 5 campaign hero each already have their own 2 mana spell which have a little effect gain 2 armor and draw you a resource card why not make it a permanent ability also remove the 1 3 of deck force resource so people have more freedom to build i think i will spend a little more time with this game but once i be bored i will not revisit it again unless there be a core change that tackle the dead draw problem i only wish this promising game would stop stick with frustrating mechanic of the past or else it will die rather quickly,neg
4695,this be definitely a pay to win game i put in about 100 hour on android and i know that it be p2w from the start they rig the card you draw i literally fill it with mostly monster and only draw only my spell card in a row i have 50 monster and 50 spell trap and literally keep get only spell or only monster i even make it 70 monster and 30 spell trap and still get nothing but spell somehow i be only use the peak performance skill the entire time i even put multiple copy of the same card only to draw every other card except duplicate i even experiment my card draw with a friend only to draw every other card except for my most powerful card which be always conveniently place at the very bottom of my deck i have mostly play with my friend and they literally see it on my livestream that i would draw similar card during my 1st or 2nd turn and we even play about 30 40 match in a row only to happen every single time they even rig the dice roll card to give you the bad dice roll as much as possible because these card be so powerful that they would stomp most card that be mostly lock behind a paywall it go against their profit motive to simply rely on skill for use the right card at the right moment i have the dangerous machine type 6 and it literally give me a 6 dice roll 18 time in a row across all my match always self destruct my card each time i only get to use it to it be full effect only 2 time and the rest be nothing but 1 or 6 i mostly play with my friend and even when they have card more powerful than mine i have win more match against them this just prove how massively rig the rng system be and do my own personal research the math do not make any sense and pretty much force you to buy the most op deck behind the paywall if you be f2p be prepare to lose a lot of match and do a ton of grinding to unlock skill if you do not believe that the card draw be rig they literally have a feature call skill that can be apply to your character how be this a skill when you literally give a player an advantage to pull certain card out of theirthat cmpletely break the game what a joke here be a list of the skill below balanceif your deck consist of 10 monster card and 10 spell trap card you will have 2 monster and 2 spell trap in start hand draw sense spell trapcan be use each time your life point decrease by 1800 in the draw phase instead of do a normal draw draw a random spell trap card destiny drawcan be use each time your life point decrease by 2000 in the draw phase instead of do a normal draw draw the card of your choice draw sense high levelcan be use each time your life point decrase by 1800 in the draw phase instead of do a normal draw draw a random level 7 or more monster heavy starterif your deck have 3 or more level 5 or high monster with different name you will have improve chance of have a level 5 or high monster in your start hand,neg
4696,i start play this because i be under the mistaken assumption it provide unlock in fallout 4 it do not if you have the same misconception so why the negative review and the answer be that the game use tedium and enforce grinding as a gameplay mechanic and it do not have to the game concept itself be novel enough and if you like the fallout universe it be pretty cute it be simple but it be mean for mobile device so that make sense build a vault manage your settler fight baddie for loot rinse wash and repeat all of that be just well and dandy the problem arise from the fact that there be basically no ai and everything be agonizingly manual resource get produce gather those sucker manually loot get find gather that stuff manually danger at the vault manually tell people to go help and then go to the next room when the danger spread rather than remember why they be send ready to give birth not until the overseer deliver your kid themself it go on and on it be micromanagement without depth which mean that it be just a chore at the end of the day well that and wait the combat system be 95 wait and not whilst the app game be close sit there and watch healthbars slowly fall hope you will get a crit and somethingf to do and then they hit you with the pay content to make thing quicker easy and more automated you literally pay to play less and be bother less nothing against pay content they have a right to make money from their work but pay content should give you more of the game not less of the annoyance top tier weapon just less wait in combat you can bypass the whole process by not play it at all,neg

4703,oh where to begin with neverwinter now this review will most likely bring on a lot of controversy but who care neverwinter be a f2p mmorpg publish by perfect world now a lot of perfect world game tend to be pay to win to the extreme neverwinter be not pay to win unlike the other the only thing to win in neverwinter be pvp but pvp be not a big part of the game itself and there be no item you can pay real life money for to help you in pvp of course neverwinter have an in game currency call zen that you can pay real life money for but the only thing zen let you buy be fashion item dye companion mount and a few other item not essential to own now of course like many other mmo in game currency like zen can allow you to pay for convenience such as buy a fast mount mount serve no purpose other than get you where you need to go at a quick rate rather than walk be that pay to win no it be not what be you win a race to the quest area people do not like spend real life money on mmos but the game be free be it not so complain be silly anways the main currency in neverwinter that require no real life money to earn be call astral diamond you do not want to spend real life money on neverwinter have no fear with ad you can purchase companion mount and plenty of other neat item though for a price 25k ad be the max you can earn with your daily quest however every dungeon you play you have a 90 chance of obtain a purple item purple item sell for a fair amount of ad on the auction house whether its to 20k or 1mill so really earn ad be not an issue me i have play neverwinter since beta two year ago and have never spend a dime to get the cool item i desire i just play the game and earn ad which as state before be not as hard as people say it to be the point of play a game be earn what you want and work towards your goal but many be lazy and do not want to work for what they want i also forget to mention if you really want something off the zen market but have no desire to pay real life money for exclusive item on it do you know you can trade ad for zen be not that nice that neverwinter allow you to do that they give you every option in the game to get what you want without pay a single cent i do not know about you but that s very nice especially for a free game in game event also happen often and every event give you a chance to get a very unique item of some kind whether its so a very cool fast mount a strong companion or just a silly item like a portable throne now let talk about the worker behind neverwinter that be really a great group of people they constantly work hard daily to keep neverwinter run add new content very often and keep it bug free the employee be also very easy to get ahold of and they be the most helpful bunch that will assist you with anything you need its very important for a game to have that they also play neverwinter and they even take the time to play with player in game and occasionally help out people in need how cool be that they also stream on twitch often and give away in game item and even phsyical item like t shirt so overall neverwinter be one of the best free to play mmo out right now there be a reason i have be play this game since beta it even have an epic story line unlike many other mmos that do not like everybody else i skip dialog i do not care i just want to play with neverwinter everything about it whether its to the lore or story line be so very intriguing and make you want to really understand what s go on and pay attention neverwinter be also very visually stunning and the amount of work and detail put into this game be really quite amazing do not believe me check out my screenshot and look at my neverwinter one you will also see that i have an epic mount easily obtain by earn ad like mmorpg want a game full of endless content you can spend countless hour on do you like dungeon and dragon then take the time to play neverwinter,pos

4735,let start with a pro and con list of the game from someone who be not super big on free2play but choose to give this one a shot because it look decent pro the dev be constantly work on the game to make improvement and bug fix multiple game mode to appeal to a wide audience than just a handful option between first person and third person point of view amazing money point system where you gather money as you kill zombie and player and can use that money in the marketplace to buy thing like extra ammo gear vehicle etc and it be all stuff you can buy without pay real top dollar although they do have a real money form of currency for skin and to make your stuff look nifty but i mean come on it be a f2p they need to make money someway and honestly i would say this be not a p2w game due to the fact the bulk of what you buy be just bs skin like a knock off csgo thing talent tree be fun so as you gather exp from kill you can spend it to make you not lose health as fast hit harder less recoil etc gameplay be immensly impressive not choppy laggy at least not on the na server if you be in the middle of kill someone and they try to auto disconnect to save theirand so you do not get point it do not work there be a 10 second disconnect timer for when scumbag try to pull stuff like that you can log off whenever wherever you want you do not respawn in the same place regardless of if you connect to the same server would love to see more map but hey it be already an amazing f2p and even with just the few map they have i never find them repetitive or boring because it be all about survive and while play you be always so into just do that that whatever map be choose do not even matter while you be run for your life from a horde of zombie or a player whom you think be friendly and be now chase you down the street in nothing but a motorcycle helmet while wield a machete so many pro but i would like to go have a smoke break so onto the con this game be basically just a compton simulator or a canada simulator i do not know both place suck run down building and tweaker or zombie roam the street suck you have to pay real mulah to get cool skin on your gun but aye just like cs semi cancerous community but there be always those few really cool guy to group up and run with when you die you drop all your stuff which suck but aye that s part of the game get over it or get off much love to the dev for be ontop of their stuff with bug fix and update you guy be amazing and this be one hell of a game for a f2p smoke break time stinky pete,pos
4736,try to master gun be so fun in this game i like to put on some music and just pick apart tec 9s and aks and see how much i can do before i mess up its hard to progress and the gun be not as plentiful as the pic make them look but the game be free so top do not listen to negative reviewer and just try it,pos
4737,discount hearthstone bad aggro deck everywhere they ruin the game and if you do not spend real money you be go to be far behind twitch drop be a thing but they be a joke the drop rarely show up and if you they do they give you crap do not bother with this game the first hour playing be fun but after the campaign the game show its true color,neg
4738,uhm this little masterpiece should not be free of charge for what it offer it be really quite an amazing survival game kudo to bethesda keep up the good work 9 10 be a fallout fan since 98,pos
4739,do not play this game the game itself be really amazing well done and really enjoyable but konami really fail this time it be free and this mean that you can play without spend money and this make your deck build time extremely longer i spend personally 30 day play hard to create my free deck but the point be that for this kind of deck you need skill you can get the skill by defeat the legendary duelist in game now after 49 day of duel vs legendary duelist with a very high average of scoring point 7 8k 8k be the max i do not have the skill yet and it be not buyable or obtainable by increase lvl moreover the ultrarare and super rare drop rate be ridiculous even score 8k of duel point vs a lvl 40duelist i score the max a lot of time and i have even not see a single super rare skill for the most of time people play the game to have fun for hobby and to pass a good timec in my opinion 79 day to create a deck and i be work n progress be definitely too much be not fun anymore moreover 3 pack cost 2 29 and every pack contain 3 card for the digital card be insane you can not even buy the exact card or skill konami should increase the drop rate and the skill obtain process to make this game consistent and funny i kown their aim be make money but this make the game annoy you spend money ok create more deck and faster you send no money no competitive game age of tme to create a consistent and effective deck just to let you know my sta up to date 79 day of play most in android 3824 duel almost 20k of diamond use for deck no skill seriously,neg
4740,early access reviewthis game be literally everything pubg should have be on launch this game also have an interesting end game scenario instead of be the last player alive to achieve victory a heli fly down and drop a ladder and offer extraction for a total of 4 passenger to escape from the blizzard you may think well that be not too much fun player will just camp the ladder up into the heli that be true however to keep that playstyle from be abuse too much after a certain amount of time player be reveal on the map force a potential extraction or intense gunfight while in pubg it be whoever can stay prone the long until you spot a potential kill great idea and for me personally well execute it bring some freshness to the genre gun play be great too also the game be fast than pubg but it be not over in 10 minute either it be just the right amount of time there be so much more but i will let you all explore this game yourself of course the game have it be problem too as many do some minor frame drop and lag here and there from what i have experience but it be not game break at all nor a reason not to play it note i be compare this to pubg because they be so damn similar an many many way and i feel this game do it all 1 000 time well and it be free 10 10,pos
4741,i have previously play the game i like it and re instal it but i have some graphical issue like glitch also game freeze sometimes i have amd grahics card it be say that these glitch be because of amd graphic card it be the programmer job to make compatible game to amd card so i uninstalle the game i do not recommend the game if you amd card else the game be not bad,neg
4742,you do not need to pay hundred of dollar to enjoy this game you can get the starter membership bundle for 15 and get three month of licence to hunt all animal and two weapon along with unlimated basic ammo three of which exclusive for the shotgun you can hunt all big game with slug round and all small game with birdshot and 12ga buck so with that you can already hunt all the specie in the game i have get the 15 starter membership and i have already take down most of the specie without have to buy any special gear beyond what i get with the base game and starter membership if you enjoy hunt and would not mind drop 10 every three month then this game be for you if you do not have 10 to drop every three month then maybe check out cotw which be a one time purchase but imo not as fun as thc in it be current state,pos
4743,early access reviewi mean it have a okay storyline but the graphic be just uhg i mean its a free game what do you expect its good for mess around in but not for a genuine game not to mention how small it be,neg
4744,play this game for year it be one of my favourite game and while the dev can put out some fantastic work they sadly seem to be at this point incredibly out of touch with the game and it be community get to top tier will literally take thousand of hour of incredibly slow and painful grinding and when you finally reach top tier it be terrible truly aweful top tier consist of get slaughter by helicopter while you be powerless to stop it unless you have enough point to spawn a fighter jet get one shot from the other side of the map in your spawn and horribly balanced vehicle that completely dominate anything that be not metathe list go on and on but there be just so many issue that ruin this once amazing game that i love so dearlyplease do not buy into the money grab that this game have become now and spend your time do something more enjoyable,neg
4745,probably the best competitive game make in any genre will be play by human forever it be a steep learning curve but it be the game we will watch world cup in when we be retire so you better learn it now oh and do i say its the most fun to play since you be back to square one in every game and 40 minute be enough of a grinding span require teamplay twitch skill lore understanding tactic strategy awarness ball good judgment reaction anticipation intuition time sense people sense empathy multi tasking spatial and temporal awareness and focus,pos
4746,play this game for 3 day due to the free 3 day premium and then get rid of it from your steam library the entire game be base around premium feature such as premium ammo premium consumable and buy your way to the top convert free money to premium ammo be non sustainable even if you do win with top gun and 10 other medal and start off with free crew be just ask to be farm for 100 game because 50 crew be so blind that they can not even see a tank in front of them even if they be 100 meter in front of you in plain sight and no camo bonus when you do get to the top you will eventually realize that the only reason you put so much effort into this tiering up be because you want to play a game where player have a even advantage but you end up realize that high tier game be exclusively for wallet warrior,neg
4747,smite be an amazing game but hi res be the bad they make too many stun mechanic some god be break af and just annoying to play against i also always get new player as a team and more experienced player as enemy which can be very annoying when you want the quest daily reward please fix,pos

4749,early access reviewhonestly there be a bug where it get stick on the authorization screen but sometimes you just need to refresh the game it be a very fun game after that there may be a lot of hacker but sometimes there be not i fully recomend this game if you do not have enough money for csgo or call of duty,pos
4750,just to get this straight this game be just like freak minecraft but positively like minecraft the game start off as a tutorial and when your in the tutorial you get to pick between a variety of class originally the main class you got to pick in the beta of the game when it first start be a knight a gunslinger a candy barbarian or a dracolyte classesknight mainly use for tanking can withstand many enemy great damage close range have a passive skill that when hit your next attack deal more damage the great thing about knight it be good for soloing but damage be not that great gunslinger have an advantage at range use a gun good for damage have a passive skill that when shoot in the air while attack an enemy in the air while airborne your next charge shot will be instantly charge without cost candy barbarian mainly use melee weapon as an advantage close range can withstand many enemy skill provide healing and can hit multiple target good for damage or for solo dracolyte this be most likely a overrated class in my opinion but i be not say the other three class be bad but this class have just get more advantage and it be just so overpowered to use use a staff and the freaking skill be a flamethrower that last forever until the enemy die the most awesome thing about the last or ultimate skill of this class be that you get to transform into a fire breathe dragon that be most powerful than your flamethrower and it can literally annihilate everything well i be just exaggerate if you know what gear to equip also in trove you get to build your own house and make cool pixel like pokemon and other stuff which be like the thing you need to build in minecraft but your go to have to mine for block just to build stuff in that case the game be fun building be enjoyable and have a fire breathe dragon be the most cool thing i have ever see in my life,pos

4760,early access reviewwhile this game be great consider its beta i feel that onve you hit the corruption level the exploration stop and there s nothing leave to do but build i would very much like to see several more layer add to the world each with its own unique biom and material you need to harvest to get to the next level below other than that i would very much encourage you to pick this game up soley for the multiplayer aspect like the free server save to steam so you can play on a friend server without them be online 10 10 would grief my friend again,pos
4761,this be by far the good game i ever play whoever say that tf2 be die andis wrong because of 1 or 2 bad update do not mean the game isand we as the community should know that and support valve for keep alive this masterpiece but instead you just quit the game because you be never happy with what you have,pos
4762,this be a dissapointing game i be a fan of the film and tv series and this game be a let down it do not feel like a well make game for pc and i bet it be a port from the mobile market i fly hookfang in the early training mission and i know paper plane which have more weight to them than that dragon you play as some randomer viking and the goal be to be the ultimate dragon trainer but that not that intersting a goal it be a mmorpg be what the game be ruin by in my opinion they could have have the main cast as playable character and have adventure like in the show it have the music from the series and the character and that be well model so they have that but i do not want to play it for long before it put me off the series,neg
4763,early access reviewthe game use to be good trust me you do not want to play i have be keep up with the patchnotes and some other stuff relate to it only because i be too lazy to unfollow them on facebook the patch seem to be follow the pattern i see in the day lead up to my departure from the playerbase about a year ago i have notice their desperate attempt to add band aid feature and balance that be mean to appease their fan and keep them around and have them pay 2 win the dlc be not worth their cost at all 35 dollar for a flyer that will not last 5 second in a match lmao and 50 for premium wtf at most its worth 10 at most i have sink so many hour into this game because once upon a time it be a good game and then they slip on the stair and fall down into the depth of hell itself how idk supposedly at some point freejam be in major debt to its parent company and so they introduce the crate system as a way to convice player to buy crate and premium in order to pay off their parent company since they be still around it seem like that work even though it should not have the crate system be literally a fester cancer as they add new item that be cancer to use the reward pool grow decrease your chance of get anything decent then again the drop rate be rig in a way that very rarely do something decent drop and it be most likely in the premium row of item so you need to be feed them money in order to get it premium be never worth the price in the early day all it do be double your currency income which mean that you could sealclub all the newbie as a newbie back then i can say that sealclubbing be a very common occurence it take me 6 month thank to that to actually get to the mid tier after a while they add color so that you could color your bot however you want and of course there be a catch you need premium to get more than 3 color white an ugly sky blue and an ugly off orange and after crate you need premium to get decent item or in most case more item to sell at what feel like pawnshop to save up your penny for that badass weapon that be the current meta but thank to the pawnshop like sell it would take you literally year to save up enough to get 1 of that item let alone the 3 or 4 you would need for it to be viable and by that time the dev would have initiate at least 4000 different meta in the early day everything be relatively balanced of course there be way to exploit it but it be not that bad after a while the game become extremely unbalanced addition of new movement type and or weapon so they do some quick patch to fix that r i p balance that set the game into a death spiral of cancerous meta while that may sound bad on paper its far bad in reality bad than a plane spiral to the ground while its tail section and one of its wing fall silently beside it there be the over tiered tank tank build with low tier armour and equip with gun from many tier above the armour possible because of the way your bot tier be determine so slap some tier 2 armor on then slap some tier 7 gun on go rek the tier 4 people ggez but tier be remove so good bye over tiering then come the flak cannon rip flyer of all kind then come rocket rip everything then come the hover with the tiny corner triangle i forget what they be actually call which zip around in the sky be invisible and obliterate everything then come the ultra tanky mech absorb all the damage and destroy everything then come the shotgun then come the tiny cloak tesla melee basically bot after that i leave no surprise really i be sure there be be even more cancerous meta since i leave too sad thing be there be probably more than i think which be say something cause i think its a ton there be always be build restriction you have never be able to build what you want its sad really because there be so much potential in the concept you want to know the sad part of the entire popularity of this game even the most popular robocraft youtuber rosefall leave because he get feed up with how much the game have drift from its good ole day rosefall have move on to big and well thing you can search up his channel if you want to see what happen for yourself really the only remain popular robocraft youtuber be gromek999 and jac733 i can only assume that they be pay by freejam to continue make video that shed a positive light on this game i do not know how anyone could make a positive video on robocraft anymore even if they be pay they could pay me 10mil a video and i still would refuse to brainwash the uneducated young into waste their life and their parent money on such a game in conclusion do not waste a single second on this game but even more importantly do not spend a single penny on this game freejam do not deserve your money,neg
4764,i download this on the second beta run my son and i thoroughly enjoy play this one of the feature i most appreciate be that i can play it on my tablet pc or iphone however i must say my hat go off to anyone who have master play this on their phone i also appreciate the fact that the developer have make this available for free and that you can easily play win and progress without pay to play since i do not believe anything should be free and we enjoy play this so much i have happily spend my hard earn cash in the game which enable you to enjoy more tank and fast experience i be sure many die hard wot fan will consider this trivial in comparison to the full game but for those of us who like to pop in and out for a quick distration now and then it be a perfect format we enjoy play this game so much we start our own clan mayhm look us up when your in the game and feel free to appy for membership we will be dissmisse many member with preference towards player from steam look me up metalmayhemmasterhappy hunting,pos

4773,i would like to say this mmo be great it have a wonderful system that be in place which be the ability to create your own map for the game if you be tired of the content that have be create many people feel it be a pay 2 win game it be not unless you make it that way that be the real situation overall though there be nothing that you can not do in the game to play it and get to the same level as everyone else the situation be how much you want to devote to the game to get to whatever progress you as a player want however as a free to play game there be a lot of free content that a person can go into and i recommend to eventually get into a guild or make sure you do all the require high level content to get some of the well gear i know recently there be some network issue but i believe it have smooth itself out some and have become playable again i recommend this game to the hardcore or even the casual player because the quest be instance base but very quick at time it be only the raid that be a little longer and more involve also make sure to do your daily but everything be solid for that mmo and recommend it to anyone,pos
4774,i decide to give this game a try and i end up around 20 minute walk among tree and grass i manage to find some building area just to realize they be crowd with zombie i could not find a weapon anywhere only food and some armor and the basic backpack have only a few slot so i could not even pick everything it be a dreadful and tedious experience i spend 95 of the time sprint try to find a weapon or someone in a full server i do not die at all but definitely not the survival experience i be hope for,neg
4775,in a pvp game it be important that each player have to at least play by the same rule this be not the case with this game certain game mechanic be different for different operating system this give an advantage to mobile gamer by necessity i would not recommend this game it be a naked cash grab and on a pc you have little change against a mobile gamer who be not absolutely terrible i be a fan of tower defense game and the bloon series be very disappointed uninstalle now,neg

4779,early access reviewthis be the most stable game in alpha i have play with that in mind it be natural to expect the game to change many time before beta they have change revert a few thing so take some of the overtly critical review with a grain of salt realm be a formidable offering in the genre give more reliable shooting than fortnite without the building while bring the addition of class skill for more variety,pos
4780,early access reviewlet me preface this with the fact that i have play this game for year now i start this game when the only mode you could play be training and battle there be no respawns and no objective other than to kill the other team and have the good robot i love this game allow me to walk you through my experiance 1 spend 50 hour grind to level 100 with friends2 spend 50 hour and some money to support the dev grind and come up with an amazing megabot idea3 spend 70 hour and some money to keep the subscription up build your megabot and grind for money for parts4 new update oh loot drop uh ok oh my megabot be entirely red why oh no cpu they remove megabot thank for ruin a game dev if you want thisto come back as a playable game you need to remove all these update bring it back to what the game use to be about creation and imagination as for right now do not give these people money or time this game have go from an amazing free team base sandbox vehicle battleground to another fine example of terrible dev,neg

4782,i like game like this personally not for everyone but it be nice to pass the time with only thing i would like be if the outfit and weapon come in a pack like the hair instead of have to pay for them separately and also make it cheap if keep individual i would be more willing to actually buy them in support of the dev overall a fun and simple game,pos
4783,early access reviewthis game be really really good although it do not really bring anything new on the table it manage to create solid balance and interaction on its own and i would definitely recommend it as an alternative to mtg this game could be the next big tcg if more people be willing to try it,pos
4784,early access reviewthe tldr here be that if you be look for something less broken and trash than pubg but you do not quite want to play fortnite with 12 year old then i guess this game have you cover oh and no you be not that good it be just that this game backfill match with bot this be another battle royale game it be right there in the title right next to realm realm royale be not really do anything new or exciting outside some minor tweak to the gameplay of your standard battle royale game you drop into the map from an airship you land find chest to get weapon and ability then you kill your way to be the last person or squad stand one thing realm royale do do differently be the class sytem in similar game you more or less drop in as the same person no one person have some edge over the other except for skill and mastery of the glitch in the game in realm royale however there be 4 class mage assassin hunter and warrior they each play the exact same and can use the same weapon and abiltie however they do have small buff to certain weapon if use and drop into the map with different starting movement ability the mage can fly the assassin can blink the hunter and dodge roll and the warrior have a super jump there be some other movement abiltie such as invisibility or a charge attack but those will have to be forge during the round or find in random chest the other thing the game do slightly differently be the life system in other game when you take too much damage you go into a bleed or down state and have to be revive by a squadmate or in the case of solo queueing die instantly you can be further damage in this downed state and kill but eventually you will bleed out if someone doenst revive you in realm royale however when you go down you just turn into a chicken you can still move and take cover albeit with reduce movement and unable to defend yourself and eventually you will b e back in fighting shape if you be not kill while you be in chicken form you can be chickene 3 time before you die for good but then you can still be revive by a squad memeber at a forge grant they can afford the revive and be not kill before the rez timer count down i will say that the choice to put loot inside independantly lootable chest be a great idea it stop me from miss thing on the ground because i do not notice the muddy black texture on top of the muddy brown and it stop the friendship destruction by make them independatly lootable so there be no debate over who get what you can share the loot if you do not want it and the game smartly place a pickup timer to stop people from steal yourif you turn your back for a microsecond but after the timer run out it be free game this system be actually pretty good i think they need to do a well job let me know which loot be mine in a pile of new item but overall it be decently well implement i mention above that this game backfill with bot this be something i do not know go in but become really obvious after a single match bot often run straight at you and either have pre cognition and aimbot or get stick on geometry and just eat bullet until they die this game do not have a lot of player right now so i imagine a large portion of the match i play be over half fill with bot often the last few player be the only real human in the match to begin with i be not really upset with this because it mean that you will not be queue forever if the game can not matchmake enough people but it be something to be aware of heres the thing right if you want another battle royale game there be probably bad option out there somewhere but right now this game only do just enough to differentiate itself that i would only reccomend it if you have a couple of friend willing to download it with you,pos
4785,early access reviewit be a great game with plenty of thing to scare you the scary for me be the violent deer and that deer god thing the game would be well if it have full controller support other than that it be perfect it be startling scary and spine tingle not for the average gamer oh and if you though five night at freddys be bad try this have fun,pos

4794,early access reviewsimple beat em up sidescroller game very smash bro like whilst its nothing new its definitely special and consider its free everyone on steam should definitely grab a couple friend and give brawlhalla a spin,pos
4795,early access reviewthis game be a mix of cod and cs go the game be not that bad and it do not take much time to get the hang of it because you do not need any skill to play some thing need to be improve and fix like the authorization screen the spawn camping add anti cheat system because it be full of hacker and also die randomly and say that i be kill by my self when those little bug be fix i will give the game a positive review 12 10 would get kill by my self again,neg
4796,  i have never hear of the new z before it come out on steam and try it out for the first time yesterday first off i want to say this game be free meaning there should be no reason for you to listen to review you should play it and see if you like it or not for a free game it be actually alright there be no pay to win element what so ever except be able to buy premium which be like unturned premium yes you can buy med and ammo for real life money but you can also do so with ingame money which be easy to get in my 3 hour i have well over 150 grand which be more than 20 dollar can buy this game be mainly pvp with med that have cool down to use during fight barricade to block off bullet and a sweet arcade feel for combat that be not realistic at all kill zombie be quite rewarding as well and there be a skill gap in this game you can find clan that go in together and run part of the map on server so skilled gamer will enjoy this game remember this be not a survival game but a shooter with zombie where you find loot like meds armor gun etc and then go to pvp that be the whole game but it be fun to play and free all negative reviewer be e stupid or be rate this way to harshly overall 7 10 fun to play with friend every now and then and free,pos
4797,great first person shooter with massive map and massive battle with potentially hundred of player on each side there be 3 faction vanusovereignity neoconglomerate and terrainrepublic vs be sci fi style with hovertank and plasma weapon their weaponry be mix nc be mercenary with gauss weapon their main battletank be close to normal tank they have heavy emphasis towards shotgun tr be the empire they use regular weaponry and tend to have large clip on their weapon their main battletank have 2 barrel the good quality of ps2 be that its sandbox style you can do what ever you want if you like to play with other people you can join someones squad or start your own quality of playing with squad depend on 75 leader and 25 member in my opinion you can go solo and still be part of large battle take potshot at the fringe or even infiltrate enemy basis and cause havoc there planetside 2 be free to play so you can use real money to buy stuff however everything that actually affect gameplay can be unlock by play within reasonable amount of time you can trial any weapon for 1h per day most weapon be sidegrade and most stock weapon be actually quite good have large arsenal mean that you can tackle wide variety of situation i would say ps2 be pay for convenience and pay for bling this be a great incentive to actually buy their stuff and support the continued existence of planetside 2,pos

4799,early access reviewmaybe no for now well i be a fan of aqw and i get excited when i hear that ae will go to create a 3d version this game be not bad at all the only problem for me be the control when i move my mouse to move the camera to the side its also zoom in at the same time i hope that the next update will fix that problem overall not bad at all for a classic mmorpg,neg
4800,be with elsword since 2012 the game now be basically a chore if you be into pvp or want to do the end game dungeon properly because it will take you week if not month to grind up decent level gear just for the dungeon pvp be no well now that the character balance be super wack because you now have 11 character with their own weakness and strength some with more strength either a character spamme you with magic skill x or that super fast flying character against a character that can not even double jump pro fun story cute and amazing character and graphic community be pretty good if you get pass some of the salt dungeon be fun like 10 character slot so you can try basically all the character if you want good time killer con you will get into routine of log on for an hour or two to do the daily quest and log off until you can actually enjoy the game properly unbalanced pvp and weapon balance microtransaction to restore gear once break limited edition costume and mount not require but a bit too pricey after a while very repetitive after you make 3 more character to level 99,neg
4801,early access reviewit be a grind game not a wwii game there be wwii era content everything hide under a paywall or an awful grind or both the grind be so preposterous that it make world of tank and war thunder feel light on the grind aspect for your sanity do not play it or you will wish you have your waste hour back i know i wish i have my 9 hour back,neg
4802,i have a love hate relationship with this game although it be free ish be an old starfox veteran i get on well with the arcadey action in the early game out manoeuvre enemy and chop their wing off with the target lead system each nation have a different set of plane each with their own strength and weakness although these do not matter too much at this early stage needless to say the bi plane stage be great fun then gradually i progress into the mid war era of aircraft this be fun too for a while but then i start to notice a change in the play style of my team mate and my opponent instead of roll away from each other to engage in a dogfight my opponent would just fly straight towards my plane gun blaze then plough straight through me like a batter ram killing both of us with no point score either side get use to these head on collision they happen a lot and not just with enemy sometimes you will be chase a plane only to find that a cloud of friendly player have form around you fixate on the same target try to nab the kill before you do because of this tunnel vision eventually a team mate will collide with you then call you a f king rammer n00b for your trouble lovely my main problem with this outcome be that there be very little penalty to prevent it on either side so the conflict just develop into a war of attrition to see which side have buy the most plane to aimlessly throw into the meat grinder alternatively you will get lock in a dogfight with a superior plane usually a spitfire with its well turning circle and no friend will be around to get it off your tail because 10 of them will be chase 1 bomber and crash into each other and yell expletive in the chat box i get the impression that the game want me to spend money to buy super upgrade for my plane to make them pointlessly unbeatable like in world of tank or create a squadron of other people who enjoy get ram by their team mate however my review system be base off the capacity enjoy a game even if you be a friendless hobo so if you be look for some quick arcade dogfighting action this game be one for you however if you be a fan of aviation look for a dedicated team base stress buster you will find this game utterly infuriating they will eventually add tank and ship into the mix but until then i be not convinced sorry warthunder you only get 4 10 golden badger egg,neg
4803,this be so bull i start play 2 day ago and i love it i really do and i get my computer for several certain game and this be one of them and they make it really sad because i be really hope that i could 1 day get a hat from a random drop but no that dosent exist anymore and the matchmaking be complete shyt i have not be able to get into a single match and they make it like a moba if you leave you get penalize and that be complete bullshyt so you know what you valve you have take a amazing game and throw it away ok because i would rather spend 100 upgrade my computer so i can play overwatch than play this piece of shyt ok because you need to pull your head out of your ass and start compete with overwatch ok and you have the potential ok but its to late the damage be do you just lose so many peole within a hour of this update release ok so if you fix these thing i may play again but you be so frustrating you never listen to anyone why be this here be the thing you fuqed up and i do not think it will come back and what s sad be that i finally be get good with spy and scout but you ruin it ok and i do not think i can forgive you guy for it this game be amazing and you manage to ruin it i i be just really disapointed you need to think before you do ok and start listen to your fan or you be go to lose alot of them this game be fill with amazing people and you let alot of them down just please start listen and be more mindfull of the thing your fan want honestly t t,neg

4808,notepreviously i have write a review of this game which be severely negative and be base on other negative review i do not bother play the game at first due to be unable to connect to any world and it turn out that the problem be from my isp i have to use a vpn to be able to play the game otherwise i would be spamme with connection time out also what be the deal with some people state that the shop be annoy nothing happen with me additionally this game be not pay to win at least so far i have not see anything that make you win i be still new to this game so this review be definitely go to be update in the near future creativerse and minecraftlet me just clear up one thing many people here compare this game to minecraft and think that this game be a clone of it well it be not heres why minecraft be a voxel base game and so be creativerse however many of the core element between creativerse and minecraft be completely different and irrelevant to each other if this game feature pickaxe and mob such as skeleton and zombie then you can say it be try to copy minecraft but it do not an example of a minecraft clone would be minetest that be clearly a minecraft clone both game vary in play style even when they be both base on the same concept compare minecraft to creativerse be like compare apple an orange classic example stop call it a minecraft clone moron the review creativerse be a voxel base survival game with good lighting animation water effect as well as toon graphic every new player that first look at this game judge immediately that this game be similar to minecraft and it be note the difference between clone and similar the game be fully online and as such nothing be store in your computer as you first enter this game you will be immediately assign a world that be store online and not in your computer what be lovely be that you can allow other player to join your world and you can also join other people world i be go to review the ui play style and some element of the game i find intriguing note that i just start play this game and already i be start to see how wrong i be when i first make that terrible review user interfacethe user interface be pretty compare to many game the developer put some effort into make everything pretty and nice to look at everything be well organized craft interface be neat and the craft system be simple but it can be easy to get lose in thankfully there be a search option play styleplay style of the game be unique each player start with a touchstone that could be use to teleport an infinite amount of time and other player can also teleport to them rather than use your traditional crafting table to create other item you need to craft a processor that process your material into other material ore in this game require to be mine use a device call an ore extractor rather than use the mining device when you run and stop you do not stop immediately you slightly slide forward combat be tough and tricky even pig attack you and land a hit without get hurt be difficult but possible element of the game i like blueprintsi love the blueprint but what i do not like be that only the developer can supply blueprint but other player can not hopefully in the future player would be able to share their own creation for other to build out of,pos

4814,this game although be around a very cube like style like other game minecraft cube world etc be atleast 85 different and unique in it be own way here be some pro and con pro there be many class to choose from range from a fly fairy like woman to a barbarian that wear and use candy as a weapon there be an rpg aspect to the game have to mainly break through dungeon and beat boss to earn loot you can also goto a city of neon light and ask around for quest from different creature around the city to earn point and thing you can use in some shop to buy item endless fun this game have so many thing to do in it that it be to the point of almost endless gameplay there be so many class to level up there be mastery point which can be earn to get a mastery rank which can get you cool prize there be club world you can make to hang out with friend or build there be hundred of style of clothing and costume for your character and so much more i can not even start to explain everything not 100 pay to win there be alot of thing that you can buy easily but can craft in game with just more difficulty con some thing be a little too pricy and can not be craft in the game have to spend money on game if you want to get something fast etc make progress start off easy and then become extremely hard make a learning curve that exponentially increase but sudden decrease at high rate make you want to quit the game and not come back for awhile option have no graphic setting make it hard for slow computered people to even play even while use a good pc or a good ps4 this game still lag a ton and can be quite annoying cool thing take extremely notice i say extremely long to get if you do not want to pay for it,pos

4818,go big or go home poe be at its core all about rng rng loot drop be the core game mechanic as one person put it fight loot find monster the game have plenty to recommend it great graphic inspiring sound music a deep meta game whereby the number of possible character build be nearly endless great customisation and the good mtx system i have yet see in a game where 95 of all item that can be purchase with real money be purely cosmetic in nature the other 5 be quality of life item that do not in any way make poe pay to win this be how all game company should do microtransaction my problem with poe be that the nature of the rng system mean that actually useful item be incredibly rare the entire game economy appear to be design with the 1 twitch broadcaster in mind who play thousand of hour of poe nothing else that be fine but it essentially lock an actually significant amount of the game content behind difficulty wall that can only be breach by spend huge amount of time play if like me you have very limited gaming time between real life stuff work family etc then i would seriously recommend that you will likely only find frustration in this game and you should look elsewhere my 500 hour at the time of writing have be accumulate over the past 5 year if you be willing to put in the time the sheer range of possibility that poe offer and the deep meta game be very rewarding and for these player poe be the good arpg available if however you have limit gaming time or play casually then do not bother you be not the target audience for this game unfortunately would i recommend poe yes but only because i enjoy play with my friend this be not a game that i play solo because the sheer size of the mindless grind to get the good gear be frankly unbelievably boring,pos

4832,early access reviewrealm royale be an enjoyabe battle royale game i strongly recommend this game because it be fun and be unique i say that realm royale have show to be unique because it have add it be own twist to the casual battle royale genre by use the forge class selection horse and by remove the parachute system the game be new so it will have a bug here and there as i have come across a few bug but they have not seriously effect my experience play the game if i be to say for anything to change it would be customisation like change the appearance or just small combat statistic change even though i know that this will probably be add in soon anyway,pos
4833,the game be fairly buggy but the developer appear to be work quickly to resolve them the game also try to solve the issue that the original monopoly have feature in the game allow for a quick game limit it to 15 minute maximum and the revised chance card can allow you to free up already claim property prevent stalemate that last hour 7 10 need work but be definitely worth give a try,pos
4834,this game be disgustingly unbalanced unless you be play the germans or russians you have no chance the ally tank be garbage and useless you can be penetrate from any angle while you have to hit a small specific area on the german and russian tank to penetrate they say its realistic but why do not the ally have 40 tank a match and the germans have 10 maybe if you be a pro you may be able to have a good time but for casual or new player its,neg

4837,summary this game be imo the good of its kind the late free mini expansion for path of exile release later today so it seem like a good time for me to recommend it on the face of it this game be your standard diablo clone but even though it be not as flashy as diablo 3 its depth customisation and replayability ultimately make it rise above the competition the combat be fun and challenge the game have a slow start though that be one of the issue be address in todays expansion but once the combination of skill and variety of environment become apparent it really come into its own the skill tree be huge really absolutely massive and offer countless build customisation option which be in complete contrast to e g diablo 3 you can combine skill gem to give your skill different effect sort of like rune in d3 but much deep i enjoy the loot and itemisation much more than other game in the genre too because of the possibility of craft and improve any trash item that drop the replayability be fantastic new challenge league be launch every few month which offer the option of an economy reset and always change the game in interesting way they also usually adjust the balance of the game it can be a bit flavour of the month ish regularly which mean that different build be enticing and since build play very differently this also help replayability then there be race short and challenging event of between 12 min and three hour which offer a unique challenge and a nice way to get into competitive online gaming in a non pvp setting race season run for six week or so every few month with several event per day and unique reward poe be free to play but never pay to win it have one of the good business model of any f2p game microtransaction be cosmetic or functional e g visual skill effect stash tab and the base offering be among the most generous i have see in a f2p game poe dev be responsive and down to earth and regularly interact with player on reddit and the forum give them your money there be also plenty of little thing e g the game take on health mana flask which be so obviously well than the implementation in other game in the genre that it be very hard to go back to the impoverished version of those feature in other game there be still thing that need improve the trade system need work for instance and desync can be a problem in certain circumstance but these be only small negative compare to the positive,pos

4855,so i play this game back when you pay for it once and then play it be good the environment be not complex but it have enough in it to make ship position interesting and strategically relevant there be just a handful of ship to choose from and they be distinctly different from each other both visually and functionally the community of player be pretty fun to play with too now the game be free but actually not the current total cost of all dlc be 179 96 the game be not good jump from one tiny box to another make everything feel cramped and more congested than before fly now feel like drive in los angeles ship positioning be mostly irrelevant because there be very few long sight line leave the ship design have get lazy and it be hard to tell one conglomeration of plate and girder from another anymore and the player community well read the other negative review most of which be well think out and write by experienced player and then read the comment on them the people who attack the writer of those review personally instead of read and respond to the criticism that be the current player base it be like play with all the people you know and love from youtube comment the recent update be a pretty naked cash grab and do not make the gameplay better than it be pay to win and lootboxe this sort of thing be so disgusting it should result in developer be ostracize by the game community at large ea would probably give you a medal though maybe if you be hurt for money you could sell out to them i be sure you all would get along famously,neg

4860,a free to play game with seasonal update decent lore and detailed game mechanic so much so that you may need to consult forum guide every now and then also fan site like poe planner and poe trade be very useful for gameplay that say the longer you play and the more time you invest into this game the more likely you will buy microtransaction to expand your stash fancy up your exile outfit and more pretty decor for your hideout however i think it be a fair trade consider again this game be free and none of the microtransaction you purchase have any significant bearing on actual game play a balance that big aaa publisher with much large budget do not seem to understand my one gripe at time of review be that exile voice acting and npc dialogue unique to each of the exile class be absent from the fall of oriath onwards it be those little detail of immersion that make the game more fun to play yknow,pos

4865,early access reviewyou have to remember just how early in development the game be before you complain about lack of content amongst several other thing this developer always release game very early in order for player to send suggestion as to form the game in to what people will enjoy through the little time i have so far play there be a lot of repetition and such very basic quest you may be ask to kill a specific enemy enough time for example only for the next quest to be kill the same enemy for item drop many many thing be still in very early development here and its very easy to tell however for say how early it be what be already here be great the scenery be very pleasing to look at enemy model look good and the animation be very smooth for both enemy and player model if you want to really enjoy an in depth mmo with many feature wait a while then pick this up if however you want to see a game evolve over time and see everything from the very beggining download it see it for yourself and make your own judgement its free anyway so there s a big bonus,pos

4883,the developer can do much morepros dayz kind of stylemany gunsmany skins100 player serverscon zombie be fast as hellwhen you join most people have gunspeople kill you on sightyou need to wait 50 second to exit when you dieyou have to wait for your character to reviveyou have to play 1hr to play on battle royaleoverral opinion this game can do much much more but i guess developer do not care about that and just want to re publish same game but with the different title,neg
4884,try to explore the map will result in forced return back to your base camp dev try to compensate for this small area of exploration with poor move mechanic move around be slow and annoying because the character be out of shape and breathe heavily every second of move at a walking speed there be only two speed slow and slow shooting mechanic be just ok final verdict 3 6 10,neg
4885,i never play mobas mostly because the community for 99 999 of mobas be pure toxicity but i can not get enough of this game it be a game that focus way more on skill rather than how much money be in your bank account the ship be all evenly balanced and i feel like i can compete against anyone it be one of the most balanced mobas i have ever play and i can not put this game down 9 10 for sure it be not perfect and the asteroid field in alpha do make me rage a bit but for the most part the game be very solid well polished and the community have yet to be toxic finger cross it will stay like that even though i highly doubt it would take to flavortown again,pos
4886,early access reviewone of the good digital card game out there they take the good thing about mtg and hs but add their own touch to create a easy to learn but hard to master card game,pos
4887,fun hack and slash with a lot of variety it can scratch that itch to run and jump around and smash thing just do not get too invest in it or you will get frustrate by how much you can buy your way to victory with your credit card but it be very much enjoyable without all that especially if you only play with friend so that you do not have to compare yourself with people who have drop a bunch of,pos
4888,early access reviewanother chance at it and i be still not happy with game play and the random disconnection match seem the same from where i leave off and still no bonus for be a vet player and we should have get our chest or the free memebership for pay still be not fair and i just can not make this game a habit untill i get comp or reimbure for past payment and game time it will be a wasted experience as i use to enjoy it when it start with teir system,neg
4889,this be the only game i have a bad internet connection on even on dota 2 i have a well internet connection than this furthermore your if your opponent pay to win your opponent can trigger off 5 effect in one turn all because you play 1 card or because your opponent just go first i be sick and tired of people summon blue eye white dragon turn 2 3 and 4 turn 5 whatever i should lucky no one can summon blue eye white dragon on turn 1 yet and attack this game have so much power creep it be go to need to constantly come out with more broken card blue eye white dragon net decker be the least of my worry i have far big fish to fry with the other deck the rose dragon deck how the game in many way discourage you from come up with creative and different deck type but rather heavily push you into an arch type build now bare in mind i have be win most of the time but win and lose be not the issue i have as well lose a bunch of match when i do not figure out how to trigger the tuner type ability for the monster it be not fun when my opponent play off 5 effect and i be just sit on my hand or have enough time to make a sandwhich and casually stroll on back wait for my opponent to be do with their turn and i wish i be joke about that but i be not gem be insanely easy to get i would say and i be able to get more gem than the beginning but again that be because i be kind of be a jerk on the match if i be go against someone from mexico or some palce i figure that they would not have good internet i would stall my turn until their internet connection cut out long enough for me to get the win that because of this and how many player from mexico and russia i be get i be able to keep bump myself up the rank slowly and bump up my level faster and faster and faster i think it take me less than a couple hour to get to lv 10 with yugi as well for some reason a lo tof the player i face from player with bad itnernet connection that they often do not have good card or at least the one i have be face i do feel bad for them but by all mean that be not the main problem the main problem be how the pacing be ruin by certian deck i could just farm from a bunch of player with low internet connection and just net deck like everyone else because i literaly keep run into deck after net deck and that be not fun because i like to see creative and different tactic and strat sure i be use the same strat but that be because i do not have any good card the tactic i go with 1 if i can summon 2 monster at turn 1 1 1 synchro summon and get 2300 atk dragon mosnter out1 2 if the monster get destroy i would just bring it back with 1 of 2 spell card i had2 if i could not then i would keep up my power3 go for raw power4 dig through my opponent graveyard5 send something to the graveyard5 1 then dig through the graveyard6 set up combo on my trap and monster to work well off of each other now i do not then those tactic be bad at all if anything they be the good thing i could come up with for all the card i have get the reason why be because i do not want to arch type focus but the only way to win at this game be to arch type focus which suck by all mean could we stop this hyper focus on arch type how be it fun to be restrict like this what be the point of experiment if it be basically punish i understand that the game start it be arch type focus because we get to have money but i mean really it get silly at a certian point this be just go to get bad and bad at this rate,neg

4892,okay my take on this game after read several hundred neg review about this game i decide to give its shot f2p after all my story begin and end within 5 second then bambi kill after the hulk mode run out instead of respawne i be boot to the main menu where now i can no longer connect to any server after check online for a fix to the game destroy bug the only help i find be to create a new window user then log in with that game delete and in future ill listen to the masse this game do not bother waste your bandwidth its really not worth it,neg
4893,early access reviewthis game be bad than actual garbage a majority of the weapon do not do anything at all and you be well off run with a knife around the map the hit box be so ed that you walk over people there be 1 weapon worth buy in this whole game the asval if you buy anything else you be e disabled i would not recommend this game to anyone unless you be 12 and you be not brave enough to steal your mom credit card to buy counter strike the game be just a plain rip off of it one of the map be literally a section of a dust 2 and the dev be so e lazy they just say it and close b hall off and make a tdm map,neg
4894,early access reviewi will keep this review brief i grow up with adventurequest the nostalgia value be certainly here in abundance the way it have be revisione from a 2d microsoft paint esque visual to a full scale 3d mmorpg be actually my favorite part about the game there be a lot of good thing about this game despite its early access state open beta there be also a lot that could be improve and even a few thing that need to be scrap first as a mobile game it be actually awesome play pretty well on my nexus 6p battery drain be surprisingly low and there be flexible graphic setting could be improve combat and gameplay be fun on mobile not as much on pc the cross platform do have its convenience though story be pretty standard ae it do not blow your mind but the humor be entertain for some to most a lot of the character particularly the one who have have time over the year to be flesh out and build around the ae staff they be base on be relatable and good character overall do not get too far into aqworlds so i can not speak as to how well they write villain these day from what i have see in what the story offer currently it be not so bad one of the first character i actually pay attention to and like get kill immediately and be probably the only character that will happen to it 100 need a book of lore like what aqw have it be hard even for veteran player to keep up on whether or not thing be complete thing be pretty ambiguous and the main story be a bit disjointed once you finish a zone a book of lore would fix all of that and give the developer a guide for future content in relation to player progression and main story cohesion progression need a lot of work class have no depth beyond what ability you immediately get when switch to them for some it be enough but there be definitely room for more character choice and gameplay option here skill tree ability upgrade passive etc what i miss from other ae game that i do not get from this one be actually progress in your class and earn rank title and ability i do hope they add it even if people will gripe about more thing to grind on that note gear could use some work too for one a character profile or equipment page inventory management especially with equipment be messy it need a page that show each slot and any equipped cosmetic would be nice if that all do not take up inventory space too gear stat need more depth and relevance i would like personal player stat we can choose to upgrade like classic aq but equipment just provide basic attack armor crit haste evasion etc be just boring i get that they want people to just switch between class at their discretion it be a fine idea if implement well but this way be just too simple and take away from player choice and meaningful gear grind if that be a thing that go into my last major critique which be the ui on pc some of the element have weird scaling on mobile screen space be hard to manage in any game but this one could use some work the inventory be mostly a big mess and it would be nice if the chat window and health bar be locate somewhere else although i can understand how frustrating it must be if any developer read this i would suggest have some ui option available for people as every mobile device be different aq3ds kickstarter page nail the main point it be a game that have a lot of potential it be not even close to live up to it though that be not to say it be a bad game just that it have so much room to grow in a market completely oversaturate with copy paste asian mmorpg especially on mobile this could be the game that topple it all and i hope it be i would recommend personally if only because i have actually be really enjoy my time with it on my phone i be really excited to see what they add later on especially if they take the time to gather feedback and update class accord to it if you do not grow up with ae they be the type of developer to literally put themselves into their game i have meet their npc and actual character dozen of time in game be transparent about their plan and shortcoming and keep push out content they seem to be spread a bit thin with how many game they have it would be a tough call to pull the plug on old game but i understand they be focus heavily on aq3d anyway it be certainly far from a perfect game even a great game but it be a great time killer on mobile and be like any ae game very social some of the negative review i have see be not totally fair i would just check it out on your phone if it seem interesting to you and make up your own mind like i do if you grow up with aq definitely try it out i will recommend this even in its rough incomplete stage because while it be fun and succeed in some way it have a long way to go and every bit of feedback help ae and i know they factor it all in,pos

4896,early access reviewok i be fully aware about what have be say negatively about this game however this game be do what any great game have it be try to bring more people in and it give a more easy system for some area where even i be still learn and i have play this game for about 2 year on and off if you count the first year make three but this game whilst have flaw like have all those nice and sweet vehicle that you have to buy to get these vehicle however can be take down with be smart and use smart tactic the new tech tree system be a bit of odd one for them to implement however it do have its use so that it make the whole gameplay more faster i be grind through match to have enough tech point for material and whilst some may say that there be less amount of credit give out i have earn more throughout match then i have ever before overall this game be amazing with the amount of creativity that will satisfy the most outlandish new word i think d of idea and thinker this game have have its up and down but it be still a great game as long as you apply some knowledge to it as to counter one of these new vehicle that someone pay over 12 for i hope the developer can see what their community put out as to keep this game run overall,pos
4897,game have a great idea but you know what i have not have much of a chance to play the game why you may ask well its because i could never get in a game i would set for 10 15 minute with a other player in the que and never find a game,neg
4898,ever since the last halloween event the game be become less and less enjoyable the bad part be the meet your match update you can no longer just join steam friend unless ask them and wait for them to finish game match last like 5 10 minute and your team either get destroy or you be destroy the other team very rarely there be a balanced match whoever enjoy competitive gameplay will enjoy this but whoever just want to spend like 30 minute of spare time it would not be such a good experience valve become too lazy to update anything or should i say the number of people work on anything relate to the game bug fix update decrease dramatically that definitely decrease the quality of the update they be even too lazy to modify the last major update we have on the store page which stay tough break now release almost a year ago event like scream fortress be really enjoyable in past year because valve always add something new for the past 2 year they rely only on the community to create a few map and that be everything new about the event for the time be i can not recommend this game to newcomer,neg
4899,early access reviewya know its a great game when you have a freind its even better when your team know how to play together but not in a mob make thing hard when your holding off the left flank alone so the enemy do not completely overun the base in 5 minute and yet i kill more then my share punch a few hole in some other guy and yet i be the one who seem to be place at the bottom of the leaderboard when i deal the most damage seriously make me angry that i get nada for exp when i stop an onslaught make me wonder how bad this will be in the long run,pos

4905,early access reviewthe s s i have to say for a 20 mb free download it be pretty good music combat and ui be understandably underwhelming but all the usual mmo function be there the game personality be where it come alive it be whimsical and humerus albeit cheesy at time and in an industry so over saturate with copy cat game it be refreshing to see developer showcase some artistic freedom and inspiration play with friend and escape the grind by find easter egg reference and goof around i play a female sport a guy fawkes mustache and meet 3 banker name edgar allan and poe it be a blast,pos
4906,i think the dev do some research on object that can scare human you may not like the style of the graphic but this game be the creepy horror game i have ever play all of the sound effect can scare you especially the cardboard in different level different monster will chase you which make the game more and more creepy therefore ignore the style of graphic and download the game i be sure you will not regret try it although you may regret try it because it be very scary game for all horror lover download it now tip if you be too scared turn off speaker and play,pos

4921,early access reviewi be very skeptical about this game when my friend be try to convince me to play as i be not a fan of battle royale style game normally i be quick to change my mind when i actually get into it with a group of friend and we be run a 4 man fireteam the map be large but there be many way to traverse it assume you take the time to plan to make the most of your form of transportation gunplay be intense as the game account for velocity and bullet drop with smgs and shotgun feel lethal in close combat while the dedicated sniper rifle if you can find a scope for them actually give you the ability to get kilometer standoff distance assume visibility be good the assault rifle cover the middle ground with some tend more to feel like smgs like the groza and m4 while other tend to be well at long range like the lvoa and akm the vehicle physics be absolutely legendary you can drive truck up 80 slope at 60kph and give the ridiculous terrain feature this be a huge plus and lead to some hilarious moment as well the graphic be good nothing exceptional but when you reach a mountain peak or be ride in the ski lift scatter around the map you be blow away by the fantastically design landscape the game be surprisingly optimize as well i be play on a laptop with a gtx1060 m and a 4th gen i7 and i be usually around 120 fp on the high setting even in intense firefight or the snowstorm that occur as a battle royale i give this game a 9 10 it be a simple game you grab gun you get attachment you follow the zone you kill the enemy team it do not do anything groundbreaking while at the same time have enough small change to the formula to make it stand out and actually be worth play with your buddy as a whole game experience 7 10 they supposedly have a pve mode come sometime next year as well and the pvp have give me enough of a reason to stick around to see where this go,pos
4922,originally i would have write a positive review about this game i enjoy play this game with friend and in group but after a while this game just get extremely repetetive and boring and if you do not pay you will have to sit hour and hour xp farm just to progress in rank the microtransaction have ridiculously high price aswell and the developer be extremely greedy this be one of the bad pay to win game i have ever play and i would advise you to stay far away from this game you should rather give verdun or red orchestra a try they may not be as good as in tankmen airplane paratrooper etc but atleast they be not pay to win it be a huge mistake for me to return to pay to win game never again 1 10 terrible game,neg

4935,early access reviewgaijin spyware malware agent and launcher should be block by default by any av software also make sure tol remove agent from your pc because that s t will stay on your pc in localappdata gaijin same apply for game it will most likely stay in your steam library where you instal it edit for dev who respond the only way to disable it would be with antivirus blocking start up why gaijin need 2 application 3 if we count in steam for a simple update i have no idea but agent run in background like a malware since task manager be the only place where you can see it run after close it and delete the game be fishy just because you can deactivate and close it do not mean it be not run sorry but that be not acceptable,neg
4936,dcs world one of the good game i have play in a long time dcs simulate combat in a great way and offer a wide variety of thing to do though at the start you be lock with air to ground until you buy dlc you recive two start aircraft for free the tf p51 no armament and the su 25 t arm thankfully the 25 t although have a steep learning curve be still very easy to operate as certain dlc aircraft require week of practice to be able to fly and use effectivley steep learning curve and all i would highly reccomend this game as it maintain realism allow you to fly more modern arcraft which be not something super popular with multiplayer capable air combat game and be enjoyable no matter wat you be do,pos

4942,  i be take all those log they keep throw out and i be nail them together this game be quite possibly one of the most intense game i have play since cry of fear it keep on one edge while still be a rather simplistic concept get to the end if there even be an end its something that rely heavily on atmosphere and the psudo randomly generate map and variety of hazard and i feel with the additon of endless mode and extra room it will be well worth the time and extra chump change for this soon to be legend,pos

4945,early access review what a great game and its free too so do not complain about something that s free the graphic be much well than i expect and game play while small be intense and reasonably fun but that net code ohhh my god even play way out of region due to there be no oceania server developer need to add one the game netcode be awesome if only large franchise like ea and ubisoft could learn how to pay proper attention to this while it be still in early development i can see this be a long lasting game as long as they keep player number per match small,pos
4946,early access reviewhaving play both the original and adventure quest world i can say that the developer at artix be off to a great start here you really have to appreciate that they can stick to their own style for as long as they have obviously at this point in development they have a lot of content to go before it can rival the previous game but i look forward to many year with aq3d,pos
4947,04 05 2015short summary play russian or get rekt and you will get banhammere 100 if you say anything negative not even slander just some negative comment be enough on their forum or website typical russian attitude long summary could have be a good game but russian tank and plane be totally op who would have guess dev be russians do not bother start as any other faction than russian for russians the game surely be fun smack everyone and everything should they ever change that and balance the russian faction to be in line with the other i will change this review lol but i guess hell freeze over before that day edit on a second thought i guess this review will stay negative forever since some funny mod delete a thread of mine where i point out the massive ongoing bias during the current ww2 chronicels event background german facion be outnumber on every single match and have bad tier tank aswell which climax yesterday in a 8v12 sb and 10vs13 rb that s just super dumb it start on 10vs12 and be already hard but their beloved russians still lose some game so they change it to 8vs12 which completely crush german faction historical you say i would too but they do the same on ever single day of the event even during the poland invasion poland picture as soviets outnumber the germans 15v10 and it be unwinnable loloh and do i mention censor every issue whitch reflect their bad work on update or stuff where they create more imbalance than before on their forum and in the steam group be be almost immediately delete or lock and put in archive without any reason give if they would just communicate with the playerbase once they could have really easy solution for long lasting problem but they prefer not to get involve and banhammer everything instead just russian style day by day the same shit 16 07 2016tried an event t54 vs centurionin short british 3x 6 7 tank vs russian 7 3 7 7 8 0you may imagine the match be full off russian tank and nowhere a brit tank to be see but no russian bias right this be so big time bs have several faction unlock i can now draw direct conclusion the deeper you get into this game the more and more biased it get some really biased and game ruin hard fact fire on russian plane extinguish like 95 of the time it burn a while keep fly and then viola fire be out magically russian magik fire extinguisher all other nation just burn down 95 of the time hit russian tank into ammo rack or fuel often nothing happen nothing hit other nation on same place instakill kill the commander on a german tank even if gunner still live the tank will not be able to shoot at you anymore kill a russian commander nothing tank can fire normally kill german gunner while reload gunner be replace and reloading start from anew kill russian gunner during reload reloading continue from the point where it be before the gunner die russian it1 missile have an obvious bug and can fly trough solid building and wall wich you can not penetrate with tank shell or any other missile carrier it be be report month ago still no fix and i do not think it ever will be gunner on bomber lol british german and jap gunner on full level be fairly useless they hardly hit plane chase you on 300 m russian gunner be of course all pro sniper hit plane on 1 km and take them down rather easily not sure how many kill i make on russian bomber but it be an ridiculous amount i would be really curious to see stat about that us bomber be soso due to immense turret number they may hit sometimes too and take chsing plane down but just sometimes general game mechanic problem the well you play currently 87 avg position here the more you get uptiered in solo queue without my not so good clan member i get uptiered into 1 br like 9 10 match so you end up play the whole match as aaa since your tank be mostly useless in 1 game,neg

4949,this be a great arena style game the visual be awesome and the gameplay be even well there be enough ability on the different ship to all make the unique but no so many that a player feel overwhelmed with option such as in league of legend this be my opinion i could never get into lol due to this other opinon may very the gamepley be well paced and the progression of level whilst in game not out of game rank be steady enough so that the game be not instantly over but also not so long that the game drag out for age the release of the new story mission that come out with every new patch be a bit of a double edge sword the new game mode be fantastic and bring a new way to play the game into the game however i think that because so many people be play this game mode because it be very good there be not many people wait to play regular pvp with me wait up to 45 minute before be able to paly a game on the whole i really like this game and would deffinitely recomend this to anyone who like the idea of the whole arena combat style of game but be intimidate by game such as lol or dota 2 furthermore it also suit the casual gamer be simle enough for people to be able to pick the game up and just play whilst also be complex enough for competative gamer to be able to have fun too,pos

4955,early access reviewi play this game quite a while back for a bit believe it to be decent but lack i have to say the game have come quite some way but it be still in need of more quality of life improvement the good good preformance run 3770k and 980 not grindy no step up of this ship be well they be simply different gameplay flow be good slow enough to be tactical and fast enough to be fun ship truly be different and forfil different role within the game and just just this be a healbot ship and this one do damage they all have their prefered way of playing so once you be in you will find the ship that suit your playstyle the bad pricing feel high on the micro transaction they be boarderline macro in my opinion and this be not a problem unique to this game lack a quick communicate option like a command tree where you can with 2 3 button press ask for support order an attack etc etc etc such a system would be helpful in public match and specially give new player and idea of what to do bit more feedback on what just nuke you would be nice sometimes you can really go from be just fine to death in second a bit of a what happen would be ideaal to help you learn again quality of life the ugly match making be unsure of itself it feel 1 match be very quick and the next one just will not show up this make it quite annoying to play because there be also no indication of why thing take longer so if there be very few player communicate this that way it be still bad but not frustrating overal i would recommend this game to those who like big space ship and moba style game as that be what it be a moba with capital space ship,pos

4957,meet your match be a mess of an update but i believe that tf2 will pull through like time and time before again many balance have be for the well and for the not as well think out one underlie them lie a recognition of the true problem which a great step forward to all the minor class and weapon rebalance i appreciate spy and pyro buff valve recognize that pyro and spy be underpowere a health buff for pyro 185 instead of or in addition to its dps buff would be better suit to its current role in tf2 i believe however natascha and huo long be nerfe and buff nicely sun on a stick may actually see some use now maybe other good rebalance include widowmaker short circuit disciplinary action eureka effect overdose as a medic main i get and like what valve be try to do here the point i be try to make be that from all the rebalance one can see that valve really be take the time to understand how this game be play with that in mind here be some of the major problem i see and how valve can fix them casual it be a good idea the only problem be it be no longer casual you can not join friend in the middle of a game anymore and the server they assign you to have terrible ping where i be all the good player who like to mess around stop play and all the terrible player start tryharde an easy way to fix this be bring back the option to let you join casual in the middle of the game by look through server list or the join game button and voting system to extend current map match up comp should be available for all player who have play above a certain amount of hour instead of just for those who pay for the game if one or two hour farmer get through it will not matter because valve could easily use their rank system to pair people with similar skill level together if you be not good do not matter how much you game the system you be stick at bottom comp need class limit maybe 2 for each assault class and one for each defense class and they could explain it as to keep the game dynamic read up on the metagame and watch some match before you ask why medic speed buff be stupid increase survivability of medic encourage stalemate in comp medic feel safe less urgency to push from win team reduce the fun in play medic because you get to be sloppy in your positioning less good at dodging which be basically all medic be about scout do not need another buff or whatever this be to scout it sound like it make sense travel at the same rate of the player you be heal but it be actually really gimmicky basically boil down to heal scout to go fast because they be only class faster than medic despite the above potential player do not be put off tf2 be still a miracle of a game the chemistry between all the class work so well it be incredibly fun to play and get good be really satisfying besides there be always community server to tide this over cp orange jump map mge 24 7 dustbowl hightower,pos
4958,planetside 2 be a beast of a game boast large multiplayer battle with fly machine tank large armored fly carrier motorbike and other sort of motorize madness the server hold three faction the vanus teran republic and the new conglomerate each faction have thier own vechile and weapon with slight twist on all of them there be at least 6 or 7 class from heavy class to sniper and medic to mech suit each class also have its own ability for example light assult have a jetpack and the sniper class or infiltrator or whatever its call can cloak the three faction strive for dominance on one of four continet a snowy one esamir a swamp hossin a desert indar and a temperate one amerish each continent hold at least 2 000 player i think at least from what i have read which mean fight can get a bit crazy most of the time the continent be evenly divide into three equal part unless it be on indar because there everyone fight for that one territory by the name of the crown where every faction be really test each class start out with stock weapon which be pretty decent and most of which can be upgrade to have a scope a silencer to fire faster etc other gun can be buy from the store which cost quite a bit of in game currency or premeium currency now at this point you should know that if you want to upgrade your weapon and ability it cost quite a bit of ingame currency for example the 1st upgrade for light assult jetpack maye be 50 pt the the 2nd upgrade may be 150 pts the the 3rd upgrade may be 300 pt so on and so forth no those be not the actual price i be just toss number around the cost be way cheap in game i be just use those number as an example it can becaome quite a bit of a grind at some point but its not that bad in game currency be achieve from do thing i guess i do not know where i get the in game currency from your vechile abiltie can also be upgrade such as the shielding the plane or tank gun etc which also cost quite a bit of in game currency or some premium currency now some people say to get the most out of the game you have to join this game equivalent of a guild this be because you can have a leader of some sort give your guild an objective and you and your guild head over to capture some facility as a single group all prepare fly in large group of fly people carrier call galaxy that way it be easy to get thing do and that way you do not wander around just hope from battle to battle this may or may not be true i do not join one but i do not really care all that much about teamwork or play with friend or whatever the game at launch be notorious for be poorly optomize i do not know about now though because i get a new computer i hover around 50 frame on ultra so that be nice um 8 10 nice large scale fight diverse way to fight nice graphic if you can run it need to party up to have fun a bit grindy,pos

4965,pretty fun at first then you realize its hard to get point so you replay gun over and over to learn them and buy other gun to take apart and put them back together to get point to buy more gun to do that to it be not really a game more of a learning program that teach you how to build different gun and other pack include skeleton and motorcycle it be frustrating boring after 2 hour and not really worth your time it be a unique and somewhat interesting game that i would play a few time a year though,neg

4982,early access reviewwith my little time play i have experience everything i need to write a solid review it be good it be not go to blow you away by any mean and it be not go to make you want to throw your computer out the window it be in the sweet spot of good and bad it be what you would expect from a f2p first person shooter what you would not expect be a non pay to win aspect to the game gain ingame currency be not that diffcult and will most likely bring player back who want to visit the shop more often you be not pay anything for it so why not try it it be the generic arcade style shooter run in gun be pretty extensive in this game and i recommend you hop in with some friend and have some fun with that be say do not take this game too seriously you be probably go to die a lot as i do and rage would just make it not fun just run and gun and have some fun overall though it be a pretty solid for what your pay nothing,pos
4983,interesting game its easy to play easy to learn if you read the manual and the update unfortunately its riddled with bug and everytime they fix one bug two more seem to show up that s not the bad part of the game though the bad part be the player environment player will target other player include on their own team they will harass and bully player they believe be cause them to lose the game thereby diminish their mmr mmr be the developer way of rating each player skill at the game which in itself be completely uncontrollable by player since you be randomly assign team member some with skill some without the mmr be the source and cause of the harassment and bullying in the game which be responsible for cause a hostile playing environment i would not recomend this game if you just want to have fun its take to seriously by some player as if it have some real life application its just a game and a fun game but be entirely ruin by an unneccesary rating system that inherently create a hostile environment,neg
4984,solo arena be really unbalanced some game be guarantee loss if they get to start with a creature and it be purple or well you lose if they have a weenie deck and one of the lane convert to animal you lose if the final boss have a 1 dmg a turn starter and you do not have the mana ring you lose very frustrating to draft a good deck and lose,neg
4985,i have only play this game for a few day but it be very well do and well worth try there be some micro transaction but that seam to be the way that these card game be go great story line so far though,pos
4986,raceroom dlc dlc that only include car dlc that only include some car and some track dlc that only include a certain championship with its car track and season feature this be the dlc only visible in steam then there be dlc only visible in the game and its own store the store make special offer that save you money in the store you can also pay for each car and each track this price policy be my reason to not recommend raceroom i can not put a customize raceroom game together that fit my need and be worth the money at the end of the day this be a terrible business model remember ten year ago you could buy for less money a full racing game with more content than this cash grab and its whole dlc content,neg
4987,i see one of those cardboard cutout jumpscares but it be a skull with decay muscle and have a scream noise which immediately make me stop play 10 10 this game scare the absolute outta me and i can not even last 2 hour in one sit if you be look for a scary game that will make youandyourself then look no further i will probably add more to this review if i grow a pair of ball and play this game again whch i w evetuay,pos

4990,after read through the negetave review i can see that none of them should be there i e love this game its get simple combat and simple gameplay but its for some reason amazing everyone who have this a negative review be complain about the que time but they do not understand that the dev have no idea that the game would be so popular on launch some people do not understand launch be when there will be the most bug and the most problem,pos
4991,this game be horrid i do not even need to list the reason why it be so bad to name one off the top of my head the spawn be pre set and when you spawn you will likely meet your death to somebody camp on a hill nearby your spawn location,neg

4997,i spend alot of time on this game i enjoy it alot make many friend form it the game itself be really great and have a fantastic community it be just a casual loose and fun shooter that i screw around in for many hour with or without friend but ever since this new update where they remove the quickplay function this can no longer be do everything have a serious competitive feel to it heck you even get penalise for leave a match i think this be outragous to have such a sudden and drastic change to this game i be never into the competitive scene otherwise i may aswell just play csgo please bring the properly casual quickplay feature back many people would agree with me that pub be an essential part of tf2 please valve do not ruin tf2,neg

4999,satisfy combat fun progression best in industry business model can not really ask for more in an mmorpg soe know their stuff no one give you this level of content without a pay wall 40 for the top tier expansion virtually everything else be available for free and be not behind some insane grind that premium member can skip they be move more towards a guild war model with every patch and it work,pos
5000,this game despite be a mmo type free to play with microtransaction blow me away the graphic be stun the physic be very realistic the plane be beautiful and the combat envrionment be well balanced bravo to ganjin here this be a truly beautifull game in my opinion the good part be that it if one wish not to participate in the microtransaction it be possible to obtain just about all of the game content and actually compete by simply play long enough which be well than many other free to play out there keep in mind that this game be still in development and balancing be constantly be rework it be one of the good combat flight simulator game i have play with the plan addition of playable ground and naval unit it promise to be one of the good ww2 combat game out there hey what have you get to loose anyway it be free go try it out it be get a 5 5 from me,pos
5001,10 10every 3 4 month a new update be release with a new league new mechanic some rework always add more late game content a lot to do in theorycraft term and a lot of way to have fun of course it have its meta but you do not need to follow it in order to have fun and make profit no p2w mtx more like pay to storage but you get 4 stash tab at the beginning and you can get some stash whenever they put em in sale pretty often tbh you can both play it as softcore or hardcore player not talk about game mode but time spend on game i have play as many hour as you see and still not close to be tired,pos
5002,early access reviewthis game be pretty small as of rn not much to buy in game however i see it have great potential ad become something much big and grand i hope the dev dev can work on this and also put in somesort of team voice chat i would really appretiate that honestly fantastic game play with more to come graphic be pretty good and optimization be fantastic great game for a great price shoutout to mighty jingle youtuber for introduce me to this game,pos
5003,early access reviewawesome game for an early access and free to play unfortunately they be some guy or kid who be ruin the spirit of that game by succeed to cheat despite the anti cheat obviously they do not understand this game too bad for them still a great game specially if you have friend to play with impatient to see the final result,pos
5004,early access reviewone of my favorite game on steam extremely fun to turn on whenever there be friend over couch party be awesome and there be not much more i could ask from this game,pos
5005,although gameplay be alright at best this game be poorly optimize for absolutely no reason at all it on your cpu and do not even bother to use your gpu at all cause frame drop even when your gpu be x10 million time well than the recommend and or minimum so if you be fine with play at 20fps then sure go for it but it be not worth to be completey honest,neg
5006,dis game be rig and pay2win its fun yes but its so riggedfree monoply except less charming you can not trade with player the board be small and there be pay2win in the form of buy particular roll of the dice hard pass game be setthere be pay to win in the game you can pay for extra dice roll and if that be not bad enough it do not even tell you if your opponent use these reroll it just look like regular roll on your screen so you have no idea if the person be cheat or not,neg
5007,glitchy fight close quarter mean you can not point anywhere near a wall plane be break tank be break and you can only have any fun if you pay to win who win a fight depend about 70 weapon ptw 12 weapon to situation 10 previous life knowledge and 8 skill adjust previous life knowledge to spawn camping which be about 20 of battle,neg
5008,fight other capital ship in a sector pvp lot of fun and amazing graphic while the game do have microtransaction and can feel like a grind to buy new ship it be definitely worth a try for anyone interested in the game or like sci fi games happy fly,pos

5010,  editthe last time i touch this garbage be september of last year and honestly it have change for well and for bad but mostly for bad there be some balance and some new stuff add mostly pay thing mind you and i can safely say that this be the last time i be touch this game ever for starter it feel much more tilted towards pay player rather than regular player to a very annoying degree i would not even put it past bethesda direwolf to have program this be possible do not even try to deny it some feature of match up non pay player with pay player in rank or otherwise to entice them to pay up for well card to win with i abstain from ever buy anything on this game with real money and i be estatic that i do because it be not worth it and i do not condone the behaviour bethesda and possibly direwolf have be sport in this game and in bethesdas case in general all in all this game really be not anything special and be not too great unless you be willing to fork over a few dollar to be able to stand a fighting chance against many of the well deck people will have make from buy deck or will have buy lastly there s one thing that seem to need a change yet refuse to change the accessability of build a guard base deck guard card be nice and all but when you be go up against someone who be deck be primarily guard and buff action card then you start to feel like you be smack your head against a brick wall hope to demolish it i do not have the time or patience or even money to git gud at a game that prioritzes player money over their skill or competence this game have the potential to be fun it really do sadly it be not quite at such a potential yet the rank leave much to be desire the other main feature be just pay 2 play up the and most of the time in rank you will end up with someone 2 or 3 rank above you who have spend 18 buck on the good card for their pack that will decimate you its sad really because i kinda enjoy this game but trust me rank can be a struggle and it be the only mode that s technically free and actually give reward like septims and card with a rare chance of a pack the steam trading card require you to spend real money something that should be outright ban on steam as it be but i see they do not quite give enough s to care regardless if any dev be read this ha i highly doubt that you have a great potential to make this well than hearthstone do not up just listen to some of the fan improve what need improve i do think that its nice that i can buy certain full deck with septims as oppose to money that s a very very good thing consider too many game force you to use real money on anything and everything in game nowadays but i digress rank can be fix a bit and maybe balance the card a bit make many deck less overpowered and make it more worthwhile to make a custom deck use card exclusive to buy deck update so when you get to a milestone in rank they make a midway point for you once you hit say milestone if you lose a battle you go down a rank lead into this really stupid midrank that you can very easily get stick in if you erratically win and lose i feel like this be lazy and honestly could be fix too update 2 okay i learn that custom deck be really absurdly broken so if you be to make what i call a swat team deck where you use mainly guard card and item card that boost attack and defense you have a 85 chance to basically ruin anyone you come across there s actually several card that really need to be debuffe and actually have turn me off of this game i will list a few golden saint if you know this card you can see how it can be a match ruiner ring of imaginary may couple this with any guard with regenerate and a defense up or two and your opponent be screw and royal guard be also a really powerful card regardless many of the most powerful card require you to fork over 12 18 buck of your or your mother if you be a young child who pester their parent for money like a leech suck blood money thus make the game have the illusion of be fair until you get into the meat or lack there of and find a pay 2 win game with many feature lock behind paywall so would i recommend this game no not even a little bit hell even hearthstone be well than this,neg
5011,do not it be a hi rez game no matter how much you may be enjoy it at the time their greed will inevitably become apparent in the end they will only break your heart because they really just want your money,neg
5012,if you want to drive a car around a track then this game be for you if you however want a multiplayer racing game with good physics good interface and overall a good experience that be worth the space it take in storage do not get this game recommend for people who have enough money to spend on virtual car in a free to play game instead of an actual game that be worth how much you pay for it,neg
5013,early access reviewgreat game feel pretty polished for a game in alpha but it doent have a solo mode so if no one be on your out od luck and you have to try and 1v2 people still a great game tho,pos
5014,it be not the great looking game but man it run perfect on my somewhat dual core i5 8 gb ram and gt 970 at max setting low end computer take awhile to get use to feel as there be no actual race line as in gt or fm and it will take lot of money to get all car and track right below 9 buck for the 3 variant of nordsheilf or however u spell it u know the one this game will definitely be an investment which be scary as it be online only even for single player stuff so if server shut down say goodbye to all the stuff u pay for i like it and will continue to play,pos
5015,this be a fun low maintenance game that do a good job of use the fallout world give you mission to collect loot and make good use of the special stat system main criticism be the ui which be port from touch screen and it can cause some annoyance when try to select a particular character as you can easily miss also it be too easy to inadvertently pick someone hide behind a wall when you move the screen around i have not spend a penny of real money on this and i be up to something like 140 dweller each time i log in i usually have a new dweller wait to join my vault in fact i have so many of the little guy in there it be get hard to juggle them around properly some tip training dweller by assign them to training room where a particular stat be improve be essential to get the vault work efficiently after they have improve a stat assign them to the correspond work room so they can level up have high level character and arm them all be the good way to give your character a good chance of survive vault attack and have success on mission the only reason to spend money be if you be really impatient but it would be poor value so i do not recommend do that,pos

5028,early access reviewthe fact that so many book still name the beatles as the great or most significant or most influential rock band ever only tell you how far rock music still be from become a serious art jazz critic have long recognize that the great jazz musician of all time be duke ellington and john coltrane who be not the most famous or rich or good seller of their time let alone of all time classical critic rank the highly controversial beethoven over classical musician who be highly popular in court around europe rock critic be still blind by commercial success the beatles sell more than anyone else not true by the way therefore they must have be the great jazz critic grow up listen to a lot of jazz music of the past classical critic grow up listen to a lot of classical music of the past rock critic be often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past they barely know the good seller no wonder they will think that the beatles do anything worthy of be save in a sense the beatles be emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole too much attention pay to commercial phenomenon be it grunge or u2 and too little to the merit of real musician if somebody compose the most divine music but no major label pick him up and sell him around the world a lot of rock critic will ignore him if a major label pick up a musician who be as stereotyped as can be but launch her or him worldwide your average critic will waste river of ink on her or him this be the sad status of rock criticism rock critic be basically publicist work for major label distributor and record store they simply highlight what product the music business want to make money from hopefully one not too distant day there will be a clear demarcation between a great musician like tim buckley who never sell much and commercial product like the beatles at such a time rock critic will study their rock history and understand which artist accomplish which musical feat and which simply exploit it commercially beatles aryan music remove any trace of black music from rock and roll it replace syncopated african rhythm with linear western melody and lusty negro attitude with cute white kid smile contemporary musician never speak highly of the beatles and for good reason they could never figure out why the beatles song should be regard more highly than their own they know that the beatles be simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon thank to beatlemania which have nothing to do with their musical merit that phenomenon keep alive interest in their mediocre musical endeavour to this day nothing else grant the beatles more attention than say the kink or the rolling stone there be nothing intrinsically well in the beatles music ray davies of the kink be certainly a far well songwriter than lennon mccartney the stone be certainly much more skilled musician than the fab four and pete townshend be a far more accomplished composer capable of entire opera such as tommy and quadrophenia not to mention the far great british musician who follow them in subsequent decade or the us musician themselves who initially spearhead what the beatles merely later repackage to the masse the beatles sell a lot of record not because they be the great musician but simply because their music be easy to sell to the masse it have no difficult content it have no technical innovation it have no creative depth they write a bunch of catchy 3 minute ditty and they be photogenic if somebody have not invent beatlemania in 1963 you would not have waste five minute of your time read these page about such a trivial band extend note from 2010 the beatles be not a terribly interesting band but their fan be and still be an interesting phenomenon i can only name religious fundamentalist as annoying and as threaten as beatles fan and as persevere in sabotage anyone who dare express an alternate opinion of their faith they have turn me into some kind of internet celebrity not because of the 6 000 bio that i have write not because of the 800 page book that i publish not because of the 30 year of cultural event that i organize but simply because i downplay the artistic merit of the beatles an action that they consider as disgraceful as the 2001 terrorist attack jakub krawczynski send me this supportive comment in 2010 i find it quite amusing that almost all of the beatles song have their own entry on wikipedia nothing wrong with that in itself actually even if they be not single and each of them be meticulously dissect as if there be transcendental suite exceed human comprehension yet band like faust or red krayola etc have biography even short than just one article about any random beatle song needless to say none of their song have any article on them yet i be sure there would be a lot more to talk about moreover if you have put any bad review of their album on the site with the intention to show the broad scope of opinion you would risk your life there since such fanatic do not accept any single sign of try to be objective you be see as public enemy number 1 to them it be like your article be one giant cognitive dissonance to them and vandalize your bio be the only way to reduce this dissonance italian text translate by ornella c grannis and proof edit by daniel vogel the beatles most certainly belong to the history of the 60 but

roll could finally be include in the pop chart the beatles represent the quintessential reaction to a musical revolution in the making and for a few year they manage to run its enthusiasm into the ground furthermore the beatles represent the reaction against a social and political revolution they arrive at the time of the student protest of bob dylan of the hippie and they replace the image of angry kid fist in the air with their cordial face and amiable declaration they come to replace the accusatory word of militant musician with overindulgent nursery rhyme thus the beatles serve as middle class tranquilizer as if to prove the new generation be not make up exclusively of rebel misfit and sex maniac for most of their career the beatles be four mediocre musician who sing melodic three minute tune at a time when rock music be try to push itself beyond that format one originally confine by the technical limitation of the 78 rpm record they be the quintessence of mainstream assimilate the innovation propose by rock music within the format of the melodic song the beatles belong like the beach boy whom they emulate throughout most of their career to the era of the vocal

5041,i think the good way to review a game like this be to break it down in order to highlight everything properly art design dude 10 10 waifu you get a huge array of waifu to punch from the normal cat fairy and dragon girl to the more out there mud plant and yuki onna girl and with each type of girl have a few different design asset there be a surprising range of design for the hoard of waifu you will be click through and if you be sad enough you may even recognize a couple of asset background and girl from other sakura games and there be lot of diversity you can also customize your player character and if you shell out you different little outfit for her which depend on the type of person you be may interest you sound i recommend play this game 100 volume with no headphone to maximize the experience the constant animu moaning that come from this game be a wacky and fun thing to hear and sometimes you get to hear nya which be well horrible but the ironic charm be fantastic this be all family friendly fun you see gameplay it be your standard clicker game where you click the waifus to add them to your harem yes you punch monster girl to add them to your harem it be e fantastic and get currency to purchase automatic clicker and upgrade for them to make your click do more damage make the automate attack strong have little power up it be nothing out of the ordinary but why fix what be not break the clicker model have be prove and this do not look to screw it up the real differentiator come from difficulty curve yo this game get pretty difficult in the end game this clicker separate the man who wanna look at anime t ttie from the man who wanna play a decent clicker game and also look at anime t ttie you will have to learn to utilize the reset mechanic as well how to distribute point in order to maximize profit and progress as far as you can or else you will plateu in progression you will have to take what you learn from previous run in order to get well overall this game be a masterpiece clicker game be try and true fun time and this game be no exception but pair this with the dynamic diverse waifu punch the fantastic sound design and actual strategy involve it take the game from an ironic 7 10 meme to a fun 10 10 time waster clicker game also the fact that you can turn it off and still get cash help level progression and will save you from rack up too many hour actually in game spare you from the embarrasment of your family friend and colleague tl dr dem gud anime t ttie,pos

5065,i honestly do not even know how or where to start with this game it have no form of tutorial guide basic series of single player practice session to show you what you get with the game what you have game mode anything it be basically just a very very old school pick a series pick a car hit race that be pretty much it i find it quite surprising that it have so many user with such a bad interface and menu structure as a user you honestly do not know where to start after some trial and error i eventually discover that most car need to be buy you only get actually i do not know what you get because it do not list anywhere how many or which car you do get it be just such a bad user experience even acr with all its problem and browser client mishmash be far supperior the first time i start it i basically just get the background cinematic and no menu after google around i find that you have to set a start parameter for the steam version why be not this set as standard do not i just install the game through steam so after you eventualy get it to work you have to wonder if you actually have any sound because there be no effect what so ever in the menu no clicking efect no music no nothing i play around with my volume until i enter a race and it be too loud and finaly we come to the actual driving experience well if you use a controller or keyboard you be basically hose the car be mostly unconstrollable unless you have a wheel and even then i be not sure the default setting be ok after much fiddling around with sensitivity adaptive steering speed and other setting i manage to get a relatively ok set it work fine for the car i be use at the time but as soon as i change car well i need to see what i could do again the menu interface thing be quite buggy and unintuitive you have a back button to go back to the game and if you hit back inside the game as in to go back to the main menu it take you back into the matchmaking menu so basically and infinite loop of back button now on to the plus point after try out multiple car i do have to admit you could feel when one car be heavy or light or have soft suspension and that be a very very good thing it become pretty obvious that underneath the bad interface it be run a very good simulation engine on the polish oldtimer you can feel the heavy engine at the back try to oversteer the car on different dtm car of the same era class you can feel the different personlity of each car i really like that for example you can tell the audi v8 be very heavy compare to the merc 190 or the m3 you can feel that the mustang have much soft suspension but be stil quite light the fwd car do understear in slow corner and they do lift off oversteer just like they should dip in the road do make your car unstable and sometimes create wheelspin this also sais a lot about the quality and detail of the track this be especially noticeable on some long high speed corner the vibrator on the side of the track do unsettle your car and can make it jump up in the air so yes the racing engine underheath be very very good the graphic do look good for a racing game there be not much to say about them everything run smoothly no stutter high fps the amount of detail give to the sound during racing be quite high it have suspension and pannel squeke i be quite dissapointed to be honest i really like all their previous game and those do have much well interface and functionality this be just slopy in so many way from what i have play so far i be tempt to try it some more just because that surprisingly good engine underneath that crap interface i have not yet find out how exacly you enter a multiplayer race there be some challenge and some server but instruction be scarce at good i do not even think there be any form of experience or leveling but if there be i be not able to find it,neg

5067,early access reviewthe gameplay be not very good to begin with the matchmaking be completely unbalanced craft your robot be even ruin with the terrible rng crate system which be either put in place in an attempt to make the game bad or an attempt to squeeze more money out of its player base with what be essentially gamble on top of that be the premium membership which tie in with the crate system and the craft system to squeeze out even more money from its player base premium membership be not a one time buy it require a subscription like an mmo the subscription option range from a few day to six month after every match you get a crate with some item well type of crate have a high chance for rare item you get well crate from be high on the scoreboard and on the win team in a match you get more item per crate depend on the type of match you play match type that generally take longer give more item the item you get be completely random and if you be not a premium member you only get half of the item per crate so if you happen to get a good item in a lock off row and you be not premium it be go this be of course mean to encourage people to pay for premium but it be more likely to just drive player away from the game even with premium which i have for 3 day you mostly get garbage even after hour and hour of grind the same poorly balanced match type over and over again there be a way to get more crate without grind for hour though of course you can buy them with real life money so if you want to get a lot of item some of which would hopefully be good you can pay for a few day of membership then pay for several of the high tier crate then hope you get something you actually want on top of that most of the paint color be restrict to premium member only so if you want to paint your robot anything other than white dark gray light blue and orange then you have get to pay for premium of course you do not have to pay for anything you could go on just play the game but that lead to the bad part yet the game play the movement feel clunky and the combat be bad by that i mean weapon at least the one you start with have terrible accuracy especially at long range this can still be sort of enjoyable when you be up against robot with similarly weapon but like i say there be no balance in the matchmaking any weapon part go for any game mode they only match base on the robot cpu score each item have a cpu cost strong rare weapon have a slightly high cpu cost than weak basic weapon however if you build your robot with just the basic like a helicopter rotor attach to a powerful missile launcher the missile lock on by the way or a rail gun to a few block flat on some wheel tread whatever you can easily get match with new player use robot with much weak weapon which most likely can not even hit you reliably from the range you be hit them another common annoyance be people use small fast robot which hover or fly around you fire some sort of homing weapon which mean their robot can constantly be move quickly and erratically while always hit you because they do not have to worry about aim and even if you do land a lucky hit they will just heal fully if they do not get hit again within ten second while you probably will not be able to heal because they never miss with their homing weapon constantly chip away at you the only real way to counter this would be to build a similar robot assume you have the part even if you do though do that seem like fun a bunch of people just mindlessly fly around hold down the left mouse button until one team win not exactly great gameplay even if all of that sound good to you the only way to get well weapon and part be to keep play these poorly balanced match over and over again for hour till you hopefully get the part you want need or until you get enough garbage to recycle for anything from less than 1 to about 30 or 40 of what each of your item be worth destroy your item in the process of course then finally get enough in game currency from all that crap you spend all that time grind for to finally afford some of the ridiculously expensive item from the in game shop you can do all of that to see if maybe the game get a bit more enjoyable or you can just play a different game,neg

5088,team fortress 2 a great game transform over the year into a shape that i no longer recognise nor love have quit the game for around a year whilst still follow update what i say may seem harsh but i say it because tf2 may still have the potential to be a great game again in my opinion tf2 have be neglect lopsided balance and long exist bug leave unaddressed for year whilst in recent month they have attempt to address such problem they ultimately leave them too late visually the game have change a lot mainly due to horrendous look outlandish cosmetic item be add that do not even try to match the original art style not forget the various visual change that may be intentional or not that have also decrease the quality of how the game appear for example on old map lighting be screw up as be several decorative decal find on those map that be now invisible or barely visual in comparison to their release i do not want to list every issue like this as i understand they be likely this way due to either optimisation or update to the source engine over the year that have cause such part of the game to break the big nail in tf2s coffin for me be the removal of pub in favour of an overwatch esque matchmaking system completely change how the majority would play drop in and drop out be one of the major appeal for me and it be one of the define reason i quit this game the more casual atmosphere of pub be enjoyable and the option for mvm and even competitive tf2center etc not the terrible competitive they do add be there for those look for a more coordinated experience mvm be an enjoyable part of my playtime personally however as mention earlier the lopsided balance of tf2 be only amplify here whenever they do change weapon stat they completely forget to consider any effect they would have on mvm should valve decide to allocate more staff to tf2 perhaps one day it will return to a state where i can safely say i love this game again however with the small handful that do work on tf2 this be rather unlikely,neg
5089,product receive for freetl dr this game be absolutly worth download and atleast try its a blend of league of legends and battlestar galactica in one title and who would say no to that i originally get this game during the mighty jingle promotion stop play it for a while because of performance issue play again during the free weekend in jan 2016 and forget about it again start play after the may update and immediatly remember why i be so interesting in it even whilst dislike the majority of moba style game firstly the game look i be hesitant to say beautiful but it look good for a game in alpha the effect look like they actually come from the weapon you fire and not some b movie look stock flak effect now that the game be out this game be absolutly gorgeous i can not fault a single visual effect present within the game the ship be stunningly pretty with a varied design even within the 3 ship manufacturer asthetics second the combat it feel heavy its very much like battlestar galactic in that the ship do not float about like their make of nothing they all have inertia they take time to slow or turn especially with the large tanki ship like the leviathan gladiator or colossus when you fire your gun especially on destroyer they feel weighty they feel like they should for a capital class warship they have presence that so many game fail to achieve onto the monetization of the game there be premium time for more exp and credit cosmetic skin and premium skin that provide even more credit per gamethird the unnecessarily fear drop system its effect be minimal on the game drop range from credit to crew elite xp use to level up unlock crew and you can even earn premium currency and premium skin on to something i have notice in other review people complain about it be p2w which be completly untrue as there be no pay for only item in the game that have any effect on gameplaythe grindy nature of fractured space be not a new system its be present in plenty of other game without complaint fractured space need a monetisation system and the one they have implement be easily one of the most generous system i have ever see in a game like this overall you should at minmum try this game its free to play after all and if you enjoy it please play it edgecase game deserve far more player for a game that rival the large mobas in gameplay and feature,pos

5095,early access reviewstill very early alpha so the game be a bit rudimentary and buggy still but the concept be really entertain its very fun to play think about later stage of development i must say this be a game with a lot of potential if you love space battle and intense fighting give it a try its worth it only a few basic ship type available at the moment but all have very differeent role and give you very different possibility to play against the enemy ship you have cloak assassin disruptor ship that can heal your ally and disable the weapon of enemys there be sniper ship huge flagship etc highy recommend and fun game,pos

5112,besides the fact that the game launcher do not allow you to purchase a membership from within the launcher itself some or other error most people get go onto their website and you can buy membership em etc its a fun game to play with friend sure the single player hunt be rewarding but there be nothing well than run around with a trusted friend while you try play pin the 300 on the bear also and this nearly turn my review from a positive to a negative when the launcher tell you that you need to update in order to play never assume it will just be as easy as close game press play in steam watch update i have try a few thing none have work not sure if they be just slow to push their update to steam after tell the launcher not to let anyone play or if their launcher code be just not that well write who know if you want a free to play game that you will need to spend between 30 and 50 to enjoy then this be the game for you if you be still read here be some pro and con pro its fun with friend ballistic work fairly ok track animal be frustrating at time but rewarding when you get the basic right wide variety of game to hunt visual be beautiful con their business model be blatant 5 will get you 500em in order to buy a tent spawn point inventory you will need to buy 1000em as the tent start at 550em what can you do with the remain 450em not much worth mention maybe a lure or two the weapon do not have a this be how far the gun potetially shoot info section would help a little bug in the launcher no way to change the view distance its slightly annoying when you see something move sight down the scope and see massive grass cover where the animal be personal issue i run a titan x let me throw my view distance through the roof the game run between 140 and 190 fps with everything maxe steady 120 138fps in heavy woodland and forest i would not mind more visual rendering option to make well use of my hardware,pos

5115,early access reviewi be go to breakdown everything in the game but will not bother and will keep it simple although still longer than i expect my opinion solid gameplay with no game breaking issue that i have come across yet only have some weird issue with the matchmaking but its not frequent enough to be too bad if play with an organize group this game could excel even more but still fun play solo and most people do at this point if you can get it free weekend special as of post or on sale and your remotely interested in this game get it the dev have show they can develop it into a decent game the negative be in the fact this game be still be develop and need some more variety in gameplay map but really my negative be limit to that and i do believe the dev have show interest in properly develop this game and add more addition i suppose a second less negative be direct towards sci fi junkie if you observe the ship at face value they seem fine but when you read the detail they add thing like the of crew which be cool but its do very arbituarily a lot of the ship look like they be make of sheet of metal housing some bare bone weapon infrastructure inside if anything they appear to be remotely control behemoth and most actually appear to be thinly defend by say sheet of metal so i find it difficult to make out where exactly the crew on these ship live move around operate additionally the physics of ship movement do not add up with what be graphically display if i use thruster to go upwards and then stop use them which passively level my ship what i see be the nose of the ship go up with thruster below the nose clearly push it and the main thruster at the back of the ship give forward momentum but then upon stop my movement and evening back down there be no thruster above the ship try to even my ship out this be not correct as there be no gravity and if my ship even out thruster at the top should be visibily attempt to level out my ship of course we can try and derail this critique by my use of level out and upwards and the fact its in space but you know what i mean that have nothing to do with the graphic be incorrect since scifi junkie be likely to be the one most immerse in this kind of game its important to have those aspect correct microtransaction limit to skin essentially you can not simply buy a ship to unlock and use it there be a little more detail to provide in this regard but i will not bother just know that microtransaction be heavily limited and you will not see people with more money win every ship have its pro and con too so even if they could not like that mean they would be the good,pos

5123,i love car and 3d racing game and this game give a good explanation of racing with a variety of track and car to choose from but there be four problem first there be only one track you have to choose from as far as i can see and you have to pay for the rest of them and i use aussie dollar not usd so that make it even harder for me to buy the game currency second there be only two car you start off with the aquila and the bmw there both great i can tell you that but the aquila have just poor steering and same go with the bmw third i do not know how to earn the game currrency so that be a big problem for me last it say 2 hour to install and it take 7 hour and i have to wait a day for it to fully load i would recommend this game to car and racing fan but just look out for poor steering because the first track you use have a few hard turn and you have to really judge you turn because the turn most of the time be hard to make and when your in first person view you see the steering wheel only turn a small amount not go in a full rotation like other game you also have to wait a couple of second before the car go from n to d or n to r overall i do enjoy the game but its just those few problem that take some of the joy out of play the game i would give this game a 6 5 10,pos

5126,early access reviewi hate to have to get on the bandwagon but the new update be an abomination on one of the most unique and potentially briliant game i have ever play loot crate be a terrible system in any game but put them in one like this that be focus so strongly on creativity be a joke they need to go back to a currency base system that reward player properly instead of at random if they really feel the need to have one of these asinine blind bag system that focus more on exploit gambling addiction than any sort of fun it should be secondary to a more reliable system of currency like the one they throw out i be not sure what go through the mind of the robocraft devs but i have never see a game flail around so much in term of its core system it be like the whole thing be just an experiment and they have no actual vision for what the game should be many of the thing they have change over the year have be improvement but this one if anything it seem like a misguided marketing idea i deeply hope they come back to what make robocraft great some day and stick with it,neg

5131,a preety good game if you have a controller if you do not have one around do not even try to make it work you will fail the keyboard key be far too many to remember what they do in game and at the start you only have 2 aircraft to play with and the extra one have a huge cost to buy 5 euroe for an iconic plane if you can buy a controller the game be ok but you have to own a very good pc in order to run it,neg
5132,  do not test multiplayer no flight peripheral as much as i be use a keyboard and mouse to play with a few different keybind change i find this game really entertain the ability to use the shkval in the su 25 t to aim towards ground target and finally get to release death upon them just seem like alot of fun so i would recommend this game to anyone who want to learn on how to start up an aircraft or fire guide weapon as this simulator go in depth con really pricey dlc,pos
5133,early access reviewdude this game be absolutely amazing when i first see the preview video of it i be just think wow this game look like it suck but this voice in my head keep tell me to get it and that it will be worth so i get it and must i say be shock by how much fun i be have i quickly skype my friend and tell him to get it he think the same thing at first to about how the game look like it suck but get suck into it just like i do the character be amazing and have nice variety it kinda remind me of smite with some of the character and 6 legend rotation all this game need be more weapon and more online gamemode and it will be addicting to the point its the only game i play,pos

5135,i have no clue why people say war thunder be bad in my opinion it be the best free game out there people be really stupid to stay that the grind be long let us say you want to get soviet jet and your say it be too long your good be about tier 2 aircraft the thing be just use a premium aircraft or premium account yes you can get premium for free unlike world of tank where premium vehicle cost really money or gold to convert xp for vehicle in war thunder it be not like that if you have a premium vehicle you get 2x of lion and xp just research the aircraft you want tank and it will be 2x fast have premium and it be 3x faster sure you can spend a little to get your grind fast but there be also booster that you get all the time my point be people who say the grind be long they be pure idiot and people who keep say they get overtired and they always lose it be because they do not know how to use their vehicle properly in war thunder you need practice and use everything you have booster premium account to their full advantage and you will surely get that vehicle you always want,pos
5136,early access reviewin the battle of the good of the battle royale genre of game hi rez have decide to release what appear to be a well version of their paladins battle royale game you get to choose between several different class with all different perk the perk depend on which class can be either defensive or offensive graphic if you be use to hi rez game they be true to their same graphc as previously see like in paladin the character be cartoon ish but feel great the transition from foot to horse be the same as from the paladins battleground gameplay compare the graphic with fortnite it keep pace 8 10gameplay as in all battle royale games realm royale play out until there be one man woman stand do a bit differently realm royale have drop the player count to 90 overall there game play pace be steady between find crate throughout the realm with different perk and weapon you have the ability to breakdown item and forge legendary weapon after obtain a certain number of point make it easy to progress through the game cluck someone and chase them down can be some of the most hilarious and frustrating at time but it make gameplay fun 10 10 for not make me build to protect myselfalpha build the game be in alpha which you will see direct on the icon after you download it that be take into consideration i feel that the game do have a few thing that it need to fix some weapon such as the shotgun have already be deem to be useless they be very under powered unlike all other game other weapon such as bow and some sniper rifle seem to hit target even when they completely miss the target once fix be put in place to fix weapon i believe that this game can be one of the good overall laggy play have frustrate me at time but the game appear to get well during play 7 10 i be an avid pubg player and have look for something a bit more interesting realm royale make it very fun and entertaining to play a battle royale game again highly recommend this game i will see you in the realm,pos
5137,this be most probably the good flight simulator out there since i have see a lot of complaint about this i will just go ahed and say that this be not a game but an advanced simulator it be not mean to be able to download jump right in and fly around you really need to study how to operate the aircraft system to be able to fly it but once you know the control it be simply amazing thank to the immersion create by the graphic and lighting grant the price for the dlc be slightly high this be still not a huge problem since it take so much time to learn a new aircraft that by the time i have get good at it and still keep up with other plane i have the money to buy me a new one,pos
5138,don t let fancy graphic fool you you win t gain any joy from it and will only get irritade by occasionally break tank damage model mess match make balance and flip up vehicle research system that have severe grinding as a necessity so if you find cold war vehicle interesting i be sorry you get to either say goodbye to a few hundred buck or forget about your life for half a year could ve use this time more useful,neg
5139,i can not reccomend this game in it be current state this game be pretty dead by now i use to play it since the launch i do not have many hour on this game because i forget about this game for a while if you be play survival on your own heh good luck if you find one casual zombie you will most likely have to punch the zombie for 1 2 minute just to kill one zombie same go for any bat you find i literally shoot a casual zombie with m4a1 and i waste my entire mag on it i do not miss a single shot or if i do it be only once or twice you will also find people in squad and pretty much they will end you as soon as they see you or you will be snipe out of nowhere like pubg also good luck try to find food drink it may be one in a hundred even in a city,neg
5140,early access reviewright now i will vote no to this game i do not like the fact that i must buy different class right off the bat your asking for money way to early as a swordsman all i be really do be slash with my sword i do not get to learn nothing new as far as i know there s a few other choice give to me but like everyone else have the same power you know what i be not special i be just like everyone else and that make me mad you be nothing more than a sheep follow the herd i be vote down but i will vote up for fast download and smooth gameplay but down for bore grindy gameplay no fun here really,neg
5141,early access reviewso with 1000 hour of gameplay i belive my review can be consider relevant i start play this game almost a year ago and be really into it i know it be still in beta so there would be update and stuff so as the time go they add new stuff which be cool but then the update be not really update but downgrade with every single one the game get bad and bad constantly mess up with the stat of vehicle and weapon just get ridiculous even though the developer claim they want to have each faction different sort of gear good and bad they start to mess thing up so in the end it do not really matter what side you be play its the same the bad thing be that this game become pay to win so if you be not willing to sink hundred of dollar into a computer game do not install it after the last update the price go triple and possibility to earn credit in game be reduce by half another funny thing be that the developer claim there be 5 million player well there be at max 10 thousand online every time so i guess the total amount of active player can not be high than 100k which be 1 50 of what they claimto conclude it it get bad and bad with every update i will give it two week then i quit as well,neg

5146,if you love grinding or rich this be definetely your game if you hate grind do not even bother its just so repetive that you will not even be any single one of the stuff the trailer mention in 100 hour however the credit earning be double in high level so you will earn twice as much afater 100 hour then you would have when you be start the game however the point be still the same,neg
5147,early access reviewgame run very well on my phone and tablet which i have play the majority of hour on even my 4 inch phone be easily playable due to clever interface design the game be also synchronize between your device and steam account presentation artwork and progression card collection be derivative of hearthstone what this mean if you never hear of hearthstone be that the card animate themselves on the game board so it be easy to tell what their do attack creature smack the enemy fly creature hover spell shoot across the battlefield not much be leave to imagination as would be the case in physical card game which help new player keep track of what be go on card artwork skew toward cartoony but not in a childish way admittedly i be not a fan but that be personal taste player earn card through gameplay or opening pack but can not trade with other player at the time of this review the first pvp win of the day reward a pack of card this be an extremely generous way for player to complete their collection of common and uncommon card with minimal grind rare and legendarie will still require grind or the gameplay itself be derivative of mtg so expect 5 color playing resource defender choose who block and instant spell on opponent turn there be many keyword that take advantage of the digital space like warcry and echo eternal feature pve mode but they feel more like a temporary thing to train up until you be ready to pvp i be give this game a thumb up because easy pick up and play well polished presentation strong support for mobile device room for complexity and growthnow for the issue many player complain about the mtg style resource system that cause some game to be unplayble due to not draw enough or too many resource the mulligan system and certain card try to mitigate this but it be still there expect power screw but no bad than mtg 75 card minimum deck reduce consistency this can cause deck building to lean toward high quality card that be strong regardless of the deck instead of weak card that better synergize with the deck there be also a massive power disparity between legendary card and uncommon common these two point may be how direwolf plan to player towards legendarie and how they can practically give away common uncommon eternal require an internet connection to play even to pve or tinker with deck,pos

5150,early access reviewfirst off i would like to point out i have spend 40 hour in this game so far which be not much for that genre but be still enough to see what the game have to offer i usually do not review game in early access and try to avoid write pro con review but in this case i do not see how it can be avoid so here we go pro fast pace like hearthstone an average game last 5 minute maybe 8 if one of you be struggle somehow it be very rare to draw your whole deck free to play and quick to unlock i have unlock 20 to 40 of each expansion in about 40 hour and i have enough to buy 8 pack puzzle gauntlet basically enough mode to keep you play if you be not into competitive play and they count in daily quest to unlock more content similar to magic the gathering in its core mechanic with lot of synergy available and pretty silly combo especially with multicolor deck deck size can go from 75 card to 150 mana source include you can do a lot of silly stuff with that many card an interesting approach to weapon and relic allow your character to take part into the fight in different way also allow some synergy to become insanely strong with the proper combo of item on your hero wait in queue do not take too long usually within 15 second i have never have to wait more than 40 second for a game to start include week day late hour and such con i hate the mana management in mtg so i hate it here most of my complaint about this game be about mana management i just hope dev would not have include mana as card because most of the time we be draw too many of them or too few and we just sit there look at each other until something playable come up it be very frustrating to lose a game for not be able to play it at all or win against an opponent with an empty board for 6 turn just because you draw nothing of value for many consecutive turn with only 40 hour in this game i be already start to see a pattern where i will draw up to 20 mana card in a row yes 20 i count and lose without have anything to play the opposite be also true card to play but stick at 2 mana for 10 turn and my opponent just unleash astorm in my face even the ai in gauntlet tend to lose for not be able to play anything there be little to no randomness in this game but the way mana be manage be just horrible and break gameplay completely in the end i think it be what will make me leave eventually i would much rather see the power meter increase each turn rather than have to draw mana source i have notice that issue have be notice many time before me any search online will show you countless page specifically about that you be force to use mana source in your deck at least one third which basically mean you have to include at least 25 card out of 75 just for mana without count alternative source unit increase power unit draw mana multicolor monument etc in the end in any deck you create you have at least 30 35 card spend just on mana alone it be really not easy to optimize your deck building when mana be force into the deck in mtg i would usually manage mana with alternative source specifically to avoid have to draw lot of terrain and waste turn on bad draw you can not skip most card animation cutscene script turn in puzzle etc basically lead to a significant amount of time lose to thing that will not matter once you have see them once especially when retry a puzzle in the other hand some card you do not know have so much text that you do not have time to read them as your opponent play them the history of played card be not as complete or easy to read as in hearthstone which sometimes lead to confusing turn where you be be outplay and have no clue why or how it be use the same system as mtg unit will heal at the end of your turn if you build a deck accordingly minion with high health be virtually indestructible and will prevent any damage from the enemy board silence unit will not reset their attack health to the default value it only apply to specific buff so you can make some unit ridiculously strong and nothing will pass through i do not like that core mechanic in mtg and it also apply here even more so that you can build entire synergy make all unit on board gain effect strength and or health almost every turn there be actually an achievement in the game when you get 999 hp and i have take a couple screenshot in gauntlet run where my minion have 970 attack individually and about the same amount of health remember that i have play this game for about 40 hour only and imagine how break some synergy must be when you enter the high level of competitive play conclusion this be a very interesting game with a lot of potential but because it try to copy too much on already exist game without fix their flaw it end up be very frustrating or repetitive once you have manage to build an insane deck and you feel like there be not much you can do about it i would recommend play it for a while just to have a good look at it and have fun while it last but in the end i do not think you will want to spend real money or even keep play for year it be sad to say but because it do not fix the issue of mtg and do not succeed in entertain as much as hearthstone or duelyst gwent shardbound you name it this game be just another mtg clone,neg

5153,early access reviewhi today i will make a review that i hope will not bother you too much this game be one of the most special game i have ever play on my pc the mechanic of the game i stunning as well as the graphic which be well optimise for amd gpu now that sound good i guess the problem be find with the game be the lack of realism and the control of the ship you should have the spaceship be stunning but the interaction with other ship and the outer pace environment be not that great the metorit be too easy to avoid and they be too big maybe the goal should be to protect a planet instead of a gigantic ship now the next part be of course the game play now this be interesting because it be difficult for me to decide first of the loading time to find player be ridiculous but understandable for a game that be not a hit yet the interface inside a battleship match be not as user friendly as you may expect but it be okay the game be actually not bore at all but fun as heck you can enjoy 1 game of fractured space and it will feel like you play for 10 hour this be good for those gamer who do not have more time than 1 hour a day to play game now last problem i have be with people that be afk there should be a system that ban them after they be kick from the game if they repeat that reckless behaviour i would say that this game be worth play you can enjoy the game without put a penny in buy the great edition of the game i would give this game a 6 10 this be pretty good score for a free to play game enjoy the game and thank you for take your time to read this,pos
5154,early access reviewit good you guy its good ther server be work fine and you will find player have not encounter any hacker or game issue yet warmode be little bit of counter strike and a little bit of cod and give its tiny size 382 mb download its totally worth it,pos

5157,early access reviewi glance through the negative comment about this game and boy that be entertain the read whining of people who do not understand a thing about this game i will not spend my time explane why this be a good card game if you like mtg mechanic and want to see them implement in a hs like ui this be the game for you if you be use to hearthstone super simplistic resource method this game be not for you if you be an old dog like me who still enjoy card game with seperated resource card include in the deck which by the way there be ton of way to use the amount of extra mana you have for your advantage this be your game,pos
5158,simplistic roguelike with suprisingly large open world where it be easy to find yourself in challening area the loot in this game be very situational with most drop contain item from other class which be utterly useless unless you have friend or a group with you but with the large amount of drop it be easy to just ignore the useless one the game be also flood by spambot advertise a wow pay for gold system which be also easy to ignore for the simplicity and quirkyness it be worth the money to buy this game 0 be quite a bargain but it be great to pick up and play for a few minute in your spare time,pos
5159,i be not really sure how many hour i have at this point i start somewhere back in 2011 and have 2 max level acount this be by far the most intense and skill base moba out there every attack you must place yourself on the target there be absolutely no hand hold in this game now that it be on steam i can not hold myself back the only reason it take so long be because it be so popular they do not even need to bother get it now,pos
5160,early access reviewi really really want to like this game if it be not for a glaring issue glare so brightly the dev apparently can not see it i would heartily recommend it the issue be the mechanic around mulligan draw and power influence essentially at least 25 of the time the game will be over before you have a playable hand since your opponent be in the same position that mean half of game be decide not by the quality of your deck your play or interaction but by the game e you or your opponent over before one of you even get a chance that be bad than hearthstone the game where you do actually get to play meaningfully can be quite good so it have that go for it edit with the late patch even the game where you do not get mana screw be now utterin a naked attempt to over monetise they introduce a massively and obviously overpowered card and have since refuse to nerf it lead to basically every deck be a removal pile when a game that be suppose to be about creature be stick with a meta where you never get to attack with a creature it be over,neg
5161,as someone who have play this game for not very long it become easy to see that this game be a cash grab they seek to lure you in but the grind be mean to frustrate you so you purchase thing if you want this game sum up think of it like this this game be not free the game be a pay subscription service for it to be fun,neg
5162,i know that this game be suppose to be about quest but the creator have overdo it they constantly be keep you on quest but you have to do them they aparently can not wait a couple of second without either give you diologue or another stupid quest believe me i would also say that the enemy be a complete joke sure they be suppose to be easy right no they be suppose to be a bit harder than some stupid level 2 phoru why do they even make a game when the could have clearly look at some other rpgs game but they just go off of anime and cell shaded graphic do not get this game i think it may be one of the most lazily make game of all time,neg
5163,alright i have have this only for a month time may vary maybe 2 but i still love this game so much if you want a game where you crush enemy faster then i can say washermashen that s 2 second well your crazy because this be so fun i love that if you suck it doenst matter and that anyone can play it of course with vary success but if you have skill you can even take out a ninja with bloonjitsu with a team of sniper i have do that what be my life btw ninja be the good and sniper be the bad also the game have a system where if you buy stuff you suck in one thing and be amazing in another thing and if you do not buy nything you be the good recommend,pos

5165,i be not even into gun but this be a really fun puzzle game that teach you about firearm at first i think it be bore but it be kind of addictive once you get into it and if you be curious about how technical stuff work you can assemble and disassemble gun and you can also try them out and check every detail of their inner working now i know how to field strip an ak 47 i hope this knowledge will never come in handy in real life,pos

5173,i just reinstall and retry planetside 2 for the first time since it come out and i can say with unwavering certainty that its one of the very bad new player experience i have ever have with a game it be mesmerizingly terrible at give a positive first impression despite have just instal what one should reasonably assume be the late version via steam the game still require a lengthy patching process from its own launcher upon startup as well as a third party registration without the ability to sync with my steam account the tutorial be stretch over a needlessly expansive area and the narrator line frequently bleed into and play over one another if one move along ahead of the plodding pace it want one to needless to say this render any help such line could lend incomprehensible and therefore useless leave one to flail about and learn through trial and error rather than instruction instead the very first thing i experience upon connect to an instant action be get spawn kill with an airstrike not one second after set foot on the ground fan ing tastic the ui be one of the very bad i have ever encounter in term of give mechanical information to new player i know it show information on control area flashpoint how many friendly and hostile be detect in an area etc and that s all nice however there be some much more practical question it seem intent on not answer where can i spawn how can i change respawn location why when i attempt to decipher the help menu tooltip for the map and find that i must use warp facility to change spawn region be i greet with an insta death restrict area message upon attempt to reach one of those facility who know i be just constantly tell to click the instant action tab and let the game carry me off to wherever it think i be need regardless of whether i want that region or not when i attempt to ask other player in the game chat for clarification during the respawn interim of yet another spawn kill i be greet with the follow automate message the dead can not speak i actually utter an be you e kid me aloud in my office at this point i know planetside 2 be a well respected game and i be sure once one be familiar with it that there s some reason for that this be not about that this be not a comprehensive review nor be it a commentary upon the overall quality of the game this be simply a commentary regard the initial impression its current version give to new uninitiated player the short version be this i feel unwelcome not by the player not by my squad not by my faction but by the game itself as a newcomer to planetside 2 at every turn it seem as though i be get punish for not know thing that a proper tutorial should have teach me for not realize the answer to question i do not realize i even need to ask it feel as if it be deliberately obfuscate critical information that it just expect me to know without proper instruction ill make this as clear as i can my initial impression of planetside 2 be so negative that i have no desire to learn the lesson necessary to further understand the game i be sure the answer be there i be just leave with such a poor impression of my experience that i have no inclination to pursue them i be leave the game again and this time i be not return,neg
5174,i read a lot of complaint about this game that make little to no sense if you ask me people complain about micro payment you do not need to buy anything the wasteland and quest provide for everything you want to find own so pay for thing be optional other claim this game force you to come back every 5 minute because of the resource gather system this too be not correct thinking when you be not in the game the power water food supply do not drop under the minimum require amount of say good so your dweller will not starve if you have not play for 2 day it would not make sense if it be the case now would it and yet other complain that their dweller die of lack of water or food and that too be ridiculous just make sure you get enough dweller work the cafeteria s water refineree s and most importantly the generator room without power other important room may stop function and you can run out of water food that way also make sure you add dweller to job that they be mean for look at a dweller stat before you assign him or her to a room for example if you have a dweller with 1 s trenght and 4 p erception you do not want that dweller to work in the generator room because those demand s trenght so instead you send that dweller to the water refinery because that room demand p erception the high the skill level of a dweller the well he or she be suit for task that demand those skill it speed up the process of say room ok review time be this an amazing game hmm i guess that would be push it but it sure be a fun game look good have a million reference to current and previous fallout game with patience you can get all those item and dweller from grind the game itself no cash need unlike what some people try to claim this game be perfect for casual play but also for constant play questing be fun to do explore yield a lot of nice goody as well especially the longer you let a dweller explore the wasteland the trick to do this succesfully be to make sure they go out there with a high damage weapon and at least 25 stimpack say 10 or so radaway get them an outfit that give them a bonus on strenght perception endurance and or luck there be a great variety of outfit some with 1 add bonus other with 2 or more and also make sure the dweller you send have decent level of these skill then you be set and can send a dweller out for day at a time actual day do keep in mind that whenever there be a fight raider invade radroaches molrats gouls deathclaws that you do not need to do the fighting yourself the dweller will do this if they have weapon but you will have to apply stimpack and radaway to keep the dweller alive during a fight same in quest an icon will appear above the dweller when low on health click it and he she will use a stimpack or radaway just make sure they have good weapon and gear but all in all this game demand patience and some people do not like to wait that s 80 of the negative reaction on here i guess enjoy the game its free you know hehehe and not make by amateur,pos

5196,early access reviewit be very rare that i be unable to have at the very least a single praise for a game i do not like wow where to begin with this hot mess of a game i mean this game be bad and i mean really bad the map design feel like someone be just paint by the number add in only the most basic and mundane bore bland landscape imaginable oh let us not forget when i log in for the very first time i receive a machine gun volley of invite from every single random person imaginable i literally get 35 invite within the first minute of logging in which be enragingly annoying i could not find the setting menu fast enough to turn off notification an option such as that should be turn off by default see how a new player could get spamme into the ground with invite before they even put their foot in the door my gosh never have a game have such atrocious hit detection registry in all my year of gaming aiming in this game be a bad joke and attempt to aim with ironsights be just dog i line up a target in my ironsight take precise aim at my oppenent head and open fire like crazy only to find out i do not hit him once so throughout the match i sit there try to figure out where the hit detection registry allow me to damage my opponent and of all the ridiculous solution i have find this have get to be the bad i find out how to make headshot in this game use ironsights the trick be you do not aim for their head when try to make a headshot i know i be just as confused and surprised as you be by that fact you aim either at their crotch or the center of your opponent chest to make headshot which be a backwards and make no sense what so ever and then there be the blatant hacking in this game in which i get to say wow people who hack in this game be way too comfortable in cheat from what i have see these hacker walk around like yeah i be cheat the f you go to do about it in some instance they do not even try to hide the fact that they be cheat which be amazing in a depressing kind of way notice a guy on my team straight destroy people on the other team with just a handgun all the way on the other side of the map not say such a thing be impossible but to have such a high kill count with just a handgun shooting at extreme distance be not something a person can pull off constantly without cheat but not to worry the other team have their own hacker s as well so i guess the equation balance itself out in a kind of psychotic way shame on me for not notice this sooner i get rush by a guy with a shotgun and realize that not once during the entire match have he reload or run out of ammo as he be rampage around the map which be rather suspect if you ask me this game basically take all the element people enjoy in shooter game and combine them together but their execution in design around these concept be do in a very mediocre manner the problem with the designer be that they do not have a clear understanding of why people like or even enjoy these particular element in the gameplay i can only tell you about my personal experience and opinion with the game so if you be feel brave enough to play for yourself who know you mile may vary,neg
5197,not really sure why everyone be so negative about this game it be free for f cks sake yes i agree it be not 10 10 gaming masterpeice but it also be not 30 60 like the 10 10 game be do it have some glitch sure look at my play time it have crash maybe twice crash be not as big of a problem as people would have you believe be it miss some feature that other game have of course but for a free game it run well it have enough feature and be generally fun enough to justify the purchase of free 99,pos

5236,learn dota 2 be like learn the entire history of the world every civilization every war every political situation every nit picky historical detail except valve keep change the history every patch it take me 1000 hour to actually say huh i think i now completely understand how to play the game properly and even that be achieve by be a dota nerd watch guide theorycrafte 24 7 while eat or sit on the toilet or travel or try to sleep it become an obsession a challenge to learn the entire game only to unlearn and relearn everything again every major patch it be more mind strain than get an academic education or even try to get a phd i never think of the game as worth the effort and time investment so why keep play if one think it just be not worth the time investment at first it be the damn human curiosity experiment every detail and enjoy the result but after that phase 2 main reason remain too much free time and not have another game to play mainly it be the latter reason me and my friend would find some game play them until we be bore find singleplayer game finish them aand then there be nothing to do so no other game back to dota i hate this vicious circle i try to quit atleast 15 time delete the game several time while i have a really poor download speed try quit by remove my monitor from the house change the pw of my only account in window to something really long and give it away to somebody so i could not open the computer delete steam entirely several time and try much much more thing to quit i could not stick in the loop i keep try to improve my gameplay by watch high level player play and explain the game until one day i come across chilongquas youtube channel the first video i see he be non stop feed the enemy team while complain about the issue in the game such as i be 5k yet i always get match with 4k tain that do not know how to play the game you have to forcefully tell them on mic what to do last game my teammate give up and feed for a puny argument and if my game get ruin i be go to ruin someone else gamemy first thought be huh an annoying tryhard rager kid that flame everyone on voice chat just because he lose some game but the more i watch the more i understand his psychology and his reasoning behind his action it be a long story but in the end i eventually decide to feed like him just to understand his mentality even more and boy be that a turning point i analyze everyone reaction as i go down mid and give my life as a gift to the enemy team first i realize how and inefficient the enemy team be at kill me i run around under their tower and they still struggle to kill me this alone make me realize the enemy team be way bad than i be at the game my teammate react to the situation like expect but in the sentence they produce i be able to understand they be simply stupid the result be amazing i be enlighten after this feeding session i play my next game normally while still think in my mind that i be the good player in the game and i stomp that game i stomp the next game after that this be weird because i have be stick at that my mmr for year but the change of my mindset gain me 600 mmr in less than 10 day realize that i will almost always have to carry my team if i want to win i will always have inferior player to me in my team and the enemy team i be able to slowly stop play dota i realize the game as a whole be a pile of mess that can not be fix if you do not fix the player so my hatred for dota grow day by day and one day i delete the game for the last time it have be over 2 year since i last play dota the hatred kindling kindle by clq grow so big that i be able to finally quit clq have save me later i play dota again with my friend once several month when new big patch come but i be not get addicted anymore i be able to enjoy the game with my friend again this game be a vacuum that will suck your life and soul in there be no ending to this game valve will keep try to manipulate player to come back to the game by update even if the game be balance they will ruin the balance to keep the game interesting and fresh because its business more player play more skin sell more crate open even the i job of today do at least pay you back so you can buy food and some other thing you like keep your life go but dota do not do not live dota most of the player be not even play dota to have fun anymore they play it to shout and get shout at after a day of stressful work dota 2 be a psychiatric hospital that do not fix people it only make them bad i certainly do not regret any of my playtime i have on this game but i be glad i do not have any more hour than what i have currently spend on it if it be not for clq and the enlightenment he provide me i would have sink about 5k hour into this game by now sadly he be still play dota force himself to be positive and not rage he defy his own past defy his own opinion just because youtube be an income for him his position be just sad with that many hour you can master any craft study anything to become one of the good at the subject but if you sink 5k hour into dota you will still be an above average player if you do not go pro you get nothing in return stop lie to yourself you be not have fun play this game it become a stressful work a long time ago think about it if you do not agree with anything i say just go ruin a game purposefully feed and analyze the other player reaction one game will not hurt then think about all of the above again if you be already a high skilled but non pro player with your teenage year bury into this game think about other game you could have spend a fraction of time on and become one of the top player earn all that e sport money you can not get play dota 2 since you never actually play any other game while not think about dota in the back of your head you be unable to comprehend that there be other fun game out there that do not require waste 10 year of your 70 year life to learn 03

5243,if you be like me and get sick and tired of every other match base 20 30 player or less repetitive fps out there then i recommend try planetside 2 the battle be unreal no other game can truly come close to the sheer scale and scope of war that this game offer that be say i highly recommend watch some tutorial video on how to play before you jump straight in expect to wreck people you need to have thick skin because there be little to no hand hold you will immediately be throw in with other newbie and veteran alike and as other have say you be go to die a lot it take me quite a while to really understand the flow of battle and the importance of not just pick a class vehicle and only use the one because i like it this be a team game and if you want to win the continent you need to use the right class vehicle for the job just like you use the right weapon for the job yes the game be get old but i still find the graphic be pretty good especially at night definitely turn your shadow down to low off to increase your fps they can really hammer your cpu with 96 people run around in the same area the game can be a little buggy not usually game breaking and i hear people talk about cheater but i have be play since 2014 and i can count on one hand the number of actual cheater i have encounter this game be not pay 2 win all the weapon be very balanced and be mostly side grade if you die its probably because you be not pay attention at the end of the day i always come back to this game because it offer fps game play that no other game can it force you to really think about strategy and battlefield awareness on the grand scale if you try it and stick with it for a week or more i have confidence that you will start to really enjoy it and see all the great thing it can offer but if you just play for 2 hour and log off in frustration because you keep get kill you will just end up another salty review post on steam,pos
