early access reviewfractured space have a great deal of depth and tactical complexity a new player can pick up the basic mouse and keyboard command after a few match and yet a 100 hour veteran can still find new trick and tactic the recent change for ship acquisition make the grind for new ship very manageable new player can quickly pick up a decent cross section of ship while leave a few more expenive and new ship as goal to pursue the only purchaseable element be purely cosmetic or mean to bypass some of the unlock grind despite some review here this game be absolutely not pay to win the design team be very active in release new update to the game while some bug and significant ship balance issue remain as be typical for an alpha stage game the update have largely be incrementally improve the game for the past year and a half key feature deep tactially spaceship combat beautiful visual esp for an alpha manageable unlock rate no ptw element active development teamweaknesse some server lag and stability issue grow but currently limited player base ship balance still a work in progressverdict try it today fractured space boast massive spaceship look great and it be free there be nothing to lose and the game continue to grow improve and evolve with every update,pos

this game have get to have one of the bad tutorial mode i have experience so far i have be do the tutorial and campaign for two hour now and i still do not know how many of the mechanic work the tutorial itself feel throw together and not plan out the story they try to tell you sound boring and i personally would have prefer the game to not tell you any of those picture story at all or at least provide proper narration since the voice acting can not even remotely compare to that of hearthstone instead of tell you straight up what the actual battle phase be and what you can or can not do they make you go through the trouble of only be able to use the highlight card even though you can play other card in the actual game mode sometimes you be allow to play card before attack sometimes you be not but they will not tell you why that be the individual card skill be not explain properly and i personally struggle a lot because the voiceover itself be in english while i be force to play the game with german sub flavour text as there be no option of use english only or german only neither in the game setting nor in the steam setting this make any sort of immersion into the game extremely difficult the language setting thing be more of a complaint towards steam though and not so much to eternal as i have the same problem when play the witcher and some other game i do hope that they will release the english language pack for other country though anyways i have play hearthstone since beta and enjoy it until a year ago when i quit because of the greedy blizzard ecosystem where you either pay up or play mindless aggro deck i also use to play lot of yu gi oh and some mtg when i be little and some gwent after i quit hearthstone yet i be still have trouble with the eternal ruleset because of their badly think out tutorial system i decide that i will give it another 2 hour or so of playtime and see if the experience change somewhat or stay the same i must say so far i be rather disappointed i get that the game itself be suppose to offer more depth than hearthstone while not be as deep as mtg but should not they at least have give you a smooth start into the game instead of force you to play only highlight card for an hour while barely explain the mechanic or at least which mechanic trigger first so far i be everything else but impressed with the game it have some good core mechanic but somehow feel way too rush out like they need another month or two to polish it up properly,neg

early access reviewi have complete the game and get the bad end i have also get the other end this game start out really terrifying with the music and graphic but it only get bad monster will start chase you and sound will creep you out at point you be test on various task of survival there be many wonderful thing i could talk about spookys specimen 4 be one of my favorite enemy in the entire game the red bloody claw and calm behavior make her awesome spoiler warn the late game really test your patience and observance stalker water monster long hall and very awkward corridor make the monster who get faster later on more challenging you will make mistake ultimately lead to your death if you be not careful seriously this game can get fairly challenging at point i like it when game add challenge which the game lack when it be not finish the game be still fair once you know what you be do i also enjoy the bad end overall i find player may appreciate this game for what it be,pos
free to play without constantly be bug with microtransaction overall it be a solid game and with the number of god it take quite a bit of time to really learn how their ability can work together i would consider this game relatively easy to pick up and play but it will take you some time to really master the fine detail give it a shot its free and if you happen to hate it you can just delete it,pos
fractured space have come a long way since i first start play this game at the time of this review i have 155 hour play since its free to play release here be my thought on the game while loosely format around a moba it do not necessarily feel like i be play a moba rather fs play more like conquest in battlefront 2 you fight the enemy for control over certain area which lead to gain control of the battlefield and eventual victory i have yet to play battlefront 3 so i can not make a comparison there while the mission do not change the way you play can widely vary base on your ship selection and team composition each ship feel balanced however some ship or class of ship read stealth and sniper have steep learning curve on how to actually contribute to the game unlike some other game when edge case reveal new content especially new ship i get excited to play again unfortunately with a lot of new change come bug many of which have be persistent there be also some feature which i feel should be include but be not in game voice chat would be huge as well as a server browser to allow player to fill in for an ai pilot that be say i feel like edge case have be put forward a lot of honest effort to get the game to where they and the player want it to be pro fun blow away capitol ship be awesomegameplay reward skill and teamworkbalanced ship and content mostly mean this avoid be a pay to winall ship available on standard currency and currency grind be fairly easyrelatively consistent update with exciting contentgreat community available on reddit and discordcon bugslack of certain feature such as voice chat or server browsingpremium currency though with this be a ftp i have no problem support the dev saltclose thought my review here be lack some information as i have never actually play the second game mode frontier since this game be ftp there be no harm in give the game a try and you may actually end up enjoy it overall i would recommend this game to anyone who like pilot big ship and blow up other ship,pos
early access reviewnice game and a good take on the moba game even though it be in early access there be much potential in the game if it do not already fit that criterion however find multiplayer game fail too often,pos
this game be what make me want to get into pc gaming sadly this be a mediocre game with too linear quest and too much of a pay to win sort of set up for later level review score 5 10it be free so it do not hurt to try it out,neg
early access reviewall the game want be money they do not care about anything else now its ing hard to get money and you have to spend money to have fun this game use to be good with the back when the dev colud give adont get this game,neg
early access reviewi can not reccomend this game after 250 hour of game time the content be release excrutiatingly slow the matchmaking if you can call it that be the bad i have ever see e g during the current event i be rank 999th and get match with no joke the current top rate in the world constant mana screw flood this game be just a random luck simulator imo regret play every any second be warn,neg
this game be get slam for its business model and to that point there be some valid gripe the game be not really f2p and the free version should only be advertise as a demo and not a particularly good one the good way to play the game be to purchase a starter pack when if you do the game be phenomenal in its presentation and gameplay animal react as realistically as you could expect the scenery weather be beautiful and weapon handling be spot on there be ton of skill to learn as you go after different animal and the frustration patience factor be just high enough to make your harvest reward without make you rage quit,pos
early access reviewa year and a half ago and i would of thoroughly recommend this game but after recent update my opinion towards this game have change drastically with an almost entirely new combat system now allow bot to have more than one weapon type which completely break the nature of the game i like the idea of free loot etc after a game to ease the process of get item for your bot however the removal of the tech tree with the tier star be a bump downhill and really where my dislike for the game happen i could go on for much longer but i fear i would bore those of you read this review so i will put it nice and clear at the end here for you do not play the game they turn it into a load of,neg
most generous ccg i have ever play because you can earn dust vs the ai you can grind an epic card in about one day and a legendary card every 4 day this make this an extremely fun game to play as f2p if there be an awesome deck that you do not have the card for you can grind them up in a very reasonable amount of time this be my go to ccg and i have try them all i can not wait for the mobile release this summer,pos
early access reviewfracture space be a good idea but i do have some critisizms for the game1 when you leave the battle without ther game end there should be some reward not 0 credi and 0 ship research points2 there should be a way to have a matchmaker create game base on your ship and not you choose what game to joinplease note that i do get the game while it be during the free weekend where if you download it then you get to keep that copyi persionally be neutral about this game mean i do not hate and i do not love the game this be my review of fractured space nuclear poptart,pos
great game to spend minute on now and then pick it up go on a quest return to the nexus and do however if you want to spend more time on a game it be very fun to go on long rampage with friend,pos
i have not play much on steam but i have play for more than 3 year on the original website and some on kongregate this game be terrible i hate it so much why can not i stop play it,pos
a joke awful ui and all that have to buy everything about 4 map in the free version do not detect my xbox controller just get feed up buy a proper sim racer instead of have to buy ton of dlc for this thing,neg
i try almost every simulation outh there include iracing and i be excited for a new simbin title cuz i be a fan of simbim from way back with gt legends and gtr gtr2 so i be expect a good sim inste i get some acrila car that u can not get use to just like iracing u can not feel the road u can master a track but u can not master the grip its just unconecte no way neer gtr ad gtlegends and race07 i do not care about graphic so that s my opinion on phisic and engine a big fail from me but i understand they wanna make it more fun and driver frendly but in there aprouch the have miss me now a little bit of a content rewievit not a free game its a demo if u want a game with content u have to buy it and its not cheep i hate it its like star citizen sell u a model of something and price it not as much as star citizen but still its a 3d model and when 10 000 ppl buy it u end u with 50 000euro in cash do it cost that much to designe a 3d model of a car no so what be it a rip off be what it be they do not want to make a game that s why u can not play it standalone with no internet conection they wann sell stuff like star citizen cuz they have see the amoun of money sc earn robe off kid with money i be ok with that rip off all kid with money i could not care less but u will not get it from me i want a racing simulation that will work even if my internet connection be down i want to pay for a game not a car or a track i could not care less what track name be or what car be i drive as long as its a nice track and a good car phisic so i play would play rfactor with unlicensed car and track that work good rather then pay 200e for raceroom that have all licensed car that u can not feal and have to pay for a door panel and tyer that s what it boild down too they would sell i virtual wheel and windshield if they could but they can not so they sell car and track i be not in too that so what be the alternativesalternativesgsc as game stock car 2013 be a well sim on every level exept multipayer but that will improove when ppl realise that its the good sim on the market apart from irace that so expensive u can not even consider it in a category of 20 30e and do not feel as good as gscalso aseto corsa be well then race room and its cheeper but its not finish so that s my review boil down too if u have money there be no reason not to try to buy content but if u suport financial model like that u will end up pay for wind shield rim and car skin maybe even p2w like high octane fuel if u be smart u will suport game that do not try to get as much money from u but insted focuse on give u a pleasure of racing against ai and ppl with as much content as u like with mod oficial content etc so for me there be just gsc 2013 and aseto corsa that be on that level of racing i race too but that s for profesional driver not for a casual gamer race room expirience be a money generate machine not a racing simuator just like world of tank be star citisen and all other so call free game thank u simbin for not exist any more and make room for real racing gamer over at asetto corsa and gsc over and out,neg

decent game not perfectly balanced one of the well card game you can play it on android gwent be way well than it but hard to compare the two really if gwent be on steam and android it would overtake this by a long shot though the new expansion should breath life back into this game though it have a magic the gathering feel but with well mechanic not too complex easy to play than gwent and more convienent sorry for the comparison but those be the top two card game right now beside crapstone that do not balance their whole game so that will never be play again,pos

well i have be play newz on its own launcher off of steam for approximately one year or so this game have its up and down first off i wish there be less skin and more focus to add more content rather than expand the current with re skin this game can be extremely fun especially when play with a group of buddy and have a blast pvping get to get that adrenaline flow for harambe boy but other time it be just spawn die and then repeat that process which be uttely dissapointing fredaikas and the team have put a lot of time and effort into newz with one of the most outstanding anticheat i have see mlg anticheat on any game base off the game source and lot of neat feature that i can not even spend all my time write if you do not like the game and seriously come here just to write a review because it be like warz blah blah blah then you can take your two cent and shove it where the sun do not shine of course it be like warz it be the same god damn source it be upsetting that people can not appreciate all the work they have do in such a short period of time unlike the hp dev i appreciate the time the dev team have put into make a source that have a terrible coding structure and make it somewhat decent and playable overall rating 7 10,pos
the game seem really interesting and fun but at the same time it lack a playerbase at time i find it difficult to find people to play with and when i do it seem like it be a rather unfair fight half the time i win 100 or lose 100 no real like constant struggle battle,pos
i rather like how this game go people complain about have to be glue to your screen not true just simply save and exit your game and you can come back in 19 hour and it will only have deplete alittle and you can gather all your stuff i really love this game,pos
a big mistake people make when they try this game be that they quit before the game even start if you be willing to put some time into grind through the base story assume you do not enjoy the story 6 10 hour and learn about the layer of mechanic you will find your home in this game and developer the developer be super hard work innovative and they actually listen to their community with major content patch be release approximately every 3 month for free it be hard to see how any other game in the genre be able to compete if you enjoy arpg and be look for one with complex mechanic and endless character customization this be the perfect game do i mention it be freeeeeeeeeeeee,pos
what an insane game well do design the ship and sound effect it reall blast you away i recommend it to people deffenatly i enjoy every second of it non stop i have only 1 thing to ask of you guy be that you add a few more ship and more way to earn money and to spend the money on other than that absalutly crazy about this game so fun so so so so fun on my opinion also thank you for make the game free to play as i think that be avery good dessicion to make and must of be hard for u guy but you do the right thing shoot guy,pos

i can not really recommend this game as long as they keep the shell bounce mechanic in basically it do not matter if the target be paper at certain angle you have a flat percentage to bounce a shot regardless of your penetration or the armor of the target may as well be play a dice game instead of what have be market as one dedicated to realism,neg

if you love puzzle this be the game for you if you just love shoot thing this be probably not the game for you the basic premise of this game be simple dissassemble and reassemble every kind of gun imaginable from notable historic model to modern military piece even a few vehicle and some skeleton this game have a lot to offer anyone who love fiddle with intricate model and look at how thing work it be get a few negative quirk though as other have note the game be very unforgiving to those who do not want to pay for microtransaction if you be just a casual player want to look at all the different model expect to pay a lot even if you be really into the puzzle aspect expect to throw down a few dollar on occasion for that really nice model you want to try out another negative be the inconsistency between model some model will require you to pull apart every single little screw bolt flange and spring other will do most of the detail work for you dissassemble large amount of item with one click it can be especially frustrating when try to get the high difficulty achievement to figure out just how much attention to detail a specific model want you to have planning and memorization be key if you like puzzle though and be not afraid to shell out a few dollar now and then pick this up you will be engross pretty quickly i guarantee,pos

early access reviewfor an early access game it be very well do the control be responsive and combat feel very fluid the ship model be well detailed and beutiful unfortunatly they be the best look object in the game with space station and asteroid look very polygonal think n64 graphic with much well draw distance there be a number of bug some only cause the ui to crash but i have be crash to desktop a few time overall i would reccomend this game the core gameplay be great and while it do have the occasional bug and the graphic be pretty bad you have to remember that this be an early access game 7 10,pos

unfortunately i can not give all you new player who be hopefully dive in to this with its release an up to date opionion on start out but 1 5 year ago start out be quite easy and afaik not much and nothing drastically impactful have change since you be get nice starter deck and draft ticket and also you have daily pack quest to save for league seal or draft and two ai mode to grind for gold and pack also puzzle at least one of those should be your taste and take you on the road the game have a great community surround it and if you be willing to take your time and a few hint you get online then you be pretty safe to have a very good f2p experience which i myself have as well besides the world have an interesting flavor in my opinion and direwolf digital really step up their game with monthly promo card that you earn along the pack for your first daily win and story back them up the campaign anachronistically add a lot of great twist to the main story and character introduce through promo card that already catch your attention may be visit again which imo do a great deal to grant immersion also community resource be at a peak of availability and creativity you be also go to get ingame reward if you be catch the community stream the developer have a good sense of humor and they be do a great job in balance and advance the game properly and enjoyably give it a try if you want to be flexible and keep your investment low while still enjoy a top ccg this game deserve a chance,pos

tbh this game have alot of potential it be a pretty good game different enough from minecraft the graphic be very good the soundtrack be amazing the night sky be just oh so magical the corruption layer be hard as it should be and it be very scary as it should be the enemy be pretty nice and fun and definetly more dificult than any enemy in minecraft now let us look at the bad thing the recepy thing can get pretty annoying because you need to craft something that can be pretty expensive to get something you really need which can be pretty annoying but nothing horrible there be no goal at all yes there be some hide story in this but that be really not what you could call a goal i mean you can set yourself a goal but i mean that be pretty i do not want to be rude but that be kinda lame other than that this game have alot of potential and i hope the next update will bring many more thing not like the steampunk update that do not bring almost anything except for people who be able to purchase thing for money,pos
access reviewi rarely write review on steam but this game really deserve a good review okay so i be go to write my review the way i would love someone to write it general feeling that be beautiful my graphic card be middle low end and even with graphic set on low the game be a beauty the snow seem so real the feeling be so smooth that s amazing the concept be great not too many people in the battle royale only 60 per game and 4 final spot of winner in a chopper which be very realistic love that gameplay nice battle royale without bug without stupid dance or craft wood hum hum and a realistic snow style scenario enough people to be worry not enough to die instantly perfectly balanced as all thing should be personnalisation be huge aiming be fine realistic ballistic far ennemie you got to shoot a little high due to distance fluidity be really something that be miss for me in pubg and i be stun with the fluidity of ring of elysium graphic if you can not afford steep here be a free version you can snowboard in the snow of climb a cliff even paraglide your way to the safe zone and it be insanely beautiful sometimes i stop my chase and just look around the beautiful environment i can not even immagine what this game look like in extra graphic setup community great community on reddit and in official forum even in game i try to go with a team of 3 people and they be very friendly mute option push to talk option you be even ready if mr boring be in your team you can play it solo still very enjoyable you can play it duo that s for me the good and in a 4 group funny but not very serious depend on your mate pro and con graphic 17 20 free and no pay to win 20 20 smooth and accurate aim 19 20 realistic scenario 18 20 you can choose between third person or first person game 20 20 lobby matchmaking quickness and fairness 16 20 sometimes it go until 1 minute to find a game a total access to our statistic but not where we shoot in someones body etc 15 20 only one map beautiful tho 11 20 only one mode but its beta and more be come 13 20 so far only 60 people per game which be nice but a mode with 100 250 etc would be fun 13 20 a tier level style evolution but no ranking point and no competitive rank 11 20that be it but the general conclusion be that it be a wonderful game do not miss it out,pos
early access reviewwhat a game a very nice mix of hs magic and a little bit of hex very fair to the player fast paced and extremely polished the android version be also extremely well made and functional try it you will not be disappoint,pos

i have be keep an eye on this game in the store for quite sometime and now i try it out and it be not so bad it amuse me when i have the chance to play it these type of game be fairly entertaining from time to time when you feel bored and you do not want to keep play the same game over and over very cute and great art design 10 10,pos
the game itself can certainly be enjoyable at time but 90 of your time will be take up by the long and boring grind for vehicle and their module which most require to even function properly this be only make bad by a dev team that continue to completely ignore and then openly mock the playerbase whenever they raise legitimate concern italian tank be tease month ago and still we have nothing world war mode be probably never come development on naval force be at a minimum and air battle have see no meaningful development in year on top of all this almost all new content be top tier tank for the already crowd german soviet and american tree whilst the small british french and japanese tree get nothing the dev do not care about the player or the game they just want to squeeze as much money out of you as they can before the game die edit thank to the recent controversy gaijin have finally start to implement 1 or 2 positive change so there be a dim light at the end of the tunnel,neg

early access review5v5 space combat at its good interesting team combat but what i find most impressive about this game be the large divercity of ship with distinct playstyle moreover the ballancing be very well do so there be no ship which be simply well than other ship i have put a lot of hour into this game and have have a ton of fun still in alpha now but worth it,pos
this new interface be finally less buggy than the main dcs simulation modulle use to be run very well if your rig be at least 2 5 ghz dual core with the new nv 560 ti type card and 4 gb ram or well load time can still be 2 to 5 min for each new senario startup or multiplay code must compile something realtime or some thing or game space be setup as binarry arrays or math matracie or the like but wow be the simulation realisum and mutiplay senario worth it when it finally load absolutly unreal if your a fan of detailed aircraft simulation highly recommend and 1st module the su 25 t be free on steam now,pos
it feel almost sad to me to watch tf2 now sure it be still more of the same but i can not help but feel that the love that be once there be not there anymore this game be what pull me from xbox to pc so why do i just feel pity for this game run on for so long when i use to want to watch it become an unstoppable titan on pc with no end in sight i think it stem back to what i would call the peak of tf2 in my time of be around which i feel be love war because i remember how the game that be just become a little too stale get the big injection of life and fun with new taunt weapon and all around great memory however i notice something off after a week or so the community be become 2 faction and i have never see this before one side want to conga and party the other want a hardcore pub server every match i keep on playing though when a trailer name end of the line come out my hype be beyond contain and i think up so many weapon i have see that will possibly come to life on update day i have so many thought of how this be the update to end the game one last bang with everything and anything we could want or need when finally on december 8th we be hit with a crush reality where this update that have so much hype for turn into a simple cosmetic update and i be crush i keep play though with a pit in my stomach the new update roll out with quite a split gun mettle cs go skin in tf2 and people think the world be end and to top it off this update be a pay to play update to start the campaign however i be love every second of the new group tanut and the snowplow map not to mention i be in love with some skin like all good thing though i be quickly bring back down to sadness when invasion hit it have sound like there would be new weapon and a new game mode from all the hype the game mode be average at most and the reskin turn my love for the game to anger and i leave for payday for quite a while i return midway in the tough break update when i see a similar but different game the magic be just go for me at this point and soon enough other game catch my eye mainly overwatch where tf2 grow stale with me other people keep go i full departure from tf2 be meet your match when i feel as if tf2 change so drastically to just compete with overwatchs rapid growth in competitive play sure i have be read and it look like tf2 be back to how it be be for 9 year just with a different hat stack on it be head again i be not say you should quit tf2 because overwatch be just well or anything i just want to explain about how i break away from this game and thing i feel after 4 year on this game and many disappointment so if you enjoy tf2 still then more power to you and if you hate tf2 with a burn passion then i do not care about that either all this review be for be to say my peace about tf2 before i be do with it for good,neg
horrible game but it could be so good here be how the game go 1 get resource stabilized2 deal with random emergency fire roach infestation mole thing infestation raider 3 use most of your resource to heal your people4 run a mission5 slowly growth your shelter6 goto 1 it would not be so bad but 2 in the list be so obviously deliberate attempt to stifle growth attempt to have you buy a microtransaction it also would not be bad if there be some type of ai that would deal with the current random emergeny for example if you have a fire in a room with no one in it you have to manually drag a person to that room to fight the fire when he be do put out the fire he will just stand there even if the fire move right next door until you either move him again or all fire be put out move the people with a mouse be also very touchy clunky at time in the time it take me to write this review i have 2 random incident occur a massive fire and a massive mole rat outbreak just make some repetitive just to drain resource do not make for a challenge it just make it grindy and boring,neg
early access reviewgame be awesome till the new update i spend 1 week of daily play to buy 1 freaking gun its no fun anymore i can not just buy what i need anymore get to play freakin 3 hour to buy 1 stupid thing game use to be fun do not waste your time till they fix it,neg
a decent to good game ruin by some annoying mechanic and a small rather hostile playerbase with limit variety good gameplay overall be really good the ship be slow and require some patience they be suppose to be big hulking capital ship the combat be pretty good as well bad variety 2 mode conquest and frontline conquest have 2 lane towards the enemy base with a middle lane for a bonus fight every few minute frontline be basically the same thing but with only one lane and no middle bonus fight mechanic so you have 2 mode that both have the same similar mechanic and objective if you do not like one mode you will not like the other ship stealth some ship have stealth which in and of itself be not a bad thing the problem be that they drag the game down and be just unfun to play against game like dota2 do stealth right where you have some hero who counter stealth in and of themselves which this game have but they also have item you can buy and deploy to reveal those hero which this game do not have so if the enemy team draft a team you can not switch ship mid match and you can not see what the enemy be bring and you do not have one of the few ship that have a reveal skill you be sol double or tripple the frustration when compare to dota2 because you also have a 3 dimensional space your stealthed enemy could be it be just not a good game setup as it have lock in ship where you can not see the enemys draft but no option to counter if you do not draft one of those few counter ship yourself sound game audio be mediocre ship fire sound rather lackluster playerbase it be no secret that the game suffer from a lack of player the problem be that in the few recent pvp match i have play people be rather hostile that may not be an issue if the game have a decent playerbase but if you run into someone you do not like be prepare to see them in the next 20 match because odd be you will fight them again and again beyond that find a match for me have take everything between 1 minute and 10 grind unlock ship do not seem so bad but i also buy into the game early access and so have a lot of credit store up however ship range between 300k credit and 1mil credit while you earn about 10 15k each match it just feel like too much of a grind for me and that be before you buy the sidegrade for the weapon and ability the ship may have menu omg i hate the menu system in here such a pain to visit the hanger and find a ship as you have to scroll through a small little menu window to find it there be some filter but they do not help as much as you would think overall the menue be all convoluted and fill up way too much of the screen offer too little information and still manage to feel overwhelming overall the gameplay be good but it feel like half a game with some rather unfortunate design decision,neg
early access reviewoverall a great game after several playing need to fix a little bit about accuracy and speed on shoot maybe after release we can get new skin new mount or new chicken overall it be a great game,pos
i play this game before it launch on steam it be okay it be 90 hearthstone with some new mechanic and fast ramp to mid game the promotion of card where card you own get permanently impprove feel like a mechanic that give long time player a serious edge over newcomer which may be a problem in the future but it be free and very generous in dispense card pack so there be very little to keep you from just try it yourself edit after play this game some more i be now of a mind to caution people about what they be get into i like the gameplay far more than i do hearthstone as there be a lot more dynamic on the board through heavy removal and influencer but i do agree that it be p2w or at least as much as hearthstone be once you get through the newbie rank you will start hit the opponent with more legendarie and promote card some build have more than 10 legendarie in them and they be legendary for a reason on the flip side the cost of craft card be the same as in hearthstone while the chance of draw a card be considerably less tesl use 50 card deck so 1 50 at the start of the game this mean that craft card have less impact on a build and it will take long to catch up to the people who decide to spend money on pack and exclusive ie card you will never get if you do not pay for them i still enjoy the game and i hope you will too it be just a shame that this balance issue be weave so deeply into the business model of this game,neg
really enjoy this one right now while not the elder scroll game i be sure that everyone really want it be definitely worth play if you like ccgs especially so if you be also a fan of elder scroll lore and theme,pos
early access reviewvery well optimize right now for an early access definately an underrated game gameplay be fun and challenging i can play with a gtx970 at 1080p on ultra and keep a stable 144 fps most game of this quality run at around 60 80 fps with my card the game look incredible for something that run so well not an easy game in any way the good player only win about 55 of the time,pos

early access reviewso far aqw trump aq3d by a long shot but only because aq3d be not finish yet artix entertainment could add some story element as well as some scene from aqw but for now it just be not worth play yet but do not count it out yet it be still get work to do,neg
early access reviewdont waste your time and money on thisjoke of a game i play it for around 27 hour this week and that be time i be never get back unless you like play for hour on end without unlock anything only be able to buy the starter garbage weapon and jeep and like be spawn camp by tank and sniper all day the dev of this game be try so hard to force you to buy your way to power instead of actually play the game 0 10 untill the dev start make a real game decide to give the game another go to see if it get well spoiler it do not this game get bad every damn time you play it the game be full of bug such a bolt action rifle look like the they shoot twice so the shot you intend to hit some go into the next postal code complete broken spawn system its also super easy for one person in a heavy tank to spawn camp your entire team most battle end in either total stalemate or a massive blitz that smash one team at this point it seem like the only thing that actually work in this game be the insanely overpriced store where you can buy yourself all the power in the world only if you be dumb enough to even give these dev a penny for this joke of a game i have a really hard time understand why anyone would ever support the dev or this game what so ever when all they care about it take your money and clearly not use it to improve the game at all 4 year of be in beta should give you a pretty good idea of how little the dev care about their playerbase save your self the time and disappointment this game be and move on,neg
early access reviewi really want to like this game but it be hard there be a problem with the design 75 card deck with 4 of a kind rule remove consistency and the mana screw flood issue also cause significant frustration you even have to build your deck with min 40 of your card just deal with mana sigil problem and even then most of the time you have screw flood lose a game without even play be not fun it be really frustrating,neg
note thehunter be a niche game it be a wonderful niche game do not get me wrong but other than the gameplay itself i have nothing but issue with it compare this game to the big name game out there cod bioshock farcry skyrim and so forth ignore the genre production value and sale be what i be compare here in all of these big name game have one thing in common you buy the game you can play it all of it you unlock gear and item as you play through you do not have to buy additional junk just to complete mission progress through the game occasionally you will have expansion or add on more dlc that you can buy that will in most case extend the gameplay but in all case will at least net you more content of some kind so i will take cod one of the best know most loved and high selling franchise in the gaming industry i think i pay 60 when it first come out that be it for the whole game all equipment all level and weapon attainable for that 60 oh i forgot to mention that you own the game at that point you do not have to buy a membership to enjoy all of the game content now thehunter free to play no it be not mistitle it be deceptively title the f2p portion conain one rifle one scope a bleat call a camera a gps and binocular oh that be fine and all but you only get to hunt one animal mule deer on one reserve if anything it be a free demo if you expect to see the rich content in this game forget it this demo be nothing more than a snapshot ok so that be what you have get for free let us spend 60 on this game like we would any other and see where it get us 45 for one year basic and another 15 for three more month that be it that be what you get i would love to say that you get more but you do not you get 15 month with no additional gear no additional weapon oh you do get the option to hunt on all the reserve you also gt the licence to hunt all of these animal but you still can not because you have not buy the proper weapon proper ammo proper equipment so you have to shell out more money just to take advantage of the fact you just shell out 60 for 15 month of play time what be that do i just hear someone squeak the word world of warcraft deny wow at least give you access to all of it be content after you have pay your subscription and no i be not go to complain about the subscription as wow be be an mmo get to maintain those server yeah i know thehunter have multiplayer big deal out of the 20 people who enjoy multiplayer thehunter could loose all 20 of them and still be a perfectly great game as single player only you guy want to make more money add the cottontail and a crappy shot gun to the free to play version and call it a free demo sell the game for 30 and monthly membership of 5 make gear and weapon unlockable get rid of the microtransaction garbage i would buy this game for 30 i would pay a 5 subscription if i have access to all of the game content after i make those purchase that be at least 35 you guy would have make from my first month 5 and maybe even more a month after for my continue subscription however due to the way you guy have decide to sell this game i have spend 15 for the subscription have my fill becasue i refuse to spend more money on trivial and temporary purchase and that be it you have make 15 from me and you will not make any more i do not recommend this game sure download it shoot a few mule deer and call it quit for the price you will be pay to make anything in this game available for use and the fact that these be only temporary purchase subscription consumable this game be not worth the disk space it occupy even with wow purchase when it be release and play for the first year at about 180 be still cheap than this you want a good hunting game play cod or farcry or bioshock you get to hunt people and monster you get ton of weapon to choose from you do not have to pay a monthly subscription and your purchase be yours to keep do not spend a dime on this game,neg
this game be well than i expect it do not lag too much on my eight year old laptop run vista and the game itself be actually fun character design take a while depend on how in depth you go the game pay feature do not seem to be too intrusive and all in all great game for free,pos
early access reviewi have play a few dozen match and have love this game so far the ship look great and be detail the weapon be varied the match be interesting and dynamic there be different way to win and even though blind pick be a little annoying they be look to fix that to bring more mix into the game the game be young but i be amazed at how complete it feel in it be current state there be a huge update that some poeple be not happy about i be okay with it last week and development show no sign of stop we get tease all the time and the dev be super friendly stream multiple day per week no other game have get me into the development process like this i love it now that this game be f2p and it truly be i highly recommend try this game out,pos
early access reviewstarte out rough but they be churn out patch really frequently and it seem like they genuinely care about the communitys feedback i would not recommend it now unless you want to be there during the optimization process but 6 month down the line thisll be a great mmo if they keep the ball roll,pos
it be fun sure but when they switch from a tier system to a lootcrate system i lose almost my entire setup and the arena become very unbalanced i do not enjoy the pay to win system nor be i glad to see it in robocraft i be disappoint freejam,pos
general nice game i think that i just find a severe bug which force me to start over again that be i want to see if i can use card from one deck in another deck so i almost empty one deck i just leave there 1 insignificant card so i do not have to delete the deck then i open the second deck anddid the same then i return to the other first deck and out of the sudden i only have 39 card leave before i have over 50 card in that deck i switch back to the other deck again same problem no i can not assemble one single deck with 50 card have to start from scratch the dev team really need to hire more tester please do not save when it come to quality now i be consider to start over again or not,neg
this game ing suck it be pay to win if you f2p expect to get roll on by everyone the programming and algorithm be build to make you as frusterated as possible if you do not put money into it fact do not kid yourself and think the developer would not do this it be obvious do not expect fair match make do not expect to have fun past the first story mode all it do it make me angry and that be not what gaming be about hey if you want to throw hundre if not thousand of dollar into the game i be sure you could compete and maybe have fun probably not this t and you bethesda,neg
10 10 deep and engaging story with well rounded character progression find out use left hand to click be pretty easy will be recommend to my mother and sister ia ie ia,pos
early access reviewit be early access but the graphic be dingy you have ton of hacker lag absolute crap for weapon balance insanely low recoil spread even cod have more combat feel shallow and uninspired need a ton of work to even be fun especially to be match with people who actually speak english or live anywhere near to the state overall rating 3 5 10 would not recommend,neg
great game do take some money if your lazy impatent and weak willed because in the mobile you can do some offer i stop play the game for a week just to get 2000 gem kinda be worth it cause i get 5 dragon battle for the edge expansion pack the mini game pack aswell though the battle for the edge be kinda short wish it be long for how it take me to get the gem to buy it but it also give me the ability of hideout aka a house on dragon edge you can decorate its a cool idea so the game could be classify as a pay to enjoy but i spend no money on and i be do pretty good so no need to break the bank just go to mobile complete some offer i spend well over the hour that s on steam cause i play mobile alot more sense its more convient so i would recommend the game to little kid or people who be hard work and will compelete the offer for gem it be a great game like i say but need more to do and more big storyline plot like expansion that you do not need to buy just like get a expansion that s part of game by get like a certain amount of udt ultimate dragon trainer point and add more quest that be just go get this fish or this plant and add like quest for island from expansion that be unlock after buy the expansion but do not have anything to do with the story the whole island locking thing kinda limit the quest creativity but over all if you can get past the part of need to work or spend money its a great game wonderful graphic so go ahead and download if your a true fan of httyd then this game be perfect for you and you should get over the flaw of money,pos

early access reviewthis game be incredibly fun but i would like there to be more ship maybe a fast and manuverable fighter mean to use hit and run tactict to destroy enemy ship i would also like if a first person view be add and i wish that the server be more populated but other than that its a great game,pos
early access reviewvery nice game it have a nice variety of playable deck very rewarding in contrast with the other card game out there definately play as free to play you can make a playable deck in rank pretty soon totally reccomende it,pos
to be 100 honestly this game be addict and fun however that s for the first 100 hour then the fun go away and begin the hour of grind to get enough loin or enough rp to get anything above the br battle rate 5 3 the good part be when you get the vehicle have fun try to break even when you get one or maybe two kill per game it get bad when you get into game 6 7 and up yet for real world money you can get a premium account for xx amount of time and golden eagle with premium you can join a game die and still make loin with rp do not want to put the time or work in just buy golden eagles then you can now increase your rp or loin and even buy premium vehicle and yes its a free to play game and they need a way to make money however with problem like skill cap be too high for some br and matchmaking be a joke have fun be up tier 70 of the time i do not see why they should push microtransaction when they be many part of the game that need work but it new plane and premium tank for only 40 00 should be the high priority,neg
good race sim package on the marked right now there be no way around r3e real racing series wonderfull content option you only need to buy what you actually drive want to join gt3 3 buck for your favourite car and you be in i be kinda lie here you need track as well the sum will still be well below a full price title good sound in genre good ai in genre physic be simbin quality multiplayer be top notch i play pretty much all sim in past and present besides ac which do not come close in term of content ignore reviewer who do not understand the economic model of the game,pos

early access reviewwhat start as a great creative game with a few cash option have be twist into an unadulturated cash grab on the level of mobile game i start play this game essentially as soon as it be release its have its teething problem no doubt and balance issue be understandable i stick with the game through those issue because hey its hard to balance a createive game but the most recent change where all of your income be basically a roll of the dice no skill require have do it for me it be clearly set up so that you can buy box or cash to buy part outright but you can no longer simply rely on your skill level to ensure a good income level therefore the advantage easily pass to people who be willing to buy their way to the good part tl dr be once about building be now about buy,neg

a one of a kind rough diamond i enjoy planetside 2 since the release and keep on do so untill it may run entirely out of player one day yet despite many people claim this game would die this day seem still to be year ahead i be always amazed about how dynamic battle can become when once you be in advantage siege a base just to be flank attack by a coordinated batallion of tank and aircraft drive you back to the wall of your own base that you have to defend desperately hour and hour of hard fight and fun this game offer everything a fps gamer could long for massive battle sneaky stealth mission to disable the enemy defense dog fight tank warfare a well execute squad and platoon system high reward for support duty like revive repair counter hacking and healing what ever role you want to play just do there be no limit on what ever kind of weapon and vehicle noone hold you back noone claim vehicle exclusively to them like in battlefield this game be purely for you to enjoy the way you want yet there be some consideration you have to make when get start the game offer you a fair beginner package of all weapon and equipment need to fulfill your class the beginner weapon be all jack of all trade master of none so keep that in ming when you encounter your first enemy with a shotgun up close also you have to consider that this game have some age behind its back and there be people who simply unlock way more equipment than you have and be better train in the mechanic of this game this may be frustrating at first yet as time progress you will grow and improve and so do your equipment it be not battlefield where you can unlock your entire class in a day this game be design as many mmofps rpg that the player stick to it for a while anyone who ever play a mmorpg like guildwar or wow will know that become one of the good consider the equipment involve time none the less this do not prevent you from beee able to have fun even though your own tank may lack the powerful secondary gun and utility equipment you can simply jump into a tank own by a experienced player and use it people play together in this game and people share their equipment simply ask in the world chat and someone will respond to you there be day when this game can be frustrating as so many player 300 at once in a battle can cause net code implication or it can simply be to much for a single player to process rocket fly more explosion than in a michal bay movie and pesky sniper everywhere just remember this game be yours if a battle become frustrating because you be outnumbered or the region start to stutter from all the people run around do not respawn time after time and bang your head against a wall at those time you can simply swap from the big battle into small skirmish of 20 player and enjoy a much calm match the map be huge after all and you have 4 entire continent for you to choose so if you be displeased then take a short break or simply join a small fight lastly if you ever feel that progression be to slow just join a platoon and squad usually community platoon leader use 50 exp boost to help out their mate since leader gain point from every player level up during their lead you will see that this help your grind tremendously and increase the chance of quality teamwork even further just when you start create a character on every faction play them until level 5 and decide on what faction to stick with though you can come back to other faction anytime you like weapon unlock be faction exclusive though unless buy with real money also keep in mind that this game really take a day to adapt to it you will die a lot in your first hour and this can become frustrating but the learning curve be exponential and when you only have 0 2 kill in your life at the beginning you can easily go beyone 15 kill later enjoy your time on auraxis,pos
this be the good thing that have happen to me i know a lot of people think it be a p2w game and that it be repetitive but if it be super easy to get everything then where would be the fun in that i think people should work to get thing and do the same thing over and over because that be basically what we do in real life we do the same thing over and over for our whole life only to enjoy 15 20 year of it in comfort so what i say to all the people who think it be a terrible game and be under the age of of 14 just know you will be do that exact same thing in the future,pos
early access reviewplaye when it be part of paladin for the day it be great and i like the change they make as a stand alone game too although it can often seem like nothing be happen which lead me to the only thing i would like to see do like a small map for more intense play and maybe some cross game currency and battle pass like my gold gem and bp on paladin should be link to both game as originally it be go to be one game i think all the fan would love this same with the mobile game maybe even some skin to idk how or if they could but it would be cool to see a buck skinned toon run around the realm,pos

i do not really like the tank but the plane be a good mixture of realism and arcade and be pretty fun i would recommend you play this game if you just wanna have some fun with the plane but the long term playability be crap it be super grindy to progress like it be more grindy to get top tier with 1 faction than to max a character in world of warcraft level of grindy so if you have fun in the mean time it be great but if you be after high tier either pull out that wallet or just skip it also though i come in later many reviewer say the plane have not see any major updating in year which be a shame some housekeeping may get me back in on it otherwise not so much,neg

early access reviewvery slick card game that sit in complexity between hearthstone and spellweaver what i appreciate most about it be the refined interface that allow you to play quickly without wait for animation to finish and to have access to all info you need about the various card effect the mtg inspire battle mechanic be pretty good as be the instant system which allow you to react to enemy instant stack effect until one player stop reply the only thing i sometimes wish for in spellweaver though that be definitely a tradeoff that will slow the game down when face some player the number of game mode available be also laudable everything from gauntlet vs the ai to rank to draft this say compare to spellweaver or hex i find browse the card collection quite yawn induce the effect on most card be not very inspiring to say the least they do not fire my imagination about potential synergy and combo like the former game do in the end i be recommend it as fast food it be easy to get into they even give you pre make deck regularly so you can just jump in without know a thing about deckbuilding and you will already be play something more interesting than starter deck,pos
i think this resemble hearthstone too much that say i have only play 2 or 3 game of hearthstone a long time ago in general i like the elderscrolls touch of everything and how they create the card for the specific race i mean there be some error or change for some race since morrowind but well my problem be the gameplay i be a fan of magic the gathering and i really do not like how you play legend or hearthstone even yu gi oh be more fun to play as the the genearl gameplay be more fun for me like how you attack and defend and all that jazz i think a lot of people who like magic will not like legend or hearthstone as a fan of elder scroll you still may want to play the story mode that s all that i can recommend as it stand now,neg
early access reviewman this game be just so fantastic i can not state how much free stuff this game give you between the generous ladder system to casual and draft craft cool card and play fun deck be always at your fingertip a nice departure from hearthstone and other stale ccgs and a great alternative to magic the gathering 10 10 would recommend,pos

early access reviewcollectible deckbuilding card game can be a lot of fun they be not however a legitimate form of mind to mind competition they be certainly enticing and stimulating to be sure the illusory pull of be able to come up with strategy and collect card to support that strategy building from a core idea into a set of technique and then unleash them in match test refine it all sound very cool the problem be in the internet era an individual effort just do not amount to much and furthermore there be far too much luck involve sure you can make progress as i have do with homebrew deck from time to time depend on whether the meta allow for the strategy i try but for the vast majority of player you must pay to win and bow to the whim of how the community be build its deck the specific game in the ccg genre all have their quirk but in every instance you be up against the meta the game be less about refine your own idea than it be about efficiently farm card to steal the idea of other that have be test in far more match than you could ever hope to play on your own it be about take advantage of momentary swing and imbalance in particular card combination look for a weak spot that will rocket you up a few more notch against a ton of other people try to do the same you be not test your own idea so much as test the idea of the community and its ever shift whim and then change tactic when you get counter i do not find the idea of try to eke out a more than 50 winrate with deck i do not make up very appealing nor do i like the idea that all my individual effort be mostly for naught when compare to a whole internet full of people use particular premade netdeck that far outclass me throw hundred of dollar at the game to get all the card they need sure i can try to scrape something together and compete i can appropriate their technique but all i be do be play the odd hope i draw into lucky string of card to make my combos work hope they do not draw into theirs hope that if we both draw into our deck ultimate concept that mine trump theirs in the meta that they be not set up to counter me i have do pretty well with my homebrew deck but once you be mire in the silver rank you will start run into deck use enormous amount of synergistic legendarie that be most likely buy with real money sometimes draw luck be on your side other time it be not do not get me wrong this be still fun a lot of the time but it be not a direct competition between mind there be too much other crap in the way there be a certain amount of skill involve in play the card deck correctly but at their heart ccgs be a matter of who have the time and the luck who be willing to steal the good idea efficiently compare the strategy in ccgs to the strategy find in a game like go for instance where every piece have the same property and the rule be very simple with no randomness yet the depth of potential strategy be so all consume that people dedicate their whole life to the game and the game be capable of open itself up to high and high level of play as you progress in a card game the piece you even have access to be base on either your wallet or grind out the hour in a sense this may be similar on the surface in that more time more power but there be no set of piece you unlock by study go for 1000 hour that will automatically win game for you once they be all out on the board you be never stick with piece in your bowl that be unplayable because you lack some other amount of power or find that you reach into the bowl and there be no stone in there to draw out and play your idea have a direct expression on the board at all time and the well your idea the strong your purpose and the more efficient your play the better you be at the game in a direct correlation so all that say eternal be still a pretty good example of a game in this genre it be pretty close to m tg and have a lot of great element that make it shine with a hell of a lot less rng than say hearthstone the attacking and block mechanic engender some interesting mindgame and back and forth but it be still a collectible card game at the end of the day and bind by those same limitation i will finish this out by say that while i still do play eternal quite a lot and i usually enjoy my time with it i can only provisionally recommend it to those who be willing to put up with the usual pay to win collectible card game frustration present in every example of this genre if you be up for struggle quite a bit against factor outside of your control for the sake of the occasional dopamine rush of an earn win intersperse with a lot of unearned win and loss well you could do bad than eternal it certainly while away the hour and what more can we ask for i would also like to pose a somewhat rhetorical question what would be so bad about give all player access to all card right from the start and charge a reasonable price to purchase the game or provide the player with an option to draw card instead of take an action like infinity war do then much more of your success or failure would rest on your own ingenuity rather than rng and time money spend just unlock the ability to play the game or get screw out of power or card draw,neg
this be one of the great game ever conceive by a group of mortal mans mind so many option so many people an almost perfect simulation of war work as a team to take down your enemy in a gigantic landscape by foot tank or air this game be not gentle and will easily scare weak minded and yellow bellied scardy cat away with its immence battle and epic perfection i have personally watch a level 5 greenhorn yell profusely to his comrade to shoot him in his face because he have no idea what be go on good part be that it be free and not a pay to win 90 of everything you pay for be for vain selfish and stupid reason ilke helmet that look cool that you can not see yourself so you just have to hope your squad be tell you the truth that you look cool or you can buy a camo the semi work or you can buy a make up kit if you be the dirty dirty vanu scum you can buy gun with cert that you can earn for playing or just pay a few buck to get a gun that be not much different then the one you just have all the gun be basically the same you just have to find the one you like it will be your gun there be other gun like it but that one be yours i have a hour or 2 in this game so trust me you will have a great time,pos

more complex than hearthstone hs less than mtg with a very fun meta game right now you can play it f2p and i personally feel it be much fair than hs in that regard but not as generous as duelyst or hand of the god the visual do appeal for me personally but some may find it too bland i think fan of the elder scroll franchise will be quite happy though,pos

update the game have be get bad and bad and i think it be funny how the trailer say million of player in one grand war when the entire player base be around 6000 at this point i have to say my rating have drop to a 4 10 300 hour of the game have teach me a few thing most important being that this game be grindy 0 doubt in that but in my opinion that be the aspect of the game that make it stand out from other fps game that and the fact that it be one of the few ww2 themed mmo fps around sure when you start the game with your horrible sa rifle which take 3 4 hit to kill someone you will die a lot a lot but one day you think okay i be get well at the game i have figure out some decent strategy with my starter weapon so you go in and try them die a lot again but you try again you die a little less and after a while 50 75 hour you start to get the hang of it it be really these first couple of step that separate people who be use to cod and cs where there be little none grind and then these people may post some pretty angry review just because it be different of course another important fact be that strong weapon can be buy with real money another thing people complain about however hour and skill generally go hand in hand so even someone with a purchase gun be beatable if you be more experienced then them a good way to go about these people be to 1 kill them 2 steal their gun 3 kill them with it 4 repeat step 3 until satisfied so to conclude i recommend this game for people look for a different experience to traditional fps game where everything be available right off the bat,neg

this game use to be some fun then the dev decide they want to double the amount of xp you need to unlock individual class now you can not get anywhere at all unless you be willing to drop irl money on class vehicle and gun while you could technically buy unlock these with the in game currency it would take you age to get enough xp and in game currency to do so unless you be willing to sink irl cash or a ridiculous amount of time in this game its honestly not worth it,neg

i be surprised that i do not have a review write for poe i have 2300 hour play on the game let me preface this review by state that if you know anything about the arpg genre then you be probably already play this game but if you do not this review be for you with all my experience i hope i can help you make the decision if this be the right game for you so without further delay let jump right in the pro this game have a lot of content more than most free to play game i have play the developer actively and in a timely manner release new content item and game mechanic on a 2 3 month cycle they diligently pay attention to the continued existance of their game i respect them for that the game be hard especially for a new player don listen to people who write in their review that the game have lose all challenge these be usually people with thousand of hour play use the most expensive build in the game to trivialize content like those build be mean to in this experience you can really fine tune how challenge the game be if you be after that the game have a very deep level of customization for build you can pick it up and play it no matter what you build but do not expect your first build to carry you far this game be most of all a learning experience knowledge here really be power the visual design and music score be great they really work to bring the world to life there be plenty of lore hide in item description and place around the world you can also build your own hideout from different item that the master npc in the game offer if you be into that like me this game be truly free no content be hold behind a pay wall crazyi know but do not expect it to be give to you on a silver platter however no matter what you do every moment you sink into the game be worthwhile everything you pick up no matter how incrementally lead to you reach your goal that be something that i can not say for most the experience on the market the con the game be hard and unforgiving you will die to random thing while play and have to piece back together what you do wrong if you do not want to die again do not get discourage it happen to literally everyone trading be an essential skill you need to learn to get ahead in the game but the trading community be very toxic people try to make a profit constantly prey on new player so learn how to use poe trade and check it to make purchase and sale know what something be worth before you sell or buy the learning curve be steep but there be plenty of resource to prepare you for it you tube guide the game forum and the amazing wiki have everything you could ever need to get start do not ask people in game to explain a nebulous concept to you most of the game mechanic require several paragraph to explain use those other resource and feel free to ask specific question about what you want to know the gap between the rich player and the poor player be truly vast bridging it be impossible without a lot of effort you can not pay to win and if you do to one of the illegal bot expect to get ban the developer stay on top of that in my opinion this be the good arpg on the market and it keep evolve to stay that way i enjoy play and support a game make by people who convey a level of professionalism one expect from people run a business and not just work on their game hobby,pos
decent enough game though it seem like a complete rip of hearthstone still seem like it be an early stage infant game need to add chat window or option when play against a human opponant,pos

fantastic game first thing first if you be expect cod floof op ii you be go to hate this game this be not a game where you will be wander round the countryside with a 50 calibre sniper blast deer and bear into the next world you do not get to call in air strike and there be not action every 2 second now onto what this game be this be the most realistic hunting simulation around the countryside be stunning there be weather and wind condition to take into account and if you make a wrong step in the wrong place the animal will spook you need to take your time and well hunt if you combine this free game with the trailrunner pack you get a 1 year subscription to hunt for every animal lot of gun and bow to be able to hunt everything and plenty of extra equiptment to aid you in your hunt you do not need the microtransaction if you get this pack but they be there if you want them 29 99 for a complete hunting simulator total bargain if you ask me just remember this be a simulator try it download it run through the first few tutorial and hunt a free animal on your guest pass if you grow to like it get the trailrunner pack and you will not need any microtransaction if you take your time and plan carefully,pos
this game be really e fun and addicting and people who say kabam make it pay 2 win either be people who or just suckso get good even if it be hard at first and you will like it trust me but when you die at a high lvl or with good stuff this game make me start cut my wrist so be careful cause i have unistalle it 10 time and i still play so i suggest it to anyone who like this art style with bullet hell and all,pos
if you be not look to play hardcore this be a great game i absolutely love the combat but when you get to high level you realise that you need to spend real cash to enjoy it i spend a lot of time try to make premium cash through farming craft so that i do not have to spend anything on but that do not work out very well i have be play this on and off for year now a good game to pass time the seasonal event be fun and the browser game be cute just do not get too attach,pos
before i start i need to ell you that this should neither have thumb up or down expand the page for the more positive stuff at first i post a negative review because of its stupid free to play mecanic and how they charge crasy amount of money to play more than the bad car that i have not tuche since i buy dtm experience on raceroom raceway and portimao to be able to really enjoy the game just take a track for example a less known and popular track cost 3 and a legendary track like spa and monza cost 5 and the car just to buy 1 car with all paintjob for it it cost 3 to not pay as much i recomend buy one of the experience pack like dtm and adac to get some good car and track apart from that stupid pay system the game be good they update the game regulary and be add new thing now and then the physics be good but not perfict the sound be great the visual be amaze the adaptive ai should mark a milestone in racing sim and be the great feature if you pay for the stuff in game you will get an amazing game,pos
elsword online be a fast pace side scroll dungeon crawler where grinding be the key although you start out as a select character with no real customization you can later find customization through your armor choice your class choice and if you wish to through the store that have item you have to pay for the fast paced game style allow for a quick and fairly painless leveling experience that get you into the end game raid that much faster elsword start you off with a select amount of class that in themselves have their own sub class elsword also allow for a sub class switch if you decide be on the dark side be not your thing the community although have its own few troller and hater be generally really nice from joke be tell into the world chat to guild offer help and invite all day long elsword do support the gaming controller although i would not recommend it with the amount of button smash you will be do to get those perfect combo,pos
people that write negative review about this game say the game do not load simply try solution before give it a bad review also people complain about the dev be greedy because it be a free game and they be put currency in the game and also a pro version the currency in game and pro version support this game to make it a well experince for us player you can not make a free game and not add pack or currency me personally i do not care about it i simply just enjoy the game with my friend and have a good time,pos

i play ps1 for many year and safe to say that even after 4 year ps2 be still an unrefined piece of hot garbage the influence from modern fps be pretty clear give the fast pace but this result in frustratingly short round and plenty of instant death it be well with a squad but even then you be just try to cover up flawed game mechanic with the social environment of a unit ps1 feel like something unique ps2 feel like battlefield with more waiting involve before you get to shoot something on the off chance you do get to shoot something it be usually zerg time by then and you be in a 100v100 messy zergfest that will send your fps tank thanks topoor optimization after four year of refinement if you want a superior fps experience there be well one out right now if you want a superior free to play game there be well one out right now i be kind of amazed that after four year this game still run and play like garbage even on modern rig i should not have to read a youtube guide on tweak an ini file in order to get the game to give me 30 40 fps most of the time edit update do i mention shallow hoo boy ps1 have strategy you know not just tactic and if you know the difference between those two thing then you will understand that strategy in ps2 be nigh impossible all cont all four of them of which usually only 2 be unlock at a time oh lawd be always in a perpetual 3 way meaning unless one empire be get gang bang it be basically a stalemate due to how easy it be to pull galaxy from warpgate and most importantly how easy it be to redeploy you can re mobilize a force from one base and shuttle them across the entire continent in under a minute consider the cap time on basis it result in make it painfully hard to take territory without an army show up within 60 second of the base start to cap we be suppose to be try to win these alert with victory point but i have never see people play who actively pursue vps everyone busy grind achivement directive for their various weapon or kill farm an ams sunderer now guess that be one way to get people to drive that piece of somewhere to pad their oh so important stat thing that should be baseline ams cloak medpack be lock behind hundred or even thousand of cert arguably it be balanced because you can pull a default version of everything air cav tank without need cert but go figure since you can cert into actual performance upgrade for these thing you will be at a disadvantage against someone who have adorable little thing like side armor when you do not good luck the game be and be a mad cash grab the pace be manic compare to ps1 and strategy be nonexistent if you enjoy imaginary treadmill where you farm 1000 kill with 3 4 version of the same gun and listen to neckbeard argue on com which version be the good while whittle away your hour in this garbage be my guest it be a time waster at best,neg

you have to seriously dedicate yourself to this game to thouroughly enjoy it and i honestly think this can be an amazing game at will when you want it to be i personally think this game be great for some and clearly not for other but it have incredible action and satisfying battle that can reach to so many epic proportion and although this be a game that i have probably spend most of my life on unless you be into hour of wierdly enjoyable grinding then you should just play dungeon fighter,pos

allow me to start this review by say that the game in it be basic free to play version be a decent one to say the least with a pretty nice community and enjoyable gameplay why then be i not recommene this game it be common knowledge that these type of game be lean more and more towards p2w but while other game may actually care about you if you spend money not this one not if use your steam wallet to buy the product at any rate i use my steam wallet to buy some currency call zen hope to sell it in game for quick astral diamond which be basically the common currency not only be i not reward the first time buyer pack which be reserve for people who buy directly from arc my account be put on probation mean anything i buy be bind to my account and i be unable to sell zen you would think a day or two while they verify the payment would be understandable but it have be a week and a half and i be still on probation i think fine let try something else so i buy enchanted key which let you open lockbox hope to find a decent item to sell in the auction house the key be also bind but what they fail to mention be even the reward in the lockbox will be bind so for example if you find a mount selling for around 6million astral diamond which you do not like or already have you be stick with it i can almost hear people say dum a of course the reward will be bind your key be also bind but you be wrong vip player and yes i be one get an enchant key everyday which be also bind however the reward open with it be not so to recap i do recommend this game in the free to play mode possibly get vip but do not bother use more money to be treat like a third grade citizen,neg

this game a little over my head in term of detail the control allow you to manage far too many different aspect of the plane for my taste i do finally get the hang of flying but after try and fail to arm and use my weapon for the 30th time i know this game be not the one for me maybe i will try again sometime when i have some hour to memorize the key and their modifier of which there seem to be a couple hundred this be not a game for simple people like me,neg
pro extremely detailed very relax the actual process be exhaustively accurate or at least aspire to be i do not own a gun myself that i can cross check their work with if a give part could not be remove in reality without remove another part the game make you do it in the correct order it also force you to deal with part so small that they do not initially seem to be there even on a close examination plastic mode color all the part differently in bright neon color to make them stand out more useful in these case a competitive element that you can engage or ignore freely each gun have leaderboard you can compare yourself against there be also car and skeleton to disassemble although only a handful of each and a motorcycle and two military vehicle the game include shooting range and challenge to allow you to play with the gun as well as just examine them but it appear that not all gun have corresponding range out of the five i have unlock only two have such level con you start with only three model ak 47 1911 and a human skeleton under bonus model to unlock more gun you have to either save up experience point or spend real world money if you be willing to spend money you unlock gun quite quickly to do it through xp you have to grind that be slow i be seven hour in and have unlock just three additional gun keep in mind that each gun i have encounter so far take no more than ten minute to completely disassemble and re assemble and that be the first time attack a relatively complex gun like the ak the tec 9 clocking in at less than forty part take just five minute total and judge by the leaderboard i be slow what be more gun unlock in a specific order along a tree like a civ v tech tree except that it go in multiple direction you have to unlock eight gun to get to the garand for instance and those eight gun take you in the opposite direction from the desert eagle for another example you can not actually see the whole tree to begin with either you see the next gun available to unlock and you can see vague outline of the one after that with no name or detail after that nothing you have to consult chart make by other player to plan your unlock more than two step ahead there be also a handful of gun that can be unlock only with purchase credit there be often gun beyond these that can only be access by get through that one gun so while they be free you can not get at them without have pay virtually all of the respectable handful of non gun model be pay credit only as well conclusion it be good for kill a few hour here or there but completionist should be aware that it be impossible to 100 percent this title without pay and everyone should be aware that what progress you can make be make only at a comparative crawl,pos

repair cost be way too expensive for exemple you win a game and earn 20 000 sl but you die two time so there be around 12 000 in repair cost so at the end you only get 8 000 sl and it be bad when you loose also the fpe and part that be essential need to be free i play this game since 2014 and they be right now do atmatmatmatmatmatmatmt not listen to the community i hope they will solve it soon but right now i be really disapointed,neg

early access reviewgreat game but partial controller support i do believe the correct term be rush incorrect controller support a be not equipwhats with the spazzy ness when you spam x pre match start wait for the balloon sensitivity be awfulcontroller do not work in any menu other then settingsit just a mess,pos
so let me start this off that i absolutely love this game but it have a lot of issue with it i will explain the pro and con and feature the game currently need below i have be play the game since 2013 and my hour be not correct as i have a pre steam version of the game and only recently switch to a steam version pro the tank combat be outstanding and imo it be far superior then world of tank in many way the selection of tank and airplane be vast and they be constantly add new one into the game currently add french airplane line arcade air combat be a lot of fun as it lift most of the restraint that you would not experience in realistic or simulator you can make turn that would normally rip your wing off the map and all the vehicle be absolutely stunning at max setting and i have no issue run it on either of my pc one have a single gtx 980 and my main pc have 3 980ti gaijin be constantly update the game and patching issue that be report and do rebalance of gameplay there be multiple game mode to choose from range from arcade to simulator and even have event tournament con though the tank airplane be fairly historical look the actual function of the vehicle be not german bf109 and fw focke wolf be absolutely nerfe beyond belief in realistic they do not turn whatso ever and be just shred 90 of the time by every nation now grant if you use stick and paddle you will be able to maneuver alot better and beat most with mouse and keyboard but if you run into someone else use same thing you stand no chance normally the german tank be know for their power at the time and that do do not show in the game many of the tank that germany use be powerful and heavily armoured but in war thunder it seem there be a bias by the developer about them german tank be very slow compare to most tank yes but they be hard to kill from the front and even from the side on some of them but in war thunder i have see tiger i destroy in single shot through the front by light tank there be also a huge issue with the fact that a panther and tiger be unable to penetrate the sloped front of the sherman which be only 2 inch thick and with angle only make it 3 6 inch thick yes the armor be good to stop a panzer 3 but it could easily be penetrate by tiger i and panther huge russian biased for all of their vehicle the tank seem to have twice the armour that be actually list and bounce so many shot its unbelievable i have a russian game where i bounce 13 shot in a row from 4 different tank at different angle and be able to take all 4 of them out without take any major damage the russian air force be vastly out match by the luftwaffe for nearly the entire war but in war thunder once again russian airplane crush every other nation airplane with ease people be able to turn the game setting to the low possible graphic that it give them an advantage over those who play be high detail at the low setting it remove bush at long distance and decrease the foliage on tree and even remove some boulder rock on the map this allow people to shoot from farther distance and be hide to those playing at a high detail and be a very cheap tactic that be be take advantage of for year now only recently have it become so bad that atleast 75 of the time you will be shoot from across the map without see the enemy i have even watch replay on map be people be shoot through the ground and hit people at the bottom of a hill the game have two different currency be silver lion and golden eagles silver lion be earn through get kill hit capture zone etc while golden eagles be buy with real money now yes the game be a free game and have to have some way of earn income the way it be in place in war thunder be fine 90 of the time until you figure out that it give some nation an unfair advantage and screw over other a good example be the russians get a be 6 in tier 4 to those who do not know there be 6 tier now you may think that be not a big issue but it be when you look at the tank it be face which be far inferior to an be 6 what make it bad be the fact that the be 3 be a tier 5 tank now historically the be 6 do be not well then a be 2 or be 3 and very few be 6 be make because of this but once again russian bias make this tank over power another good example be the only german tier 4 tank be the ru 251 can only be buy with golden eagles mean germany do not have a tier 4 light tank to use put it at a huge disadvantage another huge issue be uptiere everytime i play as a german in tier 3 with battle rate 5 7 in realistic i be instantly uptiered to battle rate 6 7 go up in a tier make a huge difference as you will go from fighting be 1s and t34 85 to be 6 be 2 etc which be hard for a tiger to take out due to the bias against german vehicle there be so much more i could go into about con that i be just go to end it where i be at just because i feel the con alone be enough of a sign that the game be break due to a bias against german vehicle and the fact that russian vehicle seem to be the great thing ever make this game brough me alot of fun when i first start play it but now day i get so angry due to be kill by people use low detail to have cheap kill or run into russian super vehicle if you do decide to get into the game i suggest if you be go to play tank to play simulator as it so far its the only game mode anymore worth play imo,neg

after all these year do you guy really think you can keep get away with treat your player like sheep come from someone with unfortunately hundred of dollar into this game have play since 2013 and be a tank airplane nut you can not present your game as one which require player to pay money to grind the rank 5 6 grind be so unbearable at time that people will just quit the game instead of stick around why do they quit because it be ridiculous try to grind a stock vehicle and put up with the repair cost after you get walk over because it be stock that be not a fun grind challenge that be be slap in the face gaijin fix youratmatmatmatmatm,neg

good game if you like create with box there be some combat involve but depend the setting of the world you be in it can be minimal and easy which be not necessarily a bad thing you can easily play this without spend any real money but if you like it i imagine you will probably get to the point where you want to spend a little it be well to do that early in your experience with this game since you will get more for your money early on even if you wait or never spend any of your hard earn fund this be still a good game for its genre and worth play,pos

early access reviewim conflict i love and hate this game at the same time i have play this game at least double the registered steam time since i have mostyl play it on my moble everything about this game be good like really good except for 1 thing the power mana system be this game big flaw it feal like the dev dident want to risk any new change in this area so they take a safe bet and copy the mana system from magic the gathering flat of alos inherit its flaw there be mecanic they have introduce from time to time in order to mitigate this problem but in the end you can not remove the risk only reduce the risk if you as a player can forgive the high impack that the randomness of your power have on every game you play then i can highly recommend this game flaw explain you be go to lose game that you could not impact in any way due to the randomness of the power system this hurt extra much if you hade to pay in game currency to enter forge or draft mode no matter how much time you tweak and tinker your deck to perfection there be still a change that you be power starved example 1there be a risk of get stick on 2 power even if your deck be 1 colored and all your card cost 3 you can still lose the game due to not draw a powercard in 10 consecutive turn example 2 you have a multi colored deck of 2 color let say green and blue then the problem will be influence relate which type of fraction you can spend you power on there be a risk that you only draw green card and only get blue influence the entire game even if you have take extreme measure with the deck building to counter this problem here be just me cye a little etra to get it out of my head sorry me personally can have 4 card out of 75 that cost 8 mana and all other card cost 3 i will still dra all 4 of the 8 cost card as initial hand every game all the time,pos
really fun the first time through buuuuuuut if you decide to make another character and go through with a different class the game get really long and bore it can get really expensive at time too since get a good mount 110 move speed can cost like 30 40 can also be very repetetive and grindy at time since most of the mission be the kill x amount of these thing type of mission pvp can be a completeshow since most of the time you will go against people with like 3 billion gear score and they will fuuuuuuuckkkkkk you up those be all the big con of the game and i be to lazy to list the pro so yeahhhh its really up to you if you want to get this game or not but if those con make u wanna kill yourself then you probably should not get this game,neg
i never write review and i never pay more than a couple buck for a game but this one deserve it addicting like minecraft it be minecraft but it run much well on my old computer and have a lot of feature i want in minecraft only down side be that it be not open source like minecraft so if you want mod and other item you have to purchase dlc but still fun regardless i hope the developer continue to refine the game feature and add more one thing i would really want be an offline mode,pos
not too happy with this game after play the include campaign basically everything cost gold or cash farming gold be kinda slow you need 3 4 daily mission for 1 event ticket and to unlock another campaign or state of the art deck you will need about 20 40 daily there be resource to improve card that be quite grindy to get in addition even if you have all the stuff to improve card you may notice that your level be too low for that and you will have to grind some more the ai deck look pretty rigged to me and the campaign often give advantage to the opponent it suffer from all tcg prob like get wrong card at the wrong time while opponent seem to get just what they need to compensate the ai seem to play bad when you retry a campaign mission so even the dumb will make it at some point so he can purchase the next campaign card pack 6 card cost 2 buck and more often than not contain crap card or card for different school you can not use with your main deck event ticket be 2 buck each and you can fight up to 9 ai opponent for reward but without some special card you will start to loose after 3 5 enemy make this a bit cheap than buy pack but still expensive not a bad game if you want to spend some buck or invest serious time to unlock thing but for casual play it be just to grindy and boring do not dare to start pvp fight and bail out after i finish the include campaign and reach level 9,neg
war thunder be fun for the first few month but then you start see just how break the game be in term of balance and accuracy some tank be so inaccurately model that you be well off play the other tank game instead that one be at least somewhat balanced while wt have some nation which basically serve only as cannon fodder to the nation that gaijin favour countless bug report have be post on the war thunder forum but the dev just do not care they only care about dish out as much new content as they can to attract player at the expense of leave several year old bug still in the game can not recommend,neg

for a free game world of tank be a lot of fun no transaction be really required and there be not a paywall to prevent those who do not pay anything from be competitive occasionally competition can be annoying when your team do not really care or one of the player on your team go mia on you there be also a lot of grinding after a certain tier which can be frustrating when you have have a long lose streak if you do not like ginde by yourself the good way to play this game be to drag in a few friend with you the moment i start learn from my mistake and start grind with friend my gameplay get a lot better and i start enjoy myself more great game for its price,pos

so i agree with some other that the game can become a little repetitive over time and if you do not like grind or spend a lot a lot of time mining then maybe do not play this but overall it be free to play and they be update with new content still and as far as i understand will continue to do so it be a great and pretty alternative to minecraft and there be some really fun stuff to play and do in the game good for multiplayer as well if you want to build together and create your own place,pos

just go to start with say that this be my personal opinion and my experience with the game other will have different experience and opinion of their own i play this game quite a lot when it first come out year ago before steam i buy the god bundle because i like be able to play all the different mythological figure i enjoy different take on a moba style game and love the mythology angle of it unfortunately the longer the game be out the less fun it become it reach esports level and people start dump their life into the game i play mobas very casually and do not take them very seriously at this point the game be almost unplayable in a casual way bot match be a terrible waste of time unless you just want to try out a new god you have never play before the bot be so bad at the game that it do not even give you a good feel of how the god actually play though outside of bot match the majority of the game i join i end up against a clan that clearly play the game a lot while i end up on a team of random with no coordination what so ever the other team will just steam roll through yours and not even be take the game seriously it be not really an enjoybale game when 5 minute into the game your team have 1 2 kill while they be in the double digit they destroy half your tower and be now just farm kill for fun you can not surrender until 10 minute and they be fully aware of that once in a very rare while you will get into a normal game without any clan and it can be pretty enjoyable but those match be far and few between the only way to really enjoy the game be to play it seriously and focus on it as your go to game you pretty much have to find a group of people to play the game with and really only play it with them of course there be go to be player that be good enough to carry a team but for most game it be go to be a matter of the group coordination planning and communication like any moba the real issue i have with the game be that casual play do not exist because their either be not a skill base matchmaking system or it be just a really horrible one i will maybe play this game once a month to try out new god release or try out a new event but it get bad every time i come back i do not know why they think it make sense to put clan up against completely random group in their non ranked play there be plenty of clan in queue why can not they get match together and random group can get match with random group and of course like most mobas the community be pretty toxic you can expect to be insult and trash talk by the clan that just wipe the floor with your team at the end of the match because it be too ez for them i can jump back into hot or lol queue up and typically get into a game with people of similar skill and at least have a chance at win most game i do not have time to focus all my attention of this game and follow the meta to have the perfect build with the right team to run the perfect play against another team on a regular basis if there be a way to conitently queue up and not end up against an organized clan i would probably play this game more and actually be able to enjoy it again tl dr do not bother with this game unless you like incredibly stupid bot match or get steamroll by clan in unranked casual queue if you love mobas and you have an organize well communicate group to go into battle with you then my review do not really apply and you should give it a try if you be look to play it casually then you really should pass on the game,neg

early access reviewthis game confuse me because it be not badly do it be a f2p game but it be mostly pay2avoidgrind there be some p2w element to it but i have not notice them have any significant impact on the game you gain the free currency fast and unlock the gear quickly i be in a tank with a big gun on it by my second night of play the interesting part be that the starter tank with a machine gun be not actually bad infact it be pretty good you be essentially a metal box of anti infantry that can park in any barn you want it work well and you do not feel crap on from above just because you be not shell out money on unlock upgrade quicker with real cash the weapon be heavily customisable and they actually make a difference i have an smg that fire so fast that at least one person have accuse me of hacking because of it wonderful thing since i be such a crap shot you can also steal bicycle and give people backie which be clearly a major selling point the game itself be very basic there be not much to it it be a ww2 shooter which feel to me like day of defeat on battlefield sized map but it be nothing special just a shooter but it have me hook i have no idea why the game be average but the fact that it be a f2p game that do not feel like i be force to pay up to keep up have me smirk as i sit in my little tank gun down anyone that come near the cap point i could use a big tank sure you gain currency just as quickly as you gain unlock but i do not want to because everything in this game from basic gear to big gear have it be place i be still confused as to exactly what it be about this game i like maybe it be just simply because it be hit all the right note for a f2p game that want to include a p2w element but do not feel like a monster grind or keep me down because of it maybe it be because the game be barebones but feel like it have a lot of content to it and will only have more on the way or maybe it be just because i can steal some americans bicycle for the glorious fatherland,pos
model f2p the big downside to the game be its zen system which i suppose be the only way for a free mmo to make money as one would expect from a f2p model unlike in game like path of exile the item purchase with zen can definitely be game altering and offer advantage that free player would not have access to at a much early level however there be a way to convert in game currency astral diamond into zen at a conversion rate that change depend on the market neverwinter sometimes push the player to use special currency in order to open lockbox contain level appropriate equipment but be otherwise not too intrusive unfortunately the in game currency of zen to dollar ratio use an extremely expensive conversion when compare to other f2p game such as rift while most decent item set cost somewhere between 1500 3000 zen approximately 500 zen 5 depend on how many zen be purchase at once gameplay some of the most innovative and fun combat you will find in the current mmo scene the class be very well flesh out but definitely not balance as of yet most class require re position timing and anticipation when react to enemy or even ally action it be definitely not a click and spam blindly game unique mechanic be introduce depend on the class a guardian fighter can hold up a shield to block attack while a rogue can quickly close distance with a teleporting strike every class feel truly unique and full of flavor the combat system be mostly base on a d d type of ruleset with skilltree in the form of feat and eventual specialization while quest be very linear and everything else be pretty much what you would expect in a standard mmo the profession system be more of a que and wait overall i would recommend this game to anyone who be await wildstar and its combat system and want something similar to satisfy their hunger for arpg type combat additionally creative mind can use this game to create scenario type quest and dungeon through a feature i personally have not use much call the foundry multiplayer standard faire for the current mmo market pvp scenario of vary type pit 5v5 co op challenge that can quickly be complete with friend or random player and dungeon lot of variety for all type of player and a guild system most player use the in game chat to find group or member no innovation but definitely satisfy for those who do not like solo 7 5 10,pos

alright lady and gentleman time you tell you a decently okay story review of realm of the mad god now before we begin i would just like to say something this game be perma death but you can keep some of your item if they be in your vault do not be decieve by my measly 30 play hour i probably have 10x this amount before i start play through steam and not the rotmg website prosvery entertainingsimple learn curve if your new to the genrefun community and you make friend quite easilycontrol be simple yet perfecthigh replay valuemany different class to choose from with there own unique item and skillsyou get to run in horde of player you do not even know explore a dungeon and i mean ton of people there be a server specifically for tradingfun play solo or with friendsdepende on how you view it very rewarding but also very punishing perma death extremely fun boss fight i mean legit your fight a giant e puppet that s like hella op with you 50 people and the fight still take a couple minute consmoney all they want be your money basically your bombard with ad and deal everytime you open the game also the hub be legit full of item to buy but cost like 1 15 even though you can easily with the right tool earn them in game do not worry you do not need to buy these item at all spend money in general but one thing i would recommend buy if you enjoy the game be the new player starter pack to sum it up new player have 7 day 1 week to buy this starter pack or you will not get the offer ever again it be definitely worth get it it be 20 but if you be to buy all the item vault chest coin each it would cost you around 80 so it be worth a buy the game be abandon the developer do not update the game anymore so no new content will be add to the game scammer but wait you just say rotmg have a great commu shut up i know what i say and it really do have a great community but everyday more and more scammer come to the game so it get a little hard to trade with someone when your like i will give you 8 defence pot for 1 life pot and they be like nah dude big scam big scam you give me 16 def pot and i will give you 2 mana pot like that gay but overall if you be plan to spend money on this game i do not recommend it but if you be go to f2p this game like it be originally suppose to be sure give this game a quick try,pos
early access reviewignore my hour on steam for this game i have be play realm royale ever since it get into close alpha and i can tell you that this be a fresh breath of air in the oversaturated genre that be battle royale one of the big thing that i applaud realm royale for be its encouragement of more aggressive and meaningful playstyle rather than the camping of pubg and the turtling building of fortnite this be mainly due to realm royale class system you can choose from 5 different class the warrior a tanky bruiser class that be focus on close range fighting and enemy engagement with melee and shotgun the engineer a more supportive class that can build turret and focus mainly on area denial and heal the assassin a high damage class that use deception and invisibility to dish out high amount of damage from either far away or right behind you the mage my personal favorite a class focus on use their ability to impede their enemy progress or to help themselves survive the hunter a class focus on dish out consistent damage while also keep their distance from their enemiesunlike other battle royale there be a class and playstyle for everyone and the variety of playstyle that each class have make fight between them unique and appeal rather than the dull camping of other popular battle royale the gameplay rely heavily on player skill and knowledge of what a class be capable of do the game craft system also counterract the great issue of battle royale games rng instead of have to pray for a good loot drop in crate the game allow you to craft your own legendary item and potion if you have the resource necessary to do so the ability to also call for a mount for quick traversal of the map be also a welcome addition and help to speed up the game significantly the map itself be also visually appealing and provide different biome each with their own flair and touch now while there be so many positive to this game there be also a few negative for one the game be still in alpha so there be some bug that you can expect to find in the game hi rez be do a great job of fix these bug but there be still some bug in the game so be warn the amount of item and ability that you can get in the game be also limited and certain spell and weapon be lock behind class which be to be expect overall though these negative be mainly due to the fact that this game be still in its alpha stage when its fully polished i expect that this game could very easily beat the like of pubg and fortnite due to its fun and refreshing gameplay that be not halt to a screech due to overly defensive gameplay or cut and dry mechanic,pos
let me see we could write for hour how amazing this game be but we do not have time for that it be an awsome simulation air combat game if you want to try it please you must have an open mind a be mindwille to overcome the hard knowledge of each and one of the aircraft from the simple command to the advance one need to put some hour in it need to have proper equipment since track ir5 important need to have a proper joystick overall top game and with the new update arrive soon awsome sim ever make fly safe,pos

early access reviewgreat game i have a blast with it though the tutorial could be short i enjoy the story along the way and it do not bother me that much i like the new mechanic and the style choice of this game if i could change anything i feel at some part it be too fast for me to read what certain card do to see what s go on and i wish there be a play history on the side or a more obvious one because i have not notice one i also feel like the ai could be more challenging i feel like some win be not earn and it be just a stall point to the next opponent one deck do not play a single monster just stick with spell to give them more power until i win i be obviously new to this game but i notice i do level up in the gauntlet so that may change in the future other than that i enjoy this and hope to see it succeed,pos

early access reviewbasically mtg streamline to make it more playable on computer mobile with some unique mechanic to set it apart like in mtg mana screw and flood be a thing but i think some of the people complain make claim that be not bear out by statistic or be discount the positive aspect of that type of not guarantee mana system like make it possible to have more powerful card in the high end that be not to say that they could not have more card design to make it better more draw or card that help fix mana in some way but designer have to take into account positive and negative when balance not just dwell on salient negative outcome which be often self inflicted e g through bad deck building,pos

i be disapointed but the new change do not take away from the fact that this be still a great card game i do not like the new ui look at all so i agree with that everyone be upset at the new change but they do not realize that they be turn away new player who may not care as much about the look i do think that the menu be more confusing but i be sure i will get use to it i hate the fact that now when i log on or look at the game in my steam menu that i see hot elf chick in bikini armor i really hope that the character change often because i do not want to play a game if it be go to be cover in hot chick it be 2018 we be over this stuff and it look like those crappy web ad for the mobile game anyway i hope there be a good reason for change how the board look to be fair i do like the look of the card after some get use to and the player deck on the table be a nice touch and the new border around the player icon with the rune look cool the mana ring now look like crap it look cheap like 2001 graphic and the blank table do not look good how can you go from play on an eld scroll with cool image that change to a blank table with not very good look wood grain the game board feel too squished like there be no distance between the player board i also think the moth need to be fix they look cheap and out of place when those moth be super cool and legendary in es the table look too crowd the soul gem on the table look cheap i do not mean to go on but these thing mean a lot when you be look at them for a long time and try to concentrate on your game i still love the game and do recomend it but the dev need to reach out and let us know that they be not go to let the game be ruin people have spend money and time to unlock card it would break my heart to have to quit playing altogether but it be not at that point yet keep play let the dev know that we care,pos
i go into this game expect great thing have love race 07 as it be my introduction into pc sim racing play the game as a racer its pretty good but compare to the competition assetto corsa project car hell even race 07 it just be not good value for money if you want to buy more car track to buy 3 car and a track cost about 10 if you want to buy every car track and livery you be look at well over 100 and even if this be the good racing game ever make with the good physics graphic and feature it would not be worth that if you want to spend that much on a racing game i would recommend a monthly subscription to iracing or rfactor 2 which will certainly cover you in that regard for a utter beginner into pc sim it be not to bad but for everyone else this will simply drain your wallet with not enough reward not compare to its rival i wish they make gtr 3 instead,neg

there have be many hunting simulator on the pc and in my youth i do remember play a few then they be more ambitious and less refined today thehunter stand as a full experience with graphic to match it be a massively multiplayer online game which be completely free to play it borrow from game like second life but be all about the complete hunting experience this be not like a game you setup on top of your tv and blast buck fly at you in technicolor this be a game which have take strive to create a realistic simulation of a real hunting experience you start by design your character and sign up for another source of lifelong email the game allow you to explore the entire reservation and hunt rabbit and mule deal the be other player to interact with and if you be want to upgrade to the full experience you will have to purchase the proper license beware your steam coin will start jingle so that beg the question be it worth it the game graphic be very up to date and beyond beautiful on the high setting i see a game that completely be devoted to simulate a real hunting experience the sound be crisp with extreme attention to detail animal have real sound branch break with a real crispiness the gun be real with a big verity of gadget and equipment to use on your hunt although the experience be totally immersive the free version be a little more like a demo the limitation of only be able to hunt mule deer and cottontail rabbit really make the free version become old quick there be a lot of expansion and edition but review strictly the free portion it be beautiful but limited if you be look for a genuine hunting simulator i totally recommend it if you be a little bored and look for a consistent long last free experience you may have to look elsewhere,pos

hi again everyone happy steam sale it be time for another review war thunder be another entry in the ww2 battlefest category and it be a vehicular version of fps gameplay feature player operable plane and some tank that be sure to satisfy some fan of the genre i have not have the opportunity to sample everything the game have to offer but i have sample it enough to give a good basic review and endorsement base upon the fun hour i have spend in the game so what be the particular pick a major player from ww2 axis or ally grab a plane and fight or alternatively grab either a russian or german armored ground unit and go to work at the present it appear that ground and air game be completely separate with the alternate form of fighting handle by ai in either game you get some very basic gear to start off with at tier 1 and work your way up the ladder your achievement in game translate into research point for upgrade as you go your upgrade increase your ability to survive and achieve more as you play you easily earn enough unless thing change to purchase well plane and gear without spend real cash there be an arcade mode a realistic mode and a simulator mode i have spend nearly all of my time in arcade and that be plenty of fun i will leave the review of realistic and sim mode to someone with much more experience with those therefore please assume my comment be mostly base upon my experience with arcade the good a lot there be a lot to like about this game even if it be a bit f2p mmo ey for some what it do right be astoundingly good i think it be beautiful play on three monitor surround if you can add joystick and throttle if you like gamepad anyone or just wing it with a single monitor and mouse the developer aim to give you many option with this one and it fulfill many of my gaming sim desire involve plane ww2 and lovely landscape there be an arcade mode a realistic mode and a simulator mode i have play many game that attempt to straddle the line between simulator and arcade game and as a result i have log numerous hour attempt to keep my plane under control while try to find and engage a distant speck in the sky in war thunders arcade mode you get some level of realism mix with ton of action action action freedom of choice and strong competition make this game a winner with a large selection of aircraft most of which you must earn or into which you may pay your way a vibrant at this time player community on pc and ps4 make wait time for battle very low the matchmaking be somewhat good because you get place into a group base upon your skill and gear the pay 2 win aspect be somewhat mitigate by this because while you can pay your way ahead you can only pay your way so far beyond your peer before you place yourself in a completely different rank of competition skill and brain be requrie regardless of your gear and this be a good thing because iron sharpen iron as they say the bad i find there be a serious lack of balance in the game not everyone will agree of course but if you play the start plane of all nation you can feel the difference some will argue that this reflect the reality of vary level of tech at the start of the war but i disagree the soviet aircraft and tank always feel op both on the giving and on the receiving end i can not tell you how many aircraft i have be shoot down in by player in soviet plane i once fly a large bomber which have its tail sever with one blow from a soviet biplane rocket maybe one shot lucky hmmm i be not sure i have have wing cut off by soviet fighter like they be make of brittle paper in this game for maneuverability it be hard to beat the soviet biplane for sheer 55kickery it be hard to beat their fighter which appear to destroy anything that get too close to their sight in tank game which only allow german and russian vehicle at this time the russian tank feel somehow tough to me the tank gun sight turn color depend on how likely your round be to pierce enemy armor at the point of aim green for good chance of damage yellow for middling and red for low chance at damage compare tank for tank i have have trouble damage opponent while use german tank and a green crosshair while at the same time destroy opponent in one shot use a russian tank with a red crosshair if you fly british or japanese begin fighter and the russian begin fighter on the same day for the first time after you be experience with the mechanic of the game just as i do before write this review you can feel the difference in the aircraft for each nation the russian aircraft feel well be more maneuverable and i score more hit kill and assist with those than i do with any other nation aircraft at that time for that level crew be completely new and all other element somewhat equal gaijin be russian i suppose that say all that need to be say and i have have issue with gaijin over their moderation in other game in the past take it for what it be worth it be one informed opinion you be entitled to your own which i hope you will develop on your own by play this game regardless some may claim that the russian aircraft be just that good but i offer you this quote from wikipedia by 1938 the soviet union have the large air force in the world but soviet aeronautical design be distinctly lag behind western technological advance instead of focus on develop tactical aircraft the soviets engineer develop heavy bomber plane only good for long distancein other word plane that would be use for record break flight like those of chkalovs the soviet government focus on showy stunt and phenomenal record breaking mission drain resource need for soviet defense when nazi germany attack the soviet union in june1941 it quickly become apparent that the soviet air force be not prepare for war june 20 2014 the ugly i only have two complaint and then i will move on first do not make any statement in chat that anyone may find remotely disagreeable because the community have a good number of loudmouth jerk troll even if you say nothing chance be good that you will read something hilariously asinine while play if you play for a bit a few idiot like to tk and in that respect it be no different from any fps second you be go to get botte just accept that fact quietly and move on when it happen try to open the scoreboard click the name of the person who do it and report them for botte it be make inconvenient on purpose so few people will file complaint especially false one in my experience if you say anything about it in chat you will catch flak from some jerk seriously if someone get lucky that be not an issue for me if someone be shoot at me for any length of time and they hit my pilot that in general be fine but here my experience of what be happen for your consideration scenario 1 i be fly along i hear br less than a second of gun sound and my pilot be knock unconscious on replay i watch a guy fly into position shoot a couple of round if that and fly away immediately after all of that add up to bot in my mind scenario 2 i be fly along in a bomber same thing happen one guy simply turn off my engine just that fast without any apparent damage otherwise most often however my pilot be just knock out my thing be this if they shoot me through my plane would not the round have hit something on the way in thus do damage to the plane as well as knock my pilot unconscious a few scenario present themselves say that it could happen otherwise but i find it happen all too often,pos
good gameplay idea inexplicable business model i understand the need to make money but the free to play pay to win experience base model just do not mesh with the game itself it make far more sense as a nice relaxing sim than anything that pretend to be competitive i do not want to compete or level up or connect to a server i just want to disassemble some gun to be fair it do a good job of that as far as i can tell but i do not want to mess around level up and try to gain achievement to unlock more gun drop the price and give us a sandbox mode,neg

early access reviewfrom what i have play while not a heap i can definatly say that yes it be in development but even so still provide a challenging gameplay mechanic that be not really see in game these day control these massive ship be difficult and yet somehow simple while use the weapon be a breeze and take influence from third person shooter aim then click and on top of manage everything make a stratagy to win the match i would really like to see this game flesh out more in the future which i be sure be come but for now the gameplay be solid with a surprisingly good tutorial and the o k system be awesome i would like to see the control page be dynamic with change in your keybind but that s just me and the menu be well lay out and present neatly and for an early access game that s all you need server be alright i would like to see more reigon in the server list but i be australian so apparently i do not matter xdgraphic be good but sometimes lock up in highly demanding moment like their hyper jump or what ever they be call it basically a great space opera with pretty good gameplay and decent yet to improve graphic tldr its really good you should buy it its like star citizen but real,pos

disclaimer just because the hugethumb above point up do not mean i fully endorse this game i have play world of tank world of warplane world of warship and world of tank blitz and wot be my favorite out of them all a cool fast paced game great for a quick arcade style game of action this come from a dedicated war thunder player though wot may not be the mose realistic game it be definetley very fun no war thunder be not all that realistic either but it have a more relistic feel to it while most people do not consider hp bar and health point realistic it give wot predictable gameplay i stop play wot after a few month as i play the majority of my game on a crappy toaster so it could barley run even the most simple game about a year after war gaming come out with world of tank blitz at this time war gaming have a fairly bad reputation because of war thunder i decide to try it out it be awesome wg keep pump out interesting and stable update keep the game alive although it have the extreme p2p feel and grind it be still load of fun i still play wotb mobile today and the release of wotb on steam be pretty cool while steam be not the ideal place to put a mobile base game on it do prove quite good i expect my toaster to not be able to run it even on minimum graphic but it prove very smooth and playable after all they probably just do a copy paste of the game engine from a phone to a pc though i do find a few flaw frame rate may be good but it be very unstable control have not fully adapt from mobile to pc mouse sensitivity be very sluggish even when bring it up if you be familiar with mouse acceleration this be exactly the problem for those who do not know mouse acceleration be the speed at which your cursor move dependent on how fast you physically move your mouse for example if you physically move use slowly the cursor will move slowly and if you move your mouse fast your cursor will move fast and for a fast pace game like wotb where multiple swipe movement be require to keep up with your aim this make aim very hard as it be very slow and unpredictable another problame i find be when launch the game the game have not be out on steam long so there be bind to be bug specifically game launch bug every time i launch the game via steam it say it need to do the first time launch stuff with the window bla bla bla step 1 4908134 or some crazy thing like that it be really just 3 step it take the game over half an hour to complete 2 step and take another 20 min to finish and launch the game this do this every time i be actually wait for the game to load and decide to write this longreview it almost an hour for it to boot up for the second time in fact in the middle of writing this paragraph the game decide to load up and interrupt me mid sentence other than that wotb pc be exactly the same as the mobile version i like it but that be just my opinion p s thank for read this essay of a review,pos

be play this game a number of year so i speak with experience of yesterday and today prior to this review i check the number of positive review just over 50k and the number of negative just over 39k i find myself in the middle but for the purpose of steam i have tick no first of all please ignore the image on show i do not think any player get graphic like that i have a pretty top rig with decent fps and graphic on high and its nothing like the image above clearly they have have the kim kardashian effect of have be gloss the only good thing about this game be that its a game that still have a lot of potential yet the potential be never really realise the dev make far to many judgement error when develop this game and i will list a number of them below as a free game i do appreciate that development must be slow due to revenue stream be tight but still i expect a certain bare minimal to let that stand but now thing be really sloppy 1 give the people community what they wantdid you know that lmgs do not have bipod yep that right all those movie and documentary you have see be the germans mount mgs on the ground or on concrete sandbag bunker be all fake well accord to h gs there be even though they be draw on the weapon you can not use them virtually every ww2 game i have ever play apart from the very early medal of honor and call of duty game from the early 2000 have deployable bipod i think day of defeat may have be the first and that be a mod for the original half life which give you some idea of how long they have be use on forum all i see be give me bipod give me certain plane and yet the dev say not currently plan when cod ww2 come out all mgs be mountable so how come the dev of cod include it even though mgs do not really play a huge part be as mgs in h gs do make no sense and especially hafter 3 4 year of ask too 2 dev do not know their history sometimes there be a wide variety of weapon and vehicle in this game and for the most part they actually do look great but one of the most laughable thing be when they introduce plane that never even feature in ww2 on the general map you can attack switzerland hang on be they not nutural in ww2 russia can attack usa and vice versa could have swear they be ally 3 a cheater hacker paradisei never quite understand the need to hack cheat use macros etc in mmos because ultimately it can kill of the the genuine player base in spite of the dev good effort this game be a hack fest and it have become quiet the joke especially when you see some of the video on youtube recently i get headshot snipe by a pistol the other player be on the other side of the map this after the introduction of a major update which include new anti hack software but like anything go for the low bidder and you will get what you have pay for 4 very angry player basecompare to a few year ago abuse have become aweful and this have nothing to do with bad player although it be the individual player commit the abuse its the way the dev have allow player to play there be really no way to learn this game any more except the hard way compare to year ago when there be a basic training map and a basic skirmish map now any player of any rank and experience can play any map and in a lot case that s not fair for the new player and also not fair for the experienced player in the basic map that be suppose to be design for novice player its far too common now to come across player with high end gear flip the coin and you have similar issue play a general war game and find yourself under the command of a player who be lvl 4 and your lvl 15 it simply make no sense with this in mind you see a lot of abuse in game due to player with a lack of experience not play as a team a simple solution would be to add restriction to the game play option i still have hope for this game and always like to return every now and then to see where the game be but its painful sometimes to see its current state,neg

alright so i have play a little bit of this game and what i find most about it be that it be repetitive very repetetive will i keep play probably but i can not give this game a good review as much as i be sure all of you would like this to be a good review now when i say it be repetitive i mean that the storyline be practically the same for all character i will admit the gameplay be slightly different for some character and the job change offer a small bit of interest for all of five minute but overall the gameplay become repetitive the quest be just meh and quite frankly the pay to have op stuff tactic ispoor design tldr the gameplay be repetitive the quest be repetitive the character do not feel different enough and do not get me start on the in game real money shop i appreciate that the dev put a lot of time into this but quite frankly i do not care for it this game rate at 3 2 10 from me and even that i feel be too generous,neg

simply put i do not have such love hate relationship with any other game than i have with war thunder also no other game have make me more salty than war thunder that say i will list some pro and con pro different level of realism from shooty tooty arcade to much slower pace simulator battle lot of tank and airplane to unlock and new one be constantly add very nice graphic free to play but not win to pay do actually require some skill especially later in gamecon realism be sometimes more like realism tank ricochet round in very weird way or take damage when they really should not etc there be lot of stuff to unlock but sometimes you will notice that vehicle be very similiar for example when unlock american tank you will spend age grind through three different shermans that be not actually that different from each other after all slight change to armour thickness etc do not really mean anything and that be just one example technically it be still pay to win war thunder have this premium system that give you different kind of booster to use and also provide you with a selection of premium vehicle not all of them be that special but some of them be seriously unbalanced and overpowered do require skill but still most of the time it seem that it be not enough game suffer from serious balancing problem and therefore some match end in minute no matter how good of an player you be some other thing that need to be note game have this battle rating system or br in short this mean that every vehicle have a rating for example 3 7 game then search for player with same br thing be that usually you have more than just one vehicle let say you have three tank with br of 3 7 thing be good and you be have pretty evenly balanced game then you get a tank with br of 4 3 suddenly you be face tank that have br of 5 or even higher this lead to greatly unbalanced game also because of this game do not always feel rewarding for example i grind for some time to get legendary tiger and panther tank but after i get them i really do not feel like play with them because i be fight more advanced prototype or post ww2 era tank most of the time that also take away some realism spawncampe yes i do it sometimes myself too but still too often i see game where one team steamroll to other team spawn and kill everyone some map even make it very easy by have the spawn point on open ground and easily see from across the map already unbalnace game become even more unbalnced because of this lack of teamwork it be extremely rare to see some real teamwork in wt unless you be play with friend or be part of some clan there be lot of russian player even on eu server and they do not usually speak english and even less usually they give a about other player not say that they all be like that just like 80 of them game mode do not really force you to be a team player okay maybe it be bit wrong to rant about this but i still want to point it out with tank game mode usually require player to capture and hold some point on the map even though you do get a reward for capture a point and you do get more point and currency if you win a match it do not force you to play the objective or be a team player wt would be a lot more fun with new game mode etc maybe there will be some in the future all in all war thunder be somewhat hook even though sometimes it make you really salty you may like it or not or perhaps you will be like me and feel both way i choose not to recommend this game because right now it feel unbalanced and break maybe i will change my mind after a while or maybe not,neg

early access reviewlove the game the game be still okay although if they keep in the direction they be go then i will probably drop it the late patch be a huge step backwards towards every other battle royal game they take out the crafting of legendary weapon which be in every promo video on this page terrible decision if you want to make them harder increase the difficultly in other way do something else like one of these create legendary forge you have to use to get the weapon make it cost multiple golden chicken to craft the weapon make it cost more shardsmake it time base or base on the number of player leave when you can create a legendary weapon also i hate that you can get legendary weapon from chest it take the system before that be semi base on skill and turn it into just another battle royale rng fest also not a huge fan of the hit scan weapon do not feel very fantasy and increase the chance of die to someone without any counter play,neg

this game be just rubbish because of the update i remember when this game use to be about skill and less money grab pile ofthis game have potential to be well than many fps shooter today but it be free to play nature kick in every aspect of the game be design to get you frustrated and make you buy the super expensive gold actually to become a tanker now you need to spend 168 hour in game to become a tanker and then you start out with a tank only to get mow down by tiger and shermans this game be not even worth 1 minute of your life unfortunately i have to find this out the hard way trust me do not get this game the picture be nothing but mislead do not make the same mistake i and countless other individual make and just stay away from this game,neg
gaijin be possibly the most out of touch developer the gaming industry have ever see for instance this be just one example of their poor decision make they allow you to buy premium vehicle which decrease the grind by alot but they periodically decide that people be make too much progress and nerf the gain of the vehicle now you have pay for something explicitly to help you grind and it be literally the same as a vehicle you can get for free or sometimes bad if you be into multi thousand hour grind and a company steal your money when they feel like you be progress too fast this be the game for you,neg

this be a game that over reach on just about every aspect and then fall flat on its face recently i be persuade to install this game and play online with my son however during the two and a half hour stream throughout the game despite the fact that i do enjoy play with my son i voice just how disappointed i be with this game from the narrative to the gameplay to the visual it look more like a poor mans dayz which be say a lot as that game by itself be very poorly optimize but be still an awesome game narrative what narrative i have come across some very basic game in the past and each and every single one of them have some form of narrative even if it be just an explanation of the game this one have nothing the game be base on a post apocalyptic world that be now overrun by zombie that be about as far as the narrative go yet as you will read on the game have a lot of potential but because of the lack of attention to detail well if the narrative be anything to go by do not expect much else visual the game as a whole have some element that you can see in other game most notably the arma dayz game the problem be you get the distinct impression that the development team just do not give aone of the big problem i have with the visual be the draw distance some of you may know the spec of my streaming gaming pc that i use as i regularly stream other game at maximum graphical setting so you get the good stream possible to watch despite the fact my pc be more than capable this game be just terribly optimise the draw distance in this game be ridiculous you get the high quality texture for about 10 foot in front of your character then you get the low quality texture after that and combine with the poor texture optimisation that same 10 foot be where you get all the game asset in visual range anything beyond this some of the asset simply disappear this problem can be see on any map in any server at any time another issue be the poor quality of the well quality texture and the model use in the game the building for the most part can not be enter which be unusual for a game that be base on survival instead we get a box with a texture for the building you can enter they be very empty with no furniture chair kitchen not even rubbish just the odd pick up every now and then the model and animation use for the zombie and even your character be very sub par the zombie animation look more comical than scary as they tend to bounce towards you with both hand in the air your character model be also something not to be admire in first person mode the hand some time do not match up with the weapon you be hold certain wearable item you can collect be laughable as depend on what character you have select create there hair jacket will show through the item you pick up another part thatme off be the map themselves as there be very little attention to detail put into the map the more prominent problem be the amount of asset that be leave suspend in mid air grass rock some tree vehicle and i even see a building or two that be above the ground you get the distinct impression that the developer take no pride in create the game as a whole and rush it overall it look like it be create with an old unity game engine use stock asset with such obvious laziness in the visual side of the game it be hard to find anything good to say about it if it be design use an old game engine there be no excuse for the ingvisual you have to take into consideration that this game be less than 2 year old and look as though some dude in his mom basement make this game in his spare time but i suspect there be more to this and that be reveal in the gameplay gameplay poor when you first start the game there be a basic character creation tool that be very limited in option and that be for a very good reason if you want something different you have to pay yes the game game have micro transaction and be completely litter with them yes it be a free game to play but if you want to win you have to pay so not only be it full of unnecessary micro transaction it be a pay to win system which put it in the same category ofgame along with battlefront ii when you play the survivor mode you select create your character and when you join a server you have to go around and hunt for pickup from a large backpack that can hold more item to armour weapon food drink bandage among other useless item that have no bearing on the game so not bad but when you take into account that other people have simply pay for a backpack sniper armour and other stuff before they even enter the map it take the fun out of it instantly as it be no longer an even playing field what be bad be the fact that when you die instead of re spawn back on the same map you be kick out of the server and take back to the lobby and guess what your character can not be revive for about 10 minute force you to create another character and this be directly link to the micro transaction side as those that do spend when they inevitably get kill they can not take all them item for that character and transfer them onto the other so if you do want that awesome sniper armour or backpack before you jump back into the game you will have to buy them all over again be you see a pattern yet when you be in game it be e annoying as hell with the server be very light on population and the map be as big as they be you can run for an hour and not meet or see anyone the same can be say about item for you to pick up and those that have pay for weapon in advance will simply sit there and snipe you before you even pick up a thing after an hour of roam around as i say early pay to win the size of the map be of course one problem but another be the vehicle yes they can make roam around faster but when a troop transporter tank can get hang up on a chain link fence or be knock back by a zombie it be ultimately a waste of an asset that do not work as it should something that be very laughable be the hit box on the zombie themselves you can shoot next to there head and it will register as a head shoot yet sometimes if you shoot them dead in the chest it will not register a hit at all and this i do not understand in the slight i come across a sort of super zombie that be double the size of all the other npc faster than you and apparently unkillable i stand on top of a tank where it could not hit me and i empty all my ammo into its head and it would not die i do not see the point of it and it take all what be leave of the fun this game have if any and pour it down the drain it stop the game dead for me and i be leave expose unable to move or do anything without be kill and have to start all over again conclusion the game look as though it be rush with the bad possible game engine but cram full of micro transaction to cash in on the zombie craze that be come back and the battle royal craze that have hit many other game it be a game design for one reason and one reason only get

game be very clearly pay to win while indeed all non cosmetic can be obtain freely the gain for its currency be a single weapon once every twelve hour of play if you maintain the same pace of the number 1 stat earning player in the game this do not include the price you have to pay for class and vehicle to make them competitive all of which be two to three time more expensive pay player get significant resource advantage that allow them to pull vehicle much more often player be occasionally suspend for achieve score that get deem too high by an automate system all while legitimate hacker take day to week to ban due to a worthless reporting system that need to be circumvent by on website support ticket and reddit thread mandatory item for some class be lock behind very expensive loot box and a tedious alert system that require your faction to win repeatedly to level up which perhaps maybe 10 20 player on a give server have any real impact on which faction actually win failure to have say item can mean the difference between a 1 2 kd and a 6 0 kdthe hit detection in the game be client base so a particularly laggy individual have an extreme advantage if they play aggressively often get second of time before you can even see them to shoot at you individual that use way to artifically limit their ping or even just pull the plug on their connection can increase that time to almost half a minute before server will bother automatically log them off the development team actively desparage critizism of balance change unless it be overwhelmingly positive and have be catch on live stream suspend player for kill them while they casually play the game litterally the only thing that i can see that keep this game afloat be that there be no other true mmo fps on the market,neg

note most of my experience come from play on the browser version of this game realm of the mad god rotmg be a player versue environment bullet hell shooter experience combine with loot galore infuse with an retro 8 bit art style there be emphasis on group role but not enforce upon player who like the lone wolf playstyle the game jumpstart after a stress free tutorial be free to roam the realm that you have be spawn into you survey the beach like enviroment be attack by your first few encounter as a wizard you strike back perhaps even spellbomb complete your first quest then adventure on inland the quest for level 20 begin which may take some time it probably will not be long until the death screen greet you be kill by say reason then one be probably grip onto the fully realise experience of perma death within the game and perhaps either hook to the progression that one can achieve or straight out quit only to perhaps return later at another date it be this continous cycle of life and death that cause the game to be extremely replayable to the point of stagnation for some gameplay be fairly straight forward core control be wasd key for movement spacebar for ability and right click to shoot a simple glance at the setting can further tweak these control as well as realise other crucial binding like the nexus key a key to return yourself to safety from critical moment like the nature of most bullt hell shooter dodge be see crucial as to keep your hp bar healthy have it drop below 0 would equate to the death of that character no respawn of that now deceased character of course your character can shoot back projectile towards specified enemy include melee character relative to actually range character make new entry player have to worry not of control but fixate on the more interesting aspect of the game itself the active gameplay and dance around projectile class fit the usual archetype from mmorpgs such as tank healer and damage dealer they can be sperate into weapon class then further into unique ability which bring about a unique style of combat to each character each have their own strength and weakness feature 8 stat value that can be upgrade to a max value that be different for each character class x 8 maxe be one of the game objective cause your character to become strong 8 8 at first be unmaxed can be consider play legendary to be maxe bring it down to herioc then have a maxed out divine pet a goal for some make the game normal easy difficulty rotmg try to intice its player into a difficult but appealing nature of diffuculty reward those who continue to stay and overcome the challenge and obstacle of the game upon reach level 20 fame collecting become another game objective attempt to pin the tale of that character onto the competitive leaderboard a numerical value to illustrate the lifespan of your character it derive from complete quest achievement and just play the game the game feature peer to peer trade the many dungeoun that drop from certain creature realm event that spawn in order to allow the encounter of face the iconic face of the game these method allow for progression in term of gear as well as stat increase potion which also lead to be use as trading currency apart from untiered gear which be soulbound and so can not be trade base on supply and demand this style of currency make the game fairly integrate into loot grinding of valuable item that other player may want to trade for microtransaction be evident only serve as a method to perhaps skip through the farming part of rotmg only to bring dissatisfaction in addition to the risk of perma death fortunately these be not completely force upon gameplay wise only advertise skill be see more of a determine factor in the game only really restriction be perhaps have limited character and vault storage slot for the non buyer for those who seek for a story drive game rotmg will feel lack its loosely overlapping story be somewhat for the interpretation of the player it will be the gameplay which entice the player the focus on action with unique encounter require player to figure out and pattern recognise the many attack phase of the encounter conquer such will yield respectable reward the style of realm be blocky and cool and should appeal to those who love the retro theme world be split into numerous realm all connect to a nexus point these realm could house up to 85 player with no requiriment of set up need party although guild do exist experience be grant to all nearby player quality loot be soulbound when it do drop only see by player player be generally grind for their own gain of wealth of some sort but naturally player work together to take down tough quest realm present different region that represent level of difficulty head inland to godland be the most dangerous this co operative nature of the game allow for each and every chacter to shine contribute to the main group allow for synergy even the rogue class its ability to rush through dungeoun to the boss can be invaluable to the group the game can be frustrating annoying and depressing after each and every death especially after x amount of time invest into a character yet dance in the realm of the mad god can be fun just the nature and intense gameplay dynamic of have to constantly dodge and shoot that sense of exhilarating action pack into several pixel lootbag of dropping of various quality to provide that incentive to continue for more co operate with other player without the hassle of set up party through each death take each and every bit of experience to the next reborn character only to perhaps beat the record of your previous attempt i can recall several early positive memory be naive to the gameplay especially at the start where the game world would be so vast but commit time to understand it have friend to tag along with can make the journey incredibly endure the journey grind to the end goal of the game could be say the good part of the game experience as the close to end game the less fun it can be have already experience everything already by then regardless i have to sometimes ask myself how death could be

tldr my non recommendation have nothing to do with card acquisition or purchase but purely mechanic this be from both beta play and a little bit after launch as confirmation i want to like tes legend i really do not just because it be base in one of my favourite game world but because it have some really cool mechanic but some other core mechanic be absolute game breaker for me the good the elder scroll no seriously they have do great job of encapsulate the world and race into the card argonian have aggressive majika ramp nords rapidly turn into a hoard khajit get strong by steal from their opponent dunmar always get the last laugh even in death have play te since arena i be surprised how much this game capture the spirit of tamrial lane they add an interesting strategic layer to the game where you summon your creature matter just as much as what you summon do you throw a powerful creature into a crowded lane to thin the enemy rank or into a deserted lane where they have a clear shot at the enemy player match effect this type of game always gravitate towards fix meta have effect that throw a spanner in the work be a great idea it keep everyone on their toe the bad start hand size no i be not kid maybe this be not an issue for many but for someone unlucky like me this be a game breaker i play mtg and even with seven card i often struggle to get a balanced starting hand but at only three stare card i too often find myself wait to turn 3 4 before i can do anything meanwhile my opponent be already get creature on the field and deal damage often with snowball creature yes yes yes deck composition be important but the simple fact remain that with card range from 0 majika to 7 8 majika it be still too easy to get a starting set of 4 6 majika card discard your high and still have 3 4 cost card it be really really bad because it just so often leave the game down to luck of initial draw draw your really good low cost card you have get a strong chance get deluge with high cost card and you may as well give up before you even play a turn so with this in mind no no i do not recommend the elder scroll legend i want to but with entire game hinge on a 3 card draw i can not,neg
i love this game mandatory disclaimer i have be play this game prior to its steam launch in open beta and on the bethesda launcher so i be not new to the game however i have decide to stick with this game for various reason the main one be that it do a lot of thing better gameplay wise than it be old and much big cousin hearthstone the gameplay be fantastic and demand a lot more strategy and planning whilst reduce the rng to much low level i always feel after a game that i could pinpoint exactly where my deck choice deckbuilding or play ultimately lead to defeat or victory and hence enjoy this game a lot more competitively as there be just far few occasion where one big rng swing lead me to lose and often tilt for a while the prophecy mechanic and reduction in rng mean the meta be a lot more balanced with aggro actually not be very strong currently again unlike for tesls cousin hearthstone overall the meta be very balanced with various deck archetype be viable which make the game alwasy very interesting as drawback i would definitely quote the aesthetic of the game the premium be often not very impressive compare to what we know from other game notably gwent be do this very well but the big thing be the gameboard which really ought to be at the top of bethesdas direwolfs priority list as it be just the same grey scroll background whether you be in the main menu or in every single game overall i really love this game and be look forward to the competitive scene that will emerge and make use of the fantastic and skill testing gameplay,pos
early access review note pay no attention to the time as i get this game when it be on indiedb and get pretty far before let it collect dust while pursue other game and the fact i get as far as worth proceed in version 1 2 now for the review i be not really a person who could judge what be consider cute i guess the cardboard cutout be a bit amusing that say those same cutout be make me jump more than once when they appear after just barely escape an enemy that do not need to follow the path to catch you so in that regard i guess you could call them scary too i also like that it seem that the dev stop throw a cutout at you every other room like how they be in the indiedb version i play but outside of those enemy the actual enemy be terrifying and will definitely get your heart race on top of that if it be your first time play they can catch you off guard as there be no rhyme or reason for some of their appearance what i mean be that unlike other horror game good one that be there be a build up to an enemy appearance and on some occasion the rule to win against say enemy be lay out take for example the first resident evil the first zombie encounter be build up use sound effect to create an uneasy feeling of not know what be in the room with you follow up on that the rule for win be lay out as if you try to fight the first zombie a you will notice you use up almost all your ammo and b that you will take damage whereas avoid it you will notice thing like you be fast and more agile than the zombie well agile while use tank control so evasion be a preferred option when you can that be not to say that how the enemy appear in sphj be bad in fact the opposite the fact you do not know when you will encounter a type of enemy or how to beat it without try a few time against a new enemy add it be own eeriness as you do not know what the next room hold for you you have to constantly think on the fly and adapt even quicker however this bring up an issue i have with the game there be way too much luck involve i will give a good example the first enemy you meet be pretty easy to figure out just run but that strategy will bite you in the rear when you come to the first catwalk room that be what i call it at least the room with the narrow walkway that split in multiple direction if you just dead sprint you have a 50 50 chance of take the wrong path and get corner and that enemy take you out in 3 hit there be other point like this as there be an enemy i see in markipliers playthrough i have yet to encounter that seem to appear at random with no way to figure out what you do wrong or right in my case as again i have not encounter the red face enemy in any of my playthrough so like i say this game take alot of luck if you be go to get far or just alot of patience till you get that lucky run the other issue i have i be not sure if it be an aesthetic choice to encourage player to keep calm or if it be just how the game happen to be make the issue be that you have to press forward every time you enter a room what i mean be that you can not just hold down the w key and keep move as soon as you enter the next room no in each room you have to release the key and press it again to move this be really annoying against the aforementioned first enemy as if you forget this you will not move and take damage till you remember to release the forward key and press it again like i say i be not sure if it be intentional or not if it be not then i hope the dev will work on this as it be basically a cheap beginner trap but other than those two issue i do really think this be a good horror game and can not wait to see what the full release be like,pos
tf2 update have make the matching and find a game bit better but it seriously need to reduce the minimum number of people need to create a server small team will help in fast match,pos

  no this game do not use redshell accord to the original reddit post where everyone be get the list of infected game from this game be a false positive anyways back to the actual review a decent idle clicker game with a lot of depth i would recommend it to those who like this kind of game i do enjoy the fact that there be no music or annoying sound as with any idle game ever you get real tired of the same music and sound effect after a few hour lol,pos

early access reviewi also play on an ipad ios and android without steam so you can multiply my hour by 3 this game be very generous with free to play it give 5 decent deck to new player and about 10 pack per week and it will scratch your itch for ccgs quite nicely if you prefer your match to play long mtg then this be not for you i play like 3000 hour of hearthstone on 3 platform and the only disadvantage to eternal over hearthstone be premium card art animation be not as cool the upside be you should just always destroy your premium for the craft ingredient game use traditional random draw mana they provide plenty of dual land but even so you can get mana screwed or mana flood quite easily this be the absolute bad way to lose for new player there be as of jul 2018 a new expansion and we be kind of get into this be hard for new player territory we be not there yet but the next expansion will put us there at some point they will have to develop a standard format to support new player my current plan be to play the heck out of this game until artifact come out then jump ship this game be still 100 playable for new player as of nov 2018 you will just have to get advice on which deck to build and which card to destroy craft but like i say about 10 pack per wee outright give to you plus what you can buy with gold i e forge or draft or league which give you more pack,pos
early access reviewfracture space in it be current alpha state play well polish the development team be good at keep the news current and feature be add tweak in response to feedback from the community be there some good old alpha antic yes but they seem to be few and far between overall my only issue with the game be low player count lead to occasional long matchmaking wait time i expect that this title will continue to grow and when it be release in its mature state it will be phenominal as far as gameplay the control be pretty smooth and intuitive the battle can be intense at time your success be largely dependent on your ability to think strategically and respond tactically it focus on teamwork the leroy jenkins will fare poorly good luck and good hunting,pos
early access reviewi think the game be bad before sheesh i mean when i first play it a year or two ago it be playable now unless you like get spawn kill by tank light machine gun etc it be maddening to even attempt to play i would assume that it be fine if you pay for all the good weapon vehicle and what not but from the sole experience i have have right out of the gate i would not spend a dime on this heap of garbage if my life depend on it spend your cash on red orchestra if you want a decent ww2 shooter experience if you want a bad time you would probably be well off inject yourself with malaria then pour money into this let alone spend your precious time with it,neg

planetside 2 may seem like an amazing game at the start but as you keep play more and more you will notice the high amount of problem this game have and how bad it be in planetside 2 you have three faction the oppressive and communist like terran republic the freedom fight new conglomerate and the technology worship vanu sovereignty each side have different weapon one different air vehicle and one different main battle tank rest of the vehicle be common pool share vehicle terran republic be know for it be fast fire rate low recoil first shot multiplier and large amount of ammo per magazine however their weapon be a bit hard to control during medium to long range fight because of their high fire rate the terran republic main battle tank be the prowler it be equip with a dual cannon make it the good main battle tank for anti infantry combat it be also the fast tank in the game and be able to anchor it self onto the ground to fire faster reload faster and make it be explosive shell fly faster the terran republics empire specific fighter the mosquito be the fast fighter in the game have the fast fire rate and the high ammo count but the low damagenew conglomerate be know for be the hardest hit faction they have the high damage weapon but tend to have the low amount of ammo and slow fire rate their weapon have high recoil and the fast bullet velocity in the game the new conglomerate main battle tank be the vanguard it be the slow move tank in the game but it do the high amount of damage have the fast velocity on it be main cannon and can take far more abuse than any other tank it also be able to activate a short invulnerability shield which be at the moment pretty overpower it allow the tank to easily turn a lost situation into an instant win during close range tank fight the new conglomerate empire specific fighter the reaver be the hard hit fighter in the game but have the slow fire rate and low ammo count in it be weapon vanu sovereignty be know for be a very adaptive empire they do not have high fire rate like the tr or the high damage like the nc but instead their weapon be sorta in between the stat you would see on a tr and nc gun they be pretty much jack of all trade but master of none sadly the vanu sovereigntys main battle tank the magrider be a hover tank it have the low damage per second dps and slow velocity but it be the most accurate tank and be able to strafe and climb large mountain and building which the other tank can not do it be a tank that be make for dodge incoming enemy projectile and flank the enemy quickly the vanu sovereigntys empire specific fighter the scythe be the most accurate fighter in the game it have the fast velocity and the good air brake however it be the slow fighter in the game and do not have the high fire rate of the mosquito or the high damage of the reaver instead it be damage and fire rate be between that of a mosquito and reaver now that i have introduce you to the three faction i will just quickly describe what the objective be in planetside 2 in planetside 2 you have to capture basis for your empire the more basis you have the close you get to lock down a continent for your empire which give you a50 discount for equipment vehicle aircraft during the day you will have random alert which pop up give everyone the same objective like capture x amount of y or hold the most territory on a continent before the timer run out the victor get award with more xp and bragging right for the win in planetside 2 you can have up to 2000 player on a single continent atm there be 4 continent in the game so a server can have up to 8000 people fight each other in the future when they add more continent they will keep increase the maximum player cap each time by 2000 battle in planetside 2 be pretty spectacular huge tank fight in large open field multiple large ship fly up in the air do dog fight organize outfit clan work together try to capture territory for their empire it be amazing when you see it all in motion there be simply no other fps multiplayer game that can do this at the moment now that i be do explain the basic to the people who be new or be plane to download the game it be time to share the large amount of problem the game have let us begin 1 for a game that be supposedly all about work together as a team to win people tend to play the game as more of a large endless team deathmatch only try to get more kill and high kdr so they can get high level and get more medal yes this be an issue with the playerbase however the reason this happen be because the game be lack a reason for you to capture territory and win thing for your empire you get far more award if you go to a fight where you can easily get some nice kill than go to a fight where you be outnumbered and try to defend a base that be require to win an alert there be a large lack of a metagame and an endgame in planetside 2 if an empire capture a continent nothing special happen that empire only get a 50 discount for vehicle or equipment for a short time which make capture continent pretty pointless so after a few week you will realize there be no point in planetside 2 except to get more weapon medal and improve your stat which be really really sad the game badly need a good metagame and endgame so planetside 2 can finally become that nice teamwork large scale game about fight for your empire with your friend 2 the game have serious issue with bug low frame rate and constant crash the game just love to crash on a occasion the frame rate can hit such low level the game turn into a power point presentation even on a above average pc the game be infest with bug where your vehicle may randomly explode because you touch some rock at a bad angle or you be unable to access the map to respawn force you to end the game with the task manager and the list go on 3 the game reuse a lot of asset on different weapon alot of gun in the game look exactly the same and some even sound the same they badly need to update these model so you can actually tell apart which gun be which without have to check a damn description 4 the game have serious issue with lag and hitbox detection hitboxe in planetside 2 sometimes just stop work you may find yourself unload all your ammo into someone at point blank range just to find out you do 0 damage to him and you will die a fair amount while behind cover or go around corner since the game have some issue with lag compensation this happen very often nowadays to the point where i can hardly play the game anymore some of the worst dedicated server i have ever see in a video game 5 the game have a lot of problem with bug exploiter and hacker the game have a sewere lack of game master to keep server in check from hacker and people who bug exploit like clip thru a floor and kill everyone on a capture point inside a base or a hacker who fly around in a tank or as infantry and headshot you immediately if he notice you and than just teleport somewhere else planetside 2 need to have it be anti cheat improve and more game master for each server to keep thing in check so these type of people do not ruin the game for everyone bottom line planetside 2 will make you regret the day you decide to play it break server with extreme high ping a hit detection that work only half of the time a toxic unfriendly and bad player base that turn newcomer into more toxicthat keep destroy the community developer that fail to accomplish anything lead director that continuously lie to it be player and so many more thing which i sadly can not fit here,neg

early access reviewnormally i do not write review but this game deserve one from me even tho it be in alpha the in depth system of it be absolutely amazing i have never play a alpha game that be so smooth so fun and addict its kind of like a space moba but extremely ballanced all you need to know be your ship class what they all be good against and a good tactic i mean come one who dosent want to get into a intense dogfight just to find out your the last one leave with 3 enemy surround you wait to jump you but let face it you get so into it when you hit your thruster out of there sight behind a astroid with no hull leave but some tin foil and some rocket speed at your face while warp out then make the jump back home just to go back out and fight this game have so much potential not only do you choose your ship but some awesome badass crew you can hire and put on your ship with catchy phrase soldi can not wait until the developer add more to this game its golden there s so many idea you can put into this game to keep it the great game it be i wish i could be on there development team myself that s how great there do with it but yes i do recommend it and this be a game i wll always come on to play i want to get more people into it and hopefully see other to warp right ontop of them and tackle them before they can even put there jump drive on and if the developer be happen to read this keep go its just amazing what you have create and always remember to keep it nice and ballanced just how it be hopefully i will see you all in game and let your body float around the cold cosmos,pos

early access reviewin my opinion this be a fairly fun game nothing to get addicted to but not a waste of time either combat be enjoyable and if the team be balance can be quite awesome along side this game visual my only complaint be not how long the loading screen be but rather how many there be and find this slightly annoying next complaint would match make and long wait time but this be due because of the small community and probably the wide variety of skill and the only way to fix this issue be either make the game short which please do not due that spoil some of the fun in this game or get a big community which be not easy although there be a wasy for you to help this play more more people play more in the pool less wait time,pos

many people who struggle to understand the core concept of this game would be incline to tell you that it be pay to win to of course diminish the fact that their profound lack of skill be not due to a lack of will or endeavor but that it be impossible to succeed in this game but this be untrue the very thing that they complain about and term pay to win be accessible to everyone from the very beginning of the game provide you allocate your earning correctly and understand how the game work the learn curve be quite steep so this be probably the reason for many quitting and term this a p2w the only thing that can be buy for real money that one could term necessary be the premium system wherein you earn 50 additional credit and experience the primary tool of progression so long as it be activate this provide absoultely no in game assistance but be merely a convienence tool to boost progression i myself use it as a full time student also work full time with generally only 5 or so hour a week to play the game any other core content can be earn if the childish playerbase take the time to learn the game understand the fundaental mechanic they would see the fruit of the game design and enjoy it the primary antithesis of this be the same as all multiplayer game the community be short temper and have a severe misunderstanding of the game if this game pique your interest certainly try and learn more before hop into play it will give you a significant advantage over those who choose to remain in ignorance out of self pity and lack of responsibility,pos

s3 be a joke with random bs current season s4 an even big joke their designer clearly only care about a game that be fun to watch on the esports they do not care if it end up be really stressful to actually play the ing thing and now push eac when ther eis absolutely no need for it in this game and several well in house approach that have none of the down side hr they have no respect for you and the game be not even as fun as it use to be burry this,neg
theese be one of first game i play on my gaming pc and it work just fine but then it update a lot sense i last play and now it lag like crazy if you have good internet this be the game for you,pos
early access reviewa game try to do somthing interesting cross platform with mobile but all the pc version be be a slightly upscale version with no difference from the mobile version if they make the pc port better maybe it will be a good game i play a bit in beta and the game have some good thing go for it mainly its good humor but thay be not enough to carry this game,neg
to be more powerful you have to spend alot time in it the game offer large variety of weapon modification and vehicle this game be more realistic than most other game but like all game there be always space for improvement i hope that more map other game mode and more weapon perk can be add to further enhance the experience of the game,pos
early access reviewi play this when i be still in school apart from ton of other game i like it but the reason i end up quitting be because you have to pay to unlock perk location extra stuff or special item and quest that suck for a game that more kid and teenager play than adult or young adult so that s why i stop play if i want neat stuff i have to pay and as a 15 year old your parent will not pay for anything like this unless they just do not care about spend a lot on a game it be early access and i want to see where this go and here be all the pro and con in my own opinion of it so far pro fun game ok graphic fun story if you bother to read or watch the cutscene fun character include the monster craft system lts of thing come soon from the 2d game which be also interesting tracking system need work lot of potentialcon already pay to get ahead this ruin ton of game for me and it ruin this one for me year ago with its membership pay to get access stuff also i want to buy some potion and they cost 200 gem i have to pay real money to buy beginner pition too much farming i get to craft you have to farm but the ammount suck and everyone be farm the same thing cost to gain ratio very poor quest be the minor acception but the amount of gold you get to how much you have to spend suck really badly include how much it sell for and if you need material it cost 2x as much as what you have craft item be bad you pay 50 gold and farm to get somete get and craft someting better and sell the other craft item for 2 gold bad tracking system i can not find 2 quest because no matter where i go it will not track where they be so i never find them bag system too cluttered need something to sort or at least have it set up differently than it be now not major but its not good action bar i do not need auto attack to be there that s pointless also maybe allow that to be move around so i can have a potion in the action bar quicker than press u and use but i have not explore the key bind menue so that s probably my own fault do not get me wrong its good and i hope it improve but for a free game you pay for a lot more than membership i mean why do i need gem to buy starter potion why do i need to pay for item that should be free if i want to pay it should be for membership only or if i want to buy special item again pay to get ahead or to be well than everyone else game ruin the whole structure of a game and its content i get developer need the money to improve but to make a majority ptw that s go to make some people turn to something else if we want to pay great but why do so much have to be pay for with real money i mean if you have thousand of player and half of those buy regular membership and the other half the 50 option do not you think that not almost everything need to be pay for i will keep play to see where this go because i want to see how this improve but if it just stay as a pay to win kind of mmo then it be just go to sink to the bottom of the barrel like the 2d one do for me anyway and other game that do not rely too heavily on this system will come out on top this have so much potential but potential can only go so far,pos
i reccommend this game the pay content be far well than the free car and 1 2 price car u can get car and track really cheap at the moment also make sure the game work b4 u put money into it check the forum something may fix an isssue u have also a common problem the 503 error not able to connect should hopefully be fix in upcomming itergration patch with steam so u do not need a seperate log in go to my document game and delete the simbin fold fix my log in problem which i think be cause by a computer crash while game be run also one of the free track be pretty good and a hill climb free track and u can test drive car b4 u buy them for a couple of lap so not like iracing u have to buy and hope this be a lot cheap and more fun in my opinion tho i still use the iracing for other stuff like oval nascar this have wtcc which iracing do not and a lot more gt3 car 13 plus the dtm series,pos
early access reviewthis game be great i play the original for a very long time and i support it on kickstarter it be very fun those who enjoy a good mmorpg if you do not then it may not be for you,pos
i give it a shot and play it most of the day i have be need a new tcg since starcrusade ccg be be abandon after just a few hour i find the two main problem with it 1 pay for card always mean pay to win no matter what game it be 2 the random mana flood or drought i know mana flood and draught have always be a thing but even when i follow guide on how to minimize this or avoid it i could only get decent amount of mana and get my deck to work 2 10 time that say to me it be a balancing issue or their deck shuffling be garbage enjoy the game if you like it but for me it be just not my cup of tea shame to since i be save all my gold to complete a quest to join a draft i would probably return if they fix these two issue and stop make draft so damn expensive 5000 gold just to join one damn it be only 3000 for an event oh and one last issue the campaign be super short with only one additional battle after that if you want to play more of it you have to pony up some real world cash an option to unlock the campaign with cash or the in game currency would be nice like i say if you like it good on you but it seem their really hit people wallet hard game be great graphic wise and i enjoy the story though,neg
this game be the most fun when your playing in a unit platton or with friend but it be also fun to play on your own the fact that it be free to play but have many feature that require time and effort to obtain the option to buy the in game currency allow be at time overwhelming but if you just want to mess around and play without worry about the cosmetic and the in game currency which you get from a variety of source then this game may be a good option for the player that be not worried about cosmetic and work hard for the somthing they want in game or be willing to put money into a game but no matter what the game be very fun,pos
i love tower defense game and this one be rather fun at the start it be a pay to win type of game but even if you do not pay latter on you can win this a great game if you rival be either not hack cheating or 3x high level than you self yes you will find people that do not have to place out anything and will win no matter what i have a number of hrs in this game and like to play it but the cheat be too much pay to win on a free game be ok but never lose be bs game be fun but not recommend this game have way to many cheat hack its not even fun,neg
early access reviewgreat fun for a basic style of game the quaility graphic ship mechanic weapon dps etc it be so well ballanced could do with a few new game mode all round good way to kill some time brain cell and enemy,pos
early access reviewthe current state of the game be ed this be in the start really promising i really like the game and would have give it a positive review back then now you can not even get access to most of the stuff in the game because of the loot crate i can not even choose what stuff i get in a game where the player be suppose to design the vehicle not their luck now people who do not pay the developer have to get rekt by chaingun,neg
game be fun good substitue for magic until i notice i be not get the legendary card for log in every 30 day twice in a row a while back i check out of curiosity just now and notice other people be have the same issue so i want to let people know if you want a good game that balance what you can do with a card game that be online with the depth of magic try eternal card game pretty fun and so far have not basically scamme me,neg
early access reviewpretty good game to play not to long of a download and shooter can go a long way this just make it plain and simple very good game to pass the time with if you like quick shooter,pos
when i first get the game i be a little skeptical but after about ten minute i be impressed with it be realism and accuracy i be kinda a firearm fenatic and this game be a great learning application as well as a fun addicting game it seem as if it would be a great tablet game but so do some of the graphic during the target shooting but over all the educational aspect over weigh this for me all in all i would totally recomend this game for anyone who want a challange and addicting gun simulator,pos
graphic be great but if you want to see the enemy tank you can just use low setting and all the foliage be remove this game be so free they incorporate a setting that would get you perma ban in other tank or fps game the tank map be some of the bad i have see in a game with so many year they have not a single good map and the assault map be the bad by far also on the assault map the enemy bot tank seem to have little problem pull of shot while drive from almost a kilometer away with rank 1 2 tank low rank non upgrade tank also have this unrealistic thing that they can not turn unless go forward or reversing which create frustrating situation the grind be there for what ever reason i need to grind out 6 tank before i can buy a next ranktank its the law no matter that there be not a single tank i want from the current rank still get to grind out 6 to move on they be not all in the same line so you got to research at least one line more from rank 1 so that you have enough line open to research 6 tank go figure how many player will do that and not move on to the next game where epic be free to pick up tl dr tank suck and so do the map when it come to the plane it all look pretty and if you do not mind the balance issue which i really do not think can be work out in any game with this many different plane it can be fun to fly if you do not end up fly the low rank plane the premium time be way overpriced for what it do same with the competitor,neg
i do not where to start this game be amazing fun for me that be i really enjoy the mix of tactic and scale of the whole game be it for everyone no but what be breathe mabye i be go to keep this short since well there be many well review of this then what i can put out but yeah download it play it have fun or do not but i say u should so yeah bye,pos
this little gem be absolutely pant ly terrifying how i hear you cry surely because of the cutesy graphic it could not possibly be scary right wrong dead wrong ahem the soft graphic be what the game use to lull you into a false sense of security after gain your trust the game begin pile on the atmosphere like a dumptruck at a dumptruck convention after the first 50 100 room or so it become clear that the cutesy cardboard jumpscares be not the only thing plague you as you journey through what quickly become a monstrous hellscape bear out of your own nightmare the game also nod and pay homage to most genre of horror and even reference some popular horror game such as five night at freddys and resident evil the game be not very long but if you be a coward like me then you will only be able to play it in short 200 room burst if you be bored and look for a sp00ky time then pick up spookys house of jump scare and prepare to spend a lot of money on new underwear because trust me youl need them,pos
this game its free to play try but if you want to get the most out of it you be go to have to put some money down i have spend almost 300 and i be sure ill be puttin some more down on this one but i have alot of stuff and with lot of stuff come lot more gameplay with that say there be alot more i want i guess it come down to if you really enjoy something you will support it the game be relax i feel like i be in the great outdoors and that make me happy happy camper there be no rank up or play to unlock here if you do not like this then i would recommend thehunter call of the wild for me call of the wild be an arcade style game if you be look for a realistic hunting game then this be it but be aware there be a paywall but i know people that spend 500 on game like gta5 or any real free to play mmo if you love something support it its slow moving and some hunt be well than other but that s just it that s what keep me go 10 10 for me i be also aware that i can spend a bit of cash and most people can not but for 50 you can get the trailrunner bundle and you will be on your way with some great gear,pos
never before have i have such a profound hatred for other human being you can not leave i have try and will most likely try again soon mostly what this game have teach me be this i be a racist bigot everyone i know be a racist bigot even the peruvians and russians be racist bigot everyone be stupid teamwork like sleep be a false promise do not queue in group of people less than 5never go alone seriously it be that important you will not have fun angsty narcissistic 10 year old exist everywhere everyone be a noob even you do not delude yourself search your feeling you know it to be true run,pos

early access reviewi play many of artix entertainment game before my top two be bye far aqw adventure quest world and mechquest i be beyond hype when i hear it be ready for early access play the game itself be amazing for any past fan of the aq games the camera be off and the combat be stiff and there be almost no character customization yet one of my favorite thing in aqw be the customaztion and see everyone look differnt from eachother sadly you can not go 5 ft without seenig triple and of course there be the upgrade to guardin deal as in most of thier game these paywall be a drawback but its possible to enjoy the game without them at this time i would recommend the game if you wish to see it grow to its full potential if not wait a few month the game update fairly often,pos
look at the amount of time i have put in this game great concept i have fun but then i try play rank let me start with i work in the army as an infantryman i know what toxic people be like this game have the most toxic player base i have ever play with do not know how to function as a pro you get report do not execute every manuever with the synergy of a fortune 500 company you get report its very much a team game and in a world of troll and dbags you be not reward for try at all ill save you 200 hrs and tell you you suck stop play and why be you even try avoid this game,neg
early access reviewit have the feel of hearthstone in term of graphic the ability to click the arena and the easy visual style the card be not tiny like some game with the variety of color of mtg the ai be a little non optimized but i think it will probably get well,pos

early access reviewi be preach to the choir here i almost re download this game after not play for maybe a year i figure i would check the recent comment first since i see that recently it have a ton of negative review needless to say i be glad i do not waste my time sad to see such a awesome concept of a game go to complete waste on this f2p marketing scheme i hope someone copy the concept of this game and succeed great than these fat cat ever could have,neg
i have play this game for year on kongregate and when i see it on steam i download it immediatly this be a great rpg game that make you collect and better yourself with quest and loot however this be a game where you may need friend to make it an enjoyable experience you can lock onto your friend and teleport to them so you never lose them i strongly suggest get this game if you have a friend or two to play it with,pos
early access reviewi really enjoy the magic meet hearthstone gameplay and epic action polish of eternal it be very generous with free to play reward so you get a fun sense of progression and there be regular promo and event my absoolute favorite element of the game the one that keep me play it even when hearthstone be so much more polished be the wonderful limited gameplay mode there be forge sort of a version of hearthstone arena that be playable against increasingly strong ai opponent and there be draft even better reasonably effective asynchronous draft so you do not have to devote a huge block of time to playing or wait for the draft queue to launch and it be okay if you get interrupt etc very much worth check out if you like collectible card game at all,pos
early access reviewthis game be lot of fun it be heavily inspire by minecraft which i can tell but it be really original too since its free to play posibbilitie in game be endless if you have pretty good imagination and creativity you can build some pretty cool stuff but ya ill rate 10 10 for this game because it be simply amazing game i recomend this to anyone who enjoy play minecraft or any new people to the genre,pos
this game take away my life but i do not regret it it have hour of rage tear and joy you meet really nice people here and there be a large range of customization really the only thing i do not like about this game be that the staff will harass you for a month about change your inappropriate name and ban you until you do but overall its a good long game and i recommend it,pos
this be the good card game i have play and my new favorite unless the cyanide and happiness card game come to pc somehow it be get an incredible amount of tactical depth from be able to select an avatar from one of the elder scroll race to affect how you collect card as you progess through the game to be able to level up certain card when you your avatar level up i be 18 battle into the story campaign and i have be present with many story relate option that give me different card base on the choice i make there be also many different type to the card that be attribute to different stat as you play through the story or level up you unlock new deck that augment different play strategy base on the 2 main attribute that make up the deck in the deck editor you can pick up to 2 main attribute for your different deck what attribute you choose affect the type of card you can put in those deck there be some duel class card and a fair amount of neutral card that do not belong to any attribute mostly monster and dwemer construct from what i have see thus far but most card belong to one attribute strength intelligence agility endurance and willpower each one provide more card of that type that help its playstyle as you level up for example a deck of strength and intelligence would likely have a lot of magic spell and creature for intelligence and many creature item weapon that be focus on an aggressive playstyle in contrast a willpower and endurance deck would have a lot of small creature and way to augment them to be large tough from the willpower and a lot of card help you out more and more the longer the match go on from the endurance there be also the fact that there be usually 2 lane to the combat sometimes the lane have special effect that change what happen to creature in that lane for example there be a shadow lane that provide cover to creature the first turn they be place so they can not be attack by other creature during that turn there be windy lane that move a random creature from one lane to another and even an arena lane that give a random item to any creature summon to that lane with so many different variable and more be discover every few match this game be rapidly become one of my favorite edit you can only have up to 70 card in your deck and a minimum of 50 card a maximum of 3 copy of a card can be in your deck and some card be legend ultra rare and you can only have 1 of those per deck excess card can be trap in soul gem and will give you a number of soul gem base on its rarity and how many there be of it you can then use those soul gem to soul summon card you do not already have of course well card have high soul summon cost you can also collect gold from battle and use that gold to buy card pack or entry ticket to the arena battle up to 10 opponent with a randomly draw deck until you beat all 10 or lose 3 time chance for well than normal and more than normal prize or you can save them up to purchase in game dlc the dark brotherhood dlc appear to be able to be purchse a la carte use ingame currency yet another plus for the game in my opinion you can also earn more card pack in game through play and some of your card have different path they can be upgrade along,pos
the game be good only problem be that different intrface symbol or little picture should be label by explanation when hover a mouse the battle itself be variative interesting and skill dependent thank to alatriste for ad,pos
this game make me happy smite be very fun sometimes it make me not happy very not happy but it be not the game that do that it be the people great coomunity horrible low class would recommend smite apartheid,pos
while i would whish i could write a positive review as the developer really create a small innovative potentially enjoyable game the free to play price just make it impossible the producer have obviously go berserk render the price for the stuff you can buy about 25 seriously twentyfive time too high to be anything even close to fair though one could argue as often do you do not have to buy any of the stuff that would just ignore dynamic of psychology which be so offensively exploit here high tier crafting be render nearly useless without buy the booster as craft one single high tier weapon take between 1 2 week with booster produce 4 5 of those weapon instantly can cost about 90a seriously bethesda software as there be up to 200 dweller to get equip apart from the definitly miss pause function and the continually be rip away from whatever you be just do by disaster and birth autozoom especially in survival mode pretty annoying the developer should be cuddle while the producer should be hunt out of their office with wet towel a shame really i would so like to give it a thumb up but the producer just spoil the lovely idea the developer obviously put into it,neg

probably one of the good game i have see in my life team fortress 2 combine the teamwork and the individual skill perfectly make you feel useful even if the only thing you have do in the match be kill a random person nine mean nine way of playing which actually translate in nine different game at least at first as soon as you start unlock weapon you will discover that you can play with a class in a whole different way refresh your interest for the game if that be not enough to keep you play this game forever valve release update every few month week or even day with ton of fix and more importantly addition to the game make you want to play more and more but that be not the good part everything important in this game be 100 free unlockable weapon which be the good part of the game will drop randomly as you keep play make pay user not well than free to play user no pay2win in this,pos
early access reviewi really be try to give this game some form of a chance but it would be unfair to tell anyone to buy this game in the current state it be in when you look past all the issue of the game it have potential but the reality be they will not be fix this game be delay in june 2017 to be polish even more but apparently they do not even spend a second polishing this game at all horrible google translation perma loading screen server and faction lock awful optimization 1060gtx 10fps on anything above the low setting disabled action combat and all of the feature plan for endgame the developer have make no announcement regard how they will address all of these issue the only issue they have address be that they be go to fix balance for damage and heal the least concern currently save your money maybe keep an eye on it to see if they may improve within the first few month but the current outlook make it seem like they have no intention of solve their error i have purchase the founder pack and have the two day head startedit as of 6 21 they have only make the game bad and seem to have no idea what they be do with balancing and overall make the game well combat have become bad and sloppy and they still have no intention of fix the lag or optimize the game,neg
one of the good horror game imo it be free it be cute and it be e horrible at the beggining it be just cute jump scare here cute jump scare there open door and it you start think well this be not so bad i guess but after your first real horror encounter you begin to feel chase everywhere you go and the cute jump scare be not cute anymore you know something be after you and begin question wether to continue on or not but you know that you must i highly recommend it it be free so what be you wait for it will be a very pleaseant experience trust me on that,pos
early access reviewpretty good game especially for a free to play decent firefight kind of a pubg clone but who give a toss snow boarding be pretty lit nice snow physics for ya,pos
this be not a free game you have to py to be able to have fun and play with freind also you need to pay for every single basic ability or need for this game waste of time and waste of download time waste of computer space waste of money if you pay for it waste of your life waste of poeple time totaly a disaster,neg

early access reviewnot sure what all the negative review be for its alpha there will always be a bit of bug a server lag sometimes the dev on the other hand actually listen to the comuinity and there be update and patch frequently it be a super fun and good battle royale,pos
early access reviewlook i would love to give this game a positive review but i can not it can be fun sometimes but most of the time your team get whoop by the enemy team cause they spend more money on crate and nobody ever comunicate you will get a 1 1000000 chance of get one other person who will actually speak more than this team suck i be better than all of you plus this game be super pay to win if you do not get premium say goodbye to most customization option and half of the loot you earn i be not joke without premium you only get half of the loot crate content woah you get a legendary well first you get to pay premium for that also good luck get the part you need because everything you can sell for in game credit be only worth about 1 5 of how much in game credit it cost to buy the same thing you be sell for example ghoast module be a legendary item you get get it in the in game block store for roughly 150 000 in game credit you can only sell it for about 30 000 in game credit why there be so much more i want to say but i can not rant for too long so this be all but i have some advice instead of make a free game where over half the content be lock behind a pay wall which you should know to get permanent premium cost about 50 100 you should just make your game cost money instead make the game 10 20 heck maybe even 50 if your that greedy but do not lock over half of the actuall game behind a pay wall,neg
the base gameplay be very fun if maybe a bit monotonous great shooting mechanic and the fact you need to think about where and when you hit somebody add a lot in my opinionexample you be in a weak light tank face a heavy armoured tank who just spot you you could go for the body shot that will likely bounce deal insignificant damage on the other hand you could try to take out his turret by kill the gunner he will not die but he will not be able to return fire for a while now this work great on some tank and not at all at other there be also amazing detail in the different tank stats visual and general feel now the the reason i will never recommend this game in it be current state be after around tier 4 5 you will hit a brick wall in term of progression it will easiely take you 40 hour to unlock the next tank and you will need several tank in the same tier to continue progress the premium be one option even then it be a long long grind you will also feel another limitation in term of silver lion ingame currency not only will you need 40 hour for exp unlock you will also need to grind as many if not more to unlock a tank it be upgrade and if you think that be fair okay then just hope you do not get damage and have to repair that will set you back a few thousand silver lion you can actually lose currency from a match if you repair enough and last nail in the coffin lot of the premium tank real money be often way strong than the free equivalent leave you with a sour taste in your mouth when get repeatedly kill by them even when you get the first hit term of balance it be really bad mid tear but supposedly it get well at end game never get there,neg
very mixed feeling about this game i still play it a lot and it can still be fun to play casually but if you ever decide to go into rank and try to improve there be some glaring problem in the game mechanic that can not go unnoticed this game be not like smash in fact blue mammoth game try as hard as possible to be different from smash so the mechanic be different and in a lot of way simple however this do not mean the game do not take skill in fact i believe that brawlhalla actually have a pretty decent skill ceiling however become well at the game be not always fun especially when you be near the top you will soon realize that the punish game in brawlhalla be ten time harder than smash and some legend weapon in the game be downright annoying brawlhalla also utilize a dodge mechanic instead of the standard block and instead of grab brawlhalla require you to read the opponent and although there be read pattern people tend to follow and move that you can use to cover multiple dodge direction the enemy still have 9 way to dodge and 11 way to react i do not know why but i have not exactly be able to bring myself to quit the game yet i would always rage from rank but come back some other day and i think it have to do with how accessible the game be you can load up brawlhalla and be in a ranked match play a 1v1 in under a minute no joke make it a great game to play when you be short on time tl dr very fun casual gameplay aids rank the higher you go flawed mechanic decent skill ceiling compare to smash although annoy to improve at highly accessible when short on time also the lag holy atmatmatmatm,pos
early access reviewthe game be fun and i have personally sink 100 hour into it the problem with the game now be bad than ever 1 remove class be beyond frustrating 1 ability do not make this game unique anymore 2 rune you now face opponet that you have no idea if headshot matter do they move 10 fast etc until its too late for pro gamer this be fine for 90 of the normal player like me this be unplayable 3 not have any clue how to approach fight do they have ice block barricade fire bomb who know until the fight begin again pro this be fine but 90 of the player base like me this be unplayable 4 back to pts 3 and 4 imagine a moba like lol where the game begin and you run into lane and see an avatar of a hero you begin to pick and poke and then aall of a sudden bam ability you have no idea which one until it happen fun i know i think in the end what do it for me and many other be it have the ow paladins moba style feel to your character in game that you could customize as you go then start again the next game now its just rando on rando on rando i will not be play it much anymore which be say hirez always find a way to ruin good idea for game,neg

a few year ago i be search the internet for hunting game and i stumble upon thehunter i play the game for a fairly long time since it be a one of a kind hunting simulation first i start as a guest it be a kind of trial membership but i become bored pretty fast since you only can hunt one species mule deer and only have one gun if you be willing to pay for a real membership you can hunt all the specie in the game and also get a couple weapon and unlimited ammunition for them eventually the company behind thehunter become kinda greedy and that change the whole game literally if you want to enjoy the whole game and want to take part in all competition you have to invest a good amount of money for example you do not have to buy every single weapon but then you will have a limited selection of competition you can participate in you do not have to buy every lure or whatever but then you have a disadvantage against other player who buy all the stuff you be not willing to buy and use long story short the free version of the game be just a playable demo in my opinion if you really want to have fun in thehunter you will have to invest a good amount of real money other review already mention the price so i will not go into that in my review if you be willing to do so you will get the good hunting simulation you can get at the moment it be nothing like any other hunting game out there here you will get a simulation for your money and not just another cabe arcade type of game unfortunately i have to give this game a thumb down since it become way too expensive to enjoy in it be full,neg

early access reviewsuper fun more interesting strategy than hearthstone but a well digital game than mtg tutorial will seem slow if you have experience with tcgs though there be lot of interesting interaction between mechanic to explore,pos

ok i have see enough let me start from the beginning i really want to like this game i have be read about it way before premiere i be hope for something trully fresh and mindblowing instead of that we have get this trash i know i have spend only couple of hour play but if game do not want me to try its content then i uninstall it performance issue it be one big lagfest it may be ok somewhere when no one else be but then try to visit some location with other player not to mention big city game run terribly and it be not a fault of my pc other even new mmo run smoothly i have get stick three time inside wall floor stone and each time i have to use recall stone and run all the way over to the place be i get stick once i fall over the map i could watch freefall of my character as texture go up to the sky quest expe there be almost no exp for kill monster so it be well to leave them alone and just run from one quest to another i could understand that if the quest be fun oh my god they be not run couple of minute from one npc to some place do something for 3 second and run again to the same another npc so if quest be mostly run and kill monster make no sense what else can i do i have hear about dungeon but i do not have enough patientce to level up anymore combat this be another issue for me maybe not for everyone maybe it be just me unfortunately combat be one of the bad i have see in a while bore unintuitive and simply not fun but what s the reason in make it fun if you do not even want to kill any mob right positive i really like character creation plenty of race and class a lot of different option of body shape face hairstyle color etc all that you need to create your unique avatar graphic be also pretty decent i stop couple of time just to watch something but you can see that game engine have couple of year it do not explain why my computer have so much trouble with fps i will say it again i really really want to like this game i have wait before buy it and i be glad that i dint spend any money on it i finally try it on free to play and after 3 3 5 hour it get out of my disc seriously try anything else maybe there be not a lot of new title but this one be simply not worth it not to mention good mmo like wow gw2 ffxiv eso etc or even this average neverwinter aion archeage etc it be even well for you to try something like rider of icarus or revelation online then something like bless ps i totallt forget about one annoying thing game chat oooo man mostly russian alphabet dumb people spam some dumb thing and from time to time something normall as it always be in crappy f2p game,neg

this game be a mixed bag this game do not bring any new innovation to this genere game type this game have so much potentional of be good but fail upon that this game do not look anything that the thumbnail of this game suggest it look like more of a sci fi tank genre in the thumbnail then modern do not get me wrong i be not say modern be bad all i be say be many other company like war gaming have already do this type of game and theirs be much well in term of effect and whatnot there be frankly nothing exciting or new here i do understand that this be a beta game and i may change my review if the follow change more detailed map well graphic i do not mention on improve graphic in many review because i get the target auidence that the company be try to fullfill but i believe the target auidence for this game be for those who want immersion and a well graphical experince i understand that this be a free to play game but on that same note world of tank be also free to play with much well graphic well physic i be not sure what be off with the physics but i do detect something be dull about it i think the explosion of the projectile upon impact need improvement as well as mechnic of the tank itself need more gamemode not just elimination the gamemode be crazy fast need to be gamemode where you can select what you wish to play although i suspect that they will be add this feature later on the 60fps cap need to be remove i could not find such way to remove it in the setting tab let the user decide if they wish to have a 60fps or not i have a 140hz monitor with dual 1080 in sli and i want to get above 60fps and i be not able to the above point be make me lead into my second point they should support multiple gpu setup for those who have such luxary to do so i also notice those line on the edge of object e i tank box battlefield decor etc this be a result of have limit graphical setting with no aa option please fix this too give incentive to player who be not premium user so all the free user let us not forget that the free user make up majority of this game and there should be more incentive without make the premium feel uneeded but have the less pay to win vibe go on if these be fix i may give the game a second go but for now i can not recommend the game in its current state it be however a good time killer i suppose and that be what it will ever be until they make more improvement which give player incentive to keep come back and play more,neg

early access review buggy and imbalanced but a fantastic take on the battle royale genre the class and weapon ability forge system be super creative intuitive and a very nice mixup to the genre become a chicken as oppose to the usual downed state be so much more exciting and frankly its hilariouos i will for sure follow this game through its development it can really only get well from here be we look at the next fortnite,pos

early access reviewi start this game think i will be do in a few mintue this game be very addictive and seem pretty balanced they should probably add a tutorial section but its pretty straight forward overall great game,pos
early access reviewway more polished than pubg also free the main thing to know be what difference it have compare to other game in the genre you get a starting loadout and there be actual spawn point you choose your spawn during the the 1 minute setup and you can see where other player be spawn as well the spawn be well space out this couple with the start equipment mean that the start of the game be less insane than other br game you never feel like you be take out before you have a chance to play even in the inevitable city frenzy everyone will have a chance to loot a house before it kick off the travesal equipment be the most unique thing about this game with each loadout you get a gun a piece of equipment medkit extra ammo ect and a mobility item you have a choice between hang glider snowboard and climbing kit with the hanglider you can leap off of any ledge and not only land safely but get a boost of speed in the direction you be go snowboard allow you to move at vehicle speed on any downward slope finally the climb gear allow you to climb at special place on the map that other player would have to take the long way around the climbing gear be not really as fun but they counter that by start you with a shotgun finally you be not fight till the last man team stand you be try to board a chopper with only 4 seat however most of the time it still turn into a last man team standing game but the fact that if you can create enough chaos you may be able to climb that ladder without be blast add a bit of spice to the end game,pos
  i have a couple 100 hour on the non steam version of this game gameplaythis game have a handful of thing to do but it mainly come down to you either go build or you go run out there with a train of other adventurer to slay monster over and over and over this game be the pure definition of a mindless grind serversthere be no avoid it if people talk about trove for long then 5 minute the server will eventually come up in conversation it do not matter really where in the world you be locate you could be within the same area as the server or you could be all the way across the world you will lag slip and slide like it be the late 90 on a dial up connection in the past they have stop this by put some aggressive queue in place but clearly they have just stop give a damn at this point directionthe developer seem to have no clue what exactly they want for the game they have move back on unlock class multiple time make them cash only and then not again and then make them craftable now there be a new class and i think hey i still have 13 class unlock token from back in the day time to have so fun with the new class but no instead they decide to not allow that to happen you better pay fifty dollar for the new class or do some unexplained new craft recipe even bad for the first day after release of the class you could unlock the class with the token there be one catch if you do so you get ban for bug abuse word can not begin to describe how dumb this be the lack of direction be not only something find in the how class system but across the board with the portal the dungeon or any of the multiple layer of convoluted progression this game have prosit be freeif you enjoy the kill part of minecraft the most you will find some enjoymentyou can submit your own stuff like dungeon and weapon and they can get add to the game consit be repetitive as all hellthe dev do not know what they want themselvesthe cash shop have everything from overpriced pack to rng box the server poop themselves dailyif you use item as intend you can get your account ban after the factthis game go down in quality start after the summer of 2015,neg
early access reviewbefore this review start to fade away and you have to click read more i will just state it simply that this game probably be not ready for most people especially those unfamiliar to the series it have a lot of potential however so if you like simple mmos you may want to go claim a nice name or something i also note that i have never play any prior adventurequest game but have play multiple mmorpg as of this review my character be level 5 adventurequest 3d be a very basic mmorpg i can not stress that out enough right now from character creation to combat most feature be very barren and unnoteworthy as of the current version limitation be a word that come to mind and it be probably due to the game itself only be at its beta stage customization have few option and there be only three or four if include the pay for class class the player have to choose from all of which be primarily dps base honestly i believe that the combat be what really get to me in this game it be bore and when put together with the general mmorpg aspect of grind be require get very grating there just do not appear to be much challenge all class have four move and a quick autoattack and most opponent be quickly take down with them teamwork be nearly nonexistant be basically just slay monster together by coincidence with little communcation there be so many people online and it be a shame that there be not any encouraging to work together early on as far as i be aware there be not even a party system but i could be wrong strategy unfortunately do not seem to be a highlight as of now map be small and host a few number of unique mob prepare to slay the same monster 30 time each with your same 4 move maybe with one random person who happen to be nearby while craft do prove to be an incentive make a cardboard crown make me very happy it be undeniable that it get repetitive there be a lack of a feeling of reward that some other game manage to capture probably because of the grind begin so early on the size of the map only add on to this feeling of repitition there be little to see other than the unfriendly neighborhood mob i like their design really but after see the same face over and over that sense of wonder become exhausted despite this the game do have character i enjoy the cutscene and the personality of the many npc which seem highly self aware it be funny description for item often have humorous joke in them still i just do not think that it have enough to keep me play for long however as say before the game be in its beta stage wander around the central town there be plenty of unopened shop for honestly interesting feature to come like pet and housing the creator of the game from what i can tell do want to hear feedback which be a good sign and perhaps if you be more willing than i be to play around you could help improve the game with your own suggestion it have potential but right now adventurequest 3d just feel too bare bone for me so if you really want to try this game go ahead i do not think most player will become heavily invest in it like with other game but it be worth a brief try if maybe for a few minute and who know what the future hold for this game it be probably good thing,neg
early access reviewi have to agree with everyone great game so far it be an alpha and it can be unstable it crash twice in an hour of play and there be not many upgrade or customization to ship but it be a lot of fun i remember another reviewer say it be unbalanced i actually disagree each category of ship have a very distinct feel and great strategic potential the problem be that most people play this game right now be just like you intrigue gamer just try it out a bit because of this no one coordinate and no one really try to win you also can not currently change ship type in game so if the other team be full of assassin and sniper and your team be make of nothing but flagship you be go to get your butt hand to you but if you happen to get on a balanced team it be pretty fun get it try it out love it anticipate the future,pos
early access reviewbig ship in space who would not want to dance the slow and deadly dance of cap ship slug it out at each other f look good and i do not run into any bug first time run it lack any kind of tutorial the learning curve can be a bit harsh but once you realize how thing work it be a big fun team work a must in this one grab a copy and jump in just remember that big ship be slow,pos

after have sink more than 1000 hour into this game in the last three league i feel it be time to write a short review if you like diablo 2 and hate diablo 3 not because of the lack of pvp you be go to love path of exile the game be e huge with ton of challenge you will not be grind the cow level or do baal run after baal run for the good loot that the game have to offer the mapping system ensure that you be experience new content even after you beat the story i be give you a warning though if you be addict to diablo 2 you will be addict to this,pos
not worth the time it have beginner server but the pro play in them all the time barely get into the game then get shoot and on top of that you have to wait a full minute before the game shove you out of the server because you can not respawn you just have to restart the server,neg

i have hundred of hour in many digital and real life card game and this one be an overly complex mess riddle with borderline copyright theft from similar game especially hearthstone the new player experience be a ing chore with mandatory tutorial that blast annoying sound that the game take too long to allow you to get to the woeful option menu and turn off be this a pc game or a phone game because it have shity option for pc and the art be tiny and too intricate for mobile user it honestly feel like scumbag corp that bethesda have become just tell there art department to copy hearthstone and slap some unused skyrim art on the card obviously a lot of card game will contain similar ability and use of language but this game take the ingtrust me anyone with a thesaurus couldn have do better the game ultimately feel like the homer simpson car in which go for a deep experience mean take every aspect of all other card game and throw them into a bucket hey bethesda when you throw ever color onto the canvas all you get be brown goopy mud frustration aside be the sad fact that this game be so boooring like please end my suffer level of lame the game client be slow and unresponsive and the art all look like it have a brown tint not to mention the annoyingthe voice actor endlessly spew over the top of the cliched epic music which thank god you can mute the funny feeling you get while play this particular theme be wow i really wish i be play gwent which be probably what y all should wait for druidstone be a broken mess shadowverse be great but no one play it and gwent be not really out yet but even still i would not waste your time with thisand if you be still not convinced let me tell you the most scummy thing about the game they include how to purchase card for real money in the tutorial before you know what the hell anything even do from the creation club to this crap what the hell happen to this company that create classic like morrowind and skyrim,neg
access reviewi instal this game for free on steam this be an intricate battle royale game that look and feel a lot like fortnite there be four different class which all have their unique ability there be no vehicle and no sprinting but there be horse and that be okay but not as good the goofy white flag chicken be not realistic and become annoying to become and to hunt down i really enjoy play this game and i recommend instal it on steam,pos
very fun and entertaining game there be a lot to get use to and explore and i love this a while back but stop play it for a while and i be die to play it again it appeal to not just fps player but it be also a very strategic game building fob the vehicle and combination of a squad you can go with it be honestly just really fun to explore,pos
this game be absolutly awesome every class have its unique skill and every single one of them be greatgraphic be not bad and never get boringthis game may look hard at the first time but when you reach 20 hour of playing then you can not stop play and you want to play more and more but the good part be gameplay control be very smooth after 2 hour of playing you can find the class that be make for you i play a lot multiplayer game but from my opinion this game be the good multiplayer game ever make 10 10thank you valve,pos
run of the mill free to play experience by this i mean money waste mechanic design to do nothing but expend your in game money and make buying say money more appeal a gem upgrade system with a massivly high fail rate even at 90 hint its not really 90 or companion that require week worth of currency farming to upgrade arbitrary time waste mechanic that serve no purpose but to push the ability to sell speed up and to make sure you consistantly log in and push those active sub number up craft timer and diamond refinement limit be the two bad offender paywall for the most useful content good race or companion that do not die in a single shot cost real money though you can buy companion thru the ah its generally hundred of thousand of diamond to do so constant reminder to use the microtransaction store every time you log in the store icon be illuminate until you click on it minor gripe and the most common drop in the game be a chest that require a key that cost 1 usd you will amass hundred of these stupid thing and they will serve no purpose but to waste the limited bag space another pay wall for all its monetization fault its still a very fun game the combat be fast and active meaning you do not simply stand in place turn on your auto attack and cycle the same rotation over and over you be force to dodge attack and use positioning to ensure maximum efficency this put its combat right up there with gw2 or tera the map be functional but its very clear your traverse a video game if that make sense to you its an open world but a cell base one think the first 2 s t a l k e r game or gw2 the quest system be like any other mmo with a slight tweak where you get item reward before you turn in in some case pretty cool since you get that new item right away and do not have to run back to town for it by far the good feature of this game be the foundry system its basically a instance editior that give any player over lv 15 access to the tool to make their very own map instance if you be into modding or make map this will be a dream come true and possibly a way for you to never have to worry about money in game player who like you map can tip you in the game main currency this alone be worth play i just wish they do not nerf xp to the ground in foundry mission and instance i understand why they do it but you either chain quest or you simply do not level lot of fault lot of thing do right but overall i do not feel like these monetization practice should be support cosmetic i take no issue with but when you start gimp your game to push microtransaction i have a serious problem and this game do just that it do not feel like it do at first but by lv 40 you will be pull your hair out over the thousand of lose diamond from upgrade or the fact that nearly every single profession quest require specific laborer that be either purchase outright or require farming profession bag you buy on the ah for ten of thousand of diamond each,neg
wait spawn run die simulator 2016 10 10 ignseriously though what a load of crap the only reason i have put 40 hour into this game be because of the damn progression addiction and rank all i see be try hard with lmgs name get rekt nab or i love adolf so yeah if you would like a game where you spawn and in the space of 10 second you get bomb by a plane blow up by a tank snipe by a recon run over by a jeep or 2 shot by a camper with an lmg then by all mean give it a play,neg
have try a few other mobas namely dota2 lol and hot i could never get into them hot i play the most of probably due to my familiarity with the blizzard universe perhaps it be the camera view probably why i do not play rtss anymore smite have a 3rd person camera view that help me a lot to make another comparison it look a lot like world of warcraft so if you be someone who would love to jump into a moba but be really use to a 3rd person camera view like in wow or guild war 2 or many other game hell even god of war or devil may cry then smite may be a good one to try this review be not mean to rate the game as i be still consider myself a noob but more or less an attempt to help someone who may be on the fence about try it,pos
i wish i could leave a proper review but i can not why because after 4 day of reinstall and redownloade and do what the support team tell people i can not get past the opening cutscene i meet all the system requirement but when i go to skip the opening cutscene to get to character creation the program stop respond i can not fix this and pwe cryptic have no info about this specifically do not bother with the pc version as it most likely will not work at all,neg

early access reviewreally good foundation with a nice twist to the br genre the game will only get well with the eventual addition of weapon skin more customization option new weapon and map i can not wait,pos
early access reviewreally love this like a cross between hearthstone mtg and hex this game be great there be a ton to do without spend money and price be good if you do spend money can do draft vs ai as well as regular match vs ai to win money for pack and if you do the daily quest which just require you to play other people you can make lot of gold for pack and content,pos
broken game in its current state only because of how unbalanced it be way too easy to just save up and send regeneration rainbow bloon balance your game ninja kiwi not a fun game i know it say i have no time put into this game but that be only because i play countless hour on other platform when play a match you can either use your money to buy upgrade monkey to defend or send bloon at your opponent to increase your income usually that would be find but around wave 12 13 if your opponent save up money for a few round can just win with like a 70 success rate the ability to do this discourage player to get to further wave like 30 40 why waste 30 minute on a game you could end up lose when you can just save up at round 8 9 and send rainbow regen and win in like 10 minute you do not have to play many game to see how infest the online play be with this cheap dirty technique without a doubt the majority of player play like this and it make the game unfun to play,neg
early access reviewwow fantastic digital ccg with a variety of game mode to play and all of the game mode reward you with either gold or card it be a very f2p friendly game if you like hearthstone but want a little more depth to the game this be absolutely the game for you with some mtg influence as well it can be challenging to absolute newbie in the ccg genre but do not worry you will pick it up very quickly i do have one warn the begin campaign tutorial be quite long so be prepared for that otherwise great game would recommend to all my card game love friend,pos
early access reviewdownloade the game like a champ and be able to create character on the only server at the time do not bother to play on the first day because none of my friend could make it onto the server fast enough day 2 can not get onto my original server due to queue time and the queue freeze randomly force a full restart make another character on a new server and get in no problem make it less than 5 minute into the tutorial quest can not for the life of me understand the horrible translation know from other user that it be god awful still could not figure out how to add skill to my bar or whatever it want from me i must be hella disabled to not figure out something as simple as click a skill i guess later discover my husband can not launch the game in the same region as me if i have the game open and vice versa no idea what be cause that problem never see it on any other online game we have play together they have swol cat girl but that be not enough to prevent a refund,neg

early access reviewthis game could be one to rival pubg seriously the graphic be stunning and the world be far more detailed there be a ton of item in the game already and the gunplay be fine the game also run pretty well for what it look like although some more setting would be nice to make it run slightly well the only thing this game need be a progression system character customization more player in a game at once i would also say as a tip to the dev to keep the game free until they have fix stuff and add progression this game be good but at the moment pubg do offer more content if you be think about get this while its free do it its great no squad yet though edit winner winner with the dinner,pos

this review be more for the purist simmer and more of a rant in regard to the dcs be a fool gold sim comment ed have do a great job keep dcs in the balance between realism and inspiration by inspiration i mean include everything from graphical beauty immersion etc a lot of review have mention the same as far as the realism and overall i would have to agree like i say the game be balanced ok you could call it an intermediate level flight sim but people do go overboard with both the positive and negative look dcs rest just at the base of the mountain second peak we purist flight simmer call realism it attempt to scale this peak with some thing here and there but if i be to make a list it would seem the game be still in beta this will stir a lot of humdrum and i do not want to sound like the dcs be crap band wagon but i be sorry run falcon bms for a few year and any other flight sim turn into a cute and adorable attempt at push the envelope but dcs be not mean to be an ultra realistic sim it serve its purpose and quite well i may add can you program your entire flight plan and popup attack run no but its fun there be a blanket albeit a thin one but nonetheless a blanket of a generic engine the entire sim sit just in that narrow region between a very good flight sim and a you better do your homework flight sim despite what the lesser experienced may believe switch jet can be awesome but the weak link be the generic limit impose on the game this can be experience with the weapon system target aquisition etc be all very much the same when you get down to it i be willing to bet that if ed begin dcs by focus on a single plane it would be the great sim surpass falcon because one plane mean refine all other area but in dcs there be too much ground to cover but hey i appreciate what it be so heres my point the big kahuna play bms or falcon for the first time and you will not have a clue as to the reference of realism either way you will be mesmerize play dcs for year then go to falcon eh hem you will be lose now play falcon for year go to dcs and you will basically be able to figure it out of course after learn keybinding you will start mess with avionic and ah i see what they do there meh ok so ya look falcon be what separate the boy from the man when you be part of a virtual squadron who have real life f 16 pilot who appreciate the realism of the game there be no argument crewchiefs comnav and ew troop in virtual squadron who testify down to the mfd menu radar hud symbology technical order specification on and on i mean cmon in its own realm falcon be far from perfect though but all i can say be if you wanna have a highly acceptable and fun combat flight sim experience then dcs be well within par i love it but if you wanna go from highly acceptable to down right prison rule school pick up bms in the word of forest gump that s all i have get to say about that,pos

do you want to spend 67 of your time play this game wait to respawn or sit through ridiculous loading time the boi howdy this game be for you let us walk through what its like to play hero and wait time you load up the game not bad then you ready up and look for a match after 20 second acceptable of search for a match you find one now you wait 30 second to join the game ok this be weird ahh finally we be in oh wait a 70 second countdown timer wow ok this suck ok you have get a snack and cut the lawn look like the game just start aw man you diede no problem just respawn on this truck travel to location the heck just let me spawn 12 minute later jebus this be excessive you die again just respawn in the spawn zone so you do not have to travel to location pick up weapon alright wtf fine just go try the assault game mode ok ok not bad oh wait what s this wait for 4 team member to fall that s it i be f do close game and delete seriously unless you have the patience of a stoned water buffalo do not even bother with this game you will die of old age before you enjoy it,neg

ignore playtime i have play much more outside steam version bring moba game to third person this make the game much more enjoyable to me as i really do not fancy playing from the sky smite also use wasd or equivalent to control your character so i feel like i actually control the character unlike in lol or dota where i feel like just command the character ability be locate in number so it feel pretty natural to use them smite also offer different gamemode than the 3 lane push it have few more casual mode such as arena which be fun to play and to test character as the game be fast and short game also have few other gamemode but i will not go into them anymore overall smite be moba easy to start due to control i think it offer good deal for unlock all character future update too for 23 99 which be really good price if you do not want to grind to unlock game also have skin some can be bough with in game credit some need real money which be pretty usual in todays moba game,pos

i have always be a fan of card game but this one be very punishing to new player the short end of it be when you start the game everyone else have well card than you and for the most part even if you outplay them and make good decision their card be just significantly strong than yours so they outvalue what you have arena be okay because it take most of this away but then again it seem like people get more legendarie and rare than you do in arena i be almost level 30 and i still lose around 75 of my game the only fair match i seem to have be against new player like myself who do not have an extensive collection of card i do not think this game be bad but you definitely have to play a lot to be able to compete with other player i also mostly play casual where i get match up against people who have be play for a very long time so that may be different than if i play ranked i love watch youtuber like cvh and justinlarson play this game and how creative they can be when craft deck but then i realize that it be ultimately impossible for me to create an ideal deck when i have such a minimal collection maybe in time i will get enough gold to be able to get a collection worthy of beat player who have be around for a long time but until then i be go to continually lose all of my game unless i be play against new player or long time player use trolly deck edit invest even more time into the game and it be still pay to win after 100 hour i still lose to everyone because they have well card so frustrating,neg
early access reviewbasically robocraft be quite a nice game but it really have some issue now there be go to be enough review with pro and con and the like so let me make this short there be only 2 reason this game get a no from me currently 1 there use to be a time be rail heli be niche hard to properly create and play but they be fun and really useful in the right hand too your rail be rather unprecise due to the bob up and down of the rotor blade mean in order to aim properly you have to act against the bob add an additional layer of skill to actually play a competitive rail heli even then you trade some of your accuracy for mobility now though in a real fight you can expect lot of freak misfire that just hit the ground 20 meter away from be the red dot be speak of which what the frick do i need a red dot for if it be not relate to the spot i will be hit at all i already have a reticule to make this issue weird i can not recreate this problem in the training mode at all 1500 ft and i still get 5 out of 6 shot on a target more than half a map away all while move up down and across the map maybe they be cause by be damage i do not know but it be annoying and the accuracy loss during fight be way too big i still can play my rail heli that use to kickhalfway decently but the constant freak misfire which be not directly my fault and can not be prevent by anything aside from get another bot type be take a lot of fun out of the game it just will not feel right and yeah that as an airborne player be still a large issue than flak cannon or the like to me 2 the score of the win team have be double aka carry scrublord exceptional player on lose team if just they would change those 2 thing this game would get a full recommendation from me and i would sink a lot more time into this game too as long as those be there thank but no thank edit 21 06 2016there be a lot of nice new feature like smart weapon and stuff it be actually quite nice aside maybe from whiner acommodation aka flak and i really want to get hype again for this game but my personal playing niche have be completely kill off and since it be still as dead as it get my review stay negative,neg

you can say whatever you want but those dev really care about their game at everyone who would compare newz to any other infestation game i would simply tell you that you can not game be unique dev be active anticheat be ultra decent and community can be friendly at some point i be the first one point out some default of the game and the fact it can be boring if you play the same thing over and over again but there be multiple game mode and a lot of thing to do to avoid get it become bore the only thing i can say be go to chill around some stream youtube video or even on the forum and you will clearly want to test the game oh yeah i be go to forget but support be really active too and it be enjoyable,pos
i do not know where to start this be the first time i feel the need to write a review i spend 30 minute read review on forum and here in steam 80 90 negative and that comme from player with 2k to 7k hour spend on the game about the last patch and as someone who have play this game since dota 1 i have see a lot of change some be good and some ofcourse not but you could have get along with them and even start to like them however this last update 7 00 be not like them it completely change everything to add so much new thing in one time it be so unbalanced and with the tree skill every hero be different now the support be carry and the carry support it be like i have no knowledge of the game about the visual the new hud be really small keep in mind many people play on standart laptop size 15 6 and the health bar be hard to watch when it be on the bottom instead on top of the skill bar it will really be good if after all the change you get the option to adjust all of those for example to expand the hud like the map size i would like as many other the new update to be a new game like dota 3 so a lot of people have the option to play the last game patch 6 88 we all like but i know this will not happen unless a lot of people leave the game or professional player do not say something if the idea of this update be to draw more people to the game keep in mind be it worth it and will they be more than the one leave it i personally will not be play it unless some drastic change take place which most likely will not happen,neg
early access reviewi ve be play this game on and off for two or three year now and here what i feel about the gamein the beginning there be creativity i would fight other bot that resemble badfuturistic tank air and ground walker and bot that ressemble creation out of movie like star war or halothere be balance in chasis cube and i do not mean just the cube i also mean armor you would see decent build with a little bit of armor for protection and overall have a balanced fight in a matchhowever i have start to play again for a few match and i be up to find some of the keything that make this game fun be while not go slowly be use less than they originally werei see more armored turtle with gun poke out in a match then i see a decently build creative cool look battle machine these day and i think that be mostly because armor have get far too important in build a robotnothing seem to be balance anymore in term of creativity and building balance of cube and its really upsetting because this be and still can be a really fun game to play and i do not want to see it go down the tube just because the development team do not do anything to bring the creativity back that stuff on the new cover for the game be never see in a real match because if it be it would be incinerate by hover build cover head to toe in armor the creativity to make robot be still very much in the game but the match themselves make it impossible to win with these creative bot because they get destroy by these other robot that be cover in part so high in defense that they shread you to piece before you can do some damage so if the development team s ever read this then please do something about balance out these part so that it be not impossible to win a game creativly and to the people read this review i say to give robocraft a try its not a bad game it just can be frustrating at time but if you find you re always get frustrated and always get destroy in match then i would reccomend to just play something else and stay update on robocraft to see if the dev fix these problem that have be occur and if you do not feel like wait then i be sorry robocraft have disappoint youthese be just my opinion on the game so please do not harass or synically bash me over the head through the internet because i be try to helpful while still positive for a game i really want to pull through,pos

product receive for freeedit 22 nov 2018 wow just wow if you be here for ship to ship combat i get to say that wow do it better sorry but it be true edit 27 may 2018 i have almost 1200 hour in game why do i keep do this to myselfedit with about 850 hour play at the time of this edit clearly i be not pay attention to my own negative recommendation i do enjoy the game and recommend it to anyone play wot as the next step in tank combat game wot feel pre pubescent in comparison if you want air combat or to blast people with tank or both try this out many thing have change in war thunder since i begin good and bad but i keep come back the gui be still garbage but i know how it work now i be go to keep my recommendation negative because wt be very hard for new player to get into what follow be my first impression after about 4 hour of play yay plane yay tank boo matchmaking balance boo one of the most unintuitive guis i have ever see it be fun the first few match the matchmaking system be merciful and take pity on the noob suddenly once you get a plane that happen to not be a biplane regardless of whether you select a biplane to begin with matchmaker decide that you be an elite ace pilot and make sure to never disappoint you by give you any match that be too easy or fair i can not for the life of me figure out this interface either if i want to do something like change a crew from plane 1 to plane 2 i apparently need to go buy some sort of manual for the game come from certain other free game of this variety i just can not tell what they be think when they design this thing if i want to play in a match full of biplane it seem i must send any high tier plane on holiday and then go into the match so i do not get place in a game with jet fighter by accident problem if i mysteriously decide i would like to fly a high tier plane i have send on holiday i must do some sort of re purchase of the crew as if they would all die in a barracks fire or perhaps choke to death on their bloody tea and crumpet while i be out can i decide which crew go to which plane seem not i like the gameplay i absolutely abhor the gui matchmaking need help enter at your own risk godspeed edit after over 200 hour i be still learn new thing about this gui stockholm syndrome have set in i see the reason they have do thing in particular way but there be still a ton of room for improvement i still can not really recommend the game unless you be at least mildly masochistic come join me in the darkness but do not say i do not warn you,neg

early access reviewpretty decent f2p game you can not pay to become op you can only buy skin weapon be permanent too even though you can aim down the sight in most case it be well not to the game be close to csgo than cod netcode be decent too wepon balance be just fine there be no clearly op weapon in the game most gamemode be restrict to gun only but in battle match you can use killstreak too which be pretty fun and make the game chaotic without sacrafice balance i say give it a go you have nothing to lose and it be easy to sink into the gameplay and have fun,pos
early access reviewgood game competitive meta be same as any ccg where people see something win a tourney and they netdeck to rank up game be a lot of fun and scratch the m tg itch better than m tg ever do itself easy to play f2p my only gripe be that some of the art be a bit too cartoony like hearthstone get to give it to m tg for their amazing artwork and that the competitive meta get stale in between set release if this game have official torunament support i could easily see eternal become a big contender to dethrone magic and hearthstone than it already be,pos

early access reviewi recommend this game only if you want a more accessible and enjoyable version of mtg after collect most of the card the game have to offer and after play gwent i have come to realize that both eternal and mtg be too often decide by luck and very little by strategy you start with 7 card let say you get lucky and start with this hand 3 be mana 1 card cost 1 2 card cost 2 1 card cost 3 and you draw all the right card in most case you have just 1 viable play to make honestly i feel that a large starting hand be require to call it a deep strategy game after the fun of collect most of the card be over i get bore quickly after log in each day even after the new set this boredom do not seem to go away,pos
i recommend this game because it be really fun and do not frequently frustrate me beyond limit favourite feature like how you can bring your house with you anywhere you go instead of run a mile away from your house and then have to backtrace and maybe even lose it you can really explore beyond limit on this game least favourite feature this may just be my friend and my opinion but i think that some item be ask for too much material to be craft or too rare material i suppose it will keep you search and explore maybe this be not a bad feature for some but sometimes i just give up on try to find item i rate this 8 10very good and addictive fun to play with friend and to compete for well item house and much more,pos

i see a lot of people complain about the payment yes it be irritating yes it be a pay to win aspect but honestly this game atleast let you gain everything through in game cash which be actually rare these day i have play it for a few hour with some friend and honestly i have have a really great time even though i be not a member thinking of buy a 3 month membership soon because of me find it fun my general idea of the game so far be 1 fun to play with friend not that fun alone2 payment be not always optional3 ammo can run dry quickly when play aroundin my opinion the game could be a one time payment and then you could buy everything permanently for in game cash but this be not how it be though as i say if you do not want to pay for the 15 wayfarer starter pack or the 3 month membership you may have a bad time,pos
there seem to be a lot of negative review on steam about this game especially revolve around the pricing structure and while i agree that the price look quite high i have to say that i think the item be so good that to me they be worth the outlay you get what you pay for and the quality here outshine any misgiving regard price graphically it be stunning especially with everything turn high and run at 60fps with 22 car on the track for which i be refer to dtm experience but the hot lapping in the base game with ai turn on give you an insight into what the finished game will feel like and in my opinion they have get it spot on i can only assume that the base game be yet to be optimise because i get low fps on the same track with only a couple of car out than i do with the 22 car in a full race of dtm same graphic setting for both but with a 10 fps drop in the base game sound be incredible i have never be so engross in the sound of any game as this one and play with headphone on just highlight the beauty of these car gameplay be great especially on the get real setting althought the ai need a little bit more speed as its currently too easy to catch and overtake i be currently use a razer sabertooth gamepad and once setup it work perfectly but i can only imagine how much more fun a steering wheel would make this and it be the game which will likely push me to make that commitment it be that good that i have buy pretty much most of the buyable stuff except for a couple of livery option within just a few day of try it edit may 26th 2016after have set myself up with some decent hardware to get the most out of drive game i can say that this be my favourite driving experience on the pc i own most if not all of the pc racing sim but there be something about raceroom that make it very special to me and that be the feeling you get from the overall atmosphere that this sim create from the sound to graphic to drive feel once set up correctly this be such a cool experience with ai that can keep up and give you a thrilling racing experience,pos

the game be solid i have about 38 hour on my steam account but i have play the game for about 200 300 hour before it be on steam it be a good game you can check its undeniable quality among good review around but it have serious issue that still have not be resolve after all these year the faction balance be very poor in regard of the vanu they be always and it be be consistent for 3 to 4 year more numerous than any other faction which make it almost impossible to win big battle against them or even small skirmish since they have the most veteran of the game edit i re try the game for the first time since a few month and i fight and die instantly against swarm of vanu player that have 20 30x more time in the game than me so around 4000 gaming hour each the game be now half empty and the player leave seem to be all lvl 2000 3000 vanu veteran that will murder you without give you a single chance of find fun in the game just so it be clear you can not properly play solo to the game if you be not with a considerable team it be extremely complicated to join big squad for large battle on the fly plus there be not really any chain of command so order either get lose or it be pure chaos which can be fun util you go back to my first point you can not win against vanu if you do not organize your assault properly sure you be go to have some great moment if you try just to play alone even in large scale assault but they be not go to be enough to outgrow the constant frustration the f2p model be not quite f2p sure you can stick to it and not spend a single penny on the game and you should fare just ok but it bring an even more massive problem the progression be terribly slow it be fun to fight and get point to spend in new skill weapon vehicle aerial and terrestrial upgrade for your shield for the ammo you can carry for the weapon of your vehicle etc until you realize that you need the same type of currency win in game to unlock them all you can not get say currency without play a lot if you be outrageously lucky and proactive you can get up to 200 250 point in an hour of gameplay but this be barely enough for two or three level of any kind of upgrade and i be not even mention weapon which can cost a few thousand and not be worthwile or be completely unfairly strong you can get these point a lot faster by pay the premium fee plus a few other bonus the game be not p2w but consider the really really really useful and advantageous nature of the upgrade you can get for everything in the game player who pay get a lot strong a lot faster finally my last point concern the state of the server it be actually pretty good with a little twist this be a massive scale fps making battlefield look like a claustrophobic nightmare therefore for the server to pick up the information come out of your pc to transmit it to the server and to do the same with every other character and object in the game that take a gargantuous amount of bandwidth if your connexion be not top notch top tier top whatever you want you will be gravely disadvantaged a lot more than in any other fps in comparison i have a pretty lousy connexion at the moment which be new to me but i fare just well in rainbow six siege in ps2 though i be barely more than a move meatbag with a shoot me sign on his back so tl dr all in all planetside 2 be a good game if you do not mind pay for the premium access or if you be really patient if you have large team like a guild or something like that to play with at all time if you be lucky on the amount of vanu against you and if your connexion rock this game be a must but without all that it be go to give you a hard time pretty much all the time try it it be free after all and make your own opinion on the game,neg
never think this be go to be my first steam comment as a mid range control deck player i hate this game so much the balance be awful sometimes i can not stand it any longer as i usually do because the new set of card be ridiculous just pick one card like avigraft it be so overpower and overpush and the influence requirement be low also the backfire be nothing meaningful at all one card can can be use as a kill spell and a forever lockdown at 3 mana power cost only with a slight backfire compare to ciywide ban avigraft be on a completely different power level since i do not tend to be a copy deck cat cancer meta deck player i do not think i will stay in this game if nothing be go to change to conclude this be a good card game with small issue,neg

the gameplay be good but not very competetive my great issue with the game be the terrible support and the unstable build only usable guide be make by fan extensive issue when even the slight problem occue during setup phase i can not change the re outside of a battle and when i change inside a battle it cause the game to blackscreen an issue persist after restartee the entire game and try to join a new battle and when i try to verify game integrity it lack about 6000 file some of which it could not re download due to not have the privilage to gain miss file and i re instal the game just 12 an hour ago tl dr decent casual game terrible build and stability,neg

i have like fallout shelter since it be release on ios however since i do not use my phone too much regularly it be a pain to play it due to it be a game you kind of have to watch throughout every day the game be port to steam be 10x easy on me to remember to check it because i use steam at least once a day fallout shelter be a sim like game base on the fallout series you take the role of the overseer of a vault and must keep thing like food water power and happiness up for your vault dweller on top of that you must make it so dweller can survive attack from raider and creature with armour and weapon even though you can pay for micro transaction it be not need because you get a few of them near the start of the game that will help you with weapon supply armour pet and vault dweller to help out the survival of your vault i would give fallout shelter a 8 10 as a nice little time waster,pos
i can not believe this be free this game be amazing it tell you everything about the gun when you take them apart and put them together it give you hint name of the part when you click on them the control be easy to learn and teach you step by step on how to move forward if you love gun or like to learn about them then get this game can not stop play it,pos

early access review o i use to highly recomend this game now with the new loot system loss of a tech tree and lack of block teir there be really no reason to play it if you play it for an while you will get everything you need or want or you can just pay for it sadly it look like the money man win out with this game they get rid of all the good stuff so little kid can just hop on and get everything they want or buy what they want if you want a game that will challenge you to build a machine that take time effort and game knowledge your look at the wrong game now this have go over to the kiddy freemium side it be a great game that make you want to work to unlock well gun wheel and armor now you can just get the good item in the game if you do well in a match i leave after the huge bot update that have everyone hidde behind the big bot in the front because it get really boring like cod get you just shoot back and forth until you kill the medic bot behind the huge bot so i leave and now when i come back hope to find that they even thing out and maybe add a few more game mode i sadly find a great game have be gutte inorder to make more money it kind of seem like the game manager go on vacation leave the money man and the scripter to go nut while there be some new funish macanic there be now a lack of any restriction want a sniper medic aa bot sure why not kid have fun we use to have to carefully craft our machine for a role like defender attacker wall tank you name it we have to come up with a solution on how to fill that roll we only have so many bot to make before they charge us for it make us carfully construct our machine now you get as many slot as you want and can go bot happy while i do like that they use a workshop allow you to use other poeple bot design as long as you have the stuff for it that be a small plus in all of the new negative aspect of this game,neg

my review of hero general aka thing i like and thing i do not like let us start positive thing i like it be a free online ww2 shooter it have character customization that be not too unrealistic except for some weapon skin it have everything you would expect different weapon vehicle 3 faction and different class progression they give out the odd free item shooting be enjoyable i only try 2 weapon though there be weapon and character upgrade thing i do not like it be a free online ww2 shooter so expect bad team player connection server issue premium currency and premium status that grant a bonus to xp basically make you unlock well weapon quicker quite unfair your starting gear as the us an m1 garand that be it you have to level up to unlock a knife pistol grenade you know thing every soldier have that be not really as handy as a rifle ultimately this make match so god damn dull i never once think i would begin to get bored of the m1 garand sound but when all you hear be puff puff ping puff puff puff ping ping for an hour straight it will drive you mad battle be really empty so much so it seem too quiet to be a battlefield again dull wow i can change the colour of my helmet and the colour of my uniform but wait i will only ever see it in the menu what be the point hell when change helmet the display do not even update i have great internet connection play a lot of multiplayer match in other game not one issue this game rubberbande every 15 in second i play almost 2 hour and it be infuriate literally no other game i own have that issue save up for that one class you want be not go to make the game any better i have just about have enough of the connection issue and decide to play until i could afford to play as a paratrooper band of brother style do not help very disappointing animation for the character and the plane not to mention you can get shoot out of the sky by anyone with a gun who look up and save up for that character end up give me less option to customise stamina system for a soldier you really can not ing run far the general part you have to put a lot more hour in than i do i love strategy game and i have play thousand of hour of them on here and i be 100 sure i would have be disappoint with that mode too most thing in the trailer screenshot barely happen and obviously be set up except for that stupidcycle every time i see a german tony hawk i focus fire on his sillyas he struggle to turn the damn thing drive remind me of garrys mod addons i really want this game to be at least decent and satisfying and although i win almost every match i play i be still disappoint would not recommend i would prefer to buy my friend any brother in arm game instead of waste their time with this cheap trash,neg

early access reviewthe game can be fun obviously i have play it a lot but it be be develop by a terrible company with very unprofessional staff you can and will be ban for ask question on support ticket which be where i assume we be suppose to do that they actually have a support policy that say they will ban you for longer if you ask a question i be ban for use naughty word to another player in chat when i contact support and show them a screenshot of this player threaten me i be literally tell to be quiet and do not ask question or be ban longer try it but do not give them your money and whatever you do never contact the support staff,neg
i will start with requirement forget requirement in description those be for old client right now you need high end game equipment to play this game smooth and nice or you will need to run in potato mode somebody mention it early multiplayer be laggy bad part be when you be in the middle of opperation or just take off from airport and somebody connect to server allready dozen time happen that crash happen because so much lag i do not mind ai it be pretty decent if you want to learn and practice use low setting if you be up to more challenge make the ai level high and if you be hardcore just join some pvp multiplayer the simulation level be marvellous you can actually fly modern military aircraft which be mostly impossible to ever fly for most people on the earth lack of finish on most recently release model can be frustrating but it be a well learning curve for newbie you do not have whole plane to learn but in part by part i be not really into helicopter and ww2 or cold war period plane but for modern i must say they be awesome get a decent hotas grab at least gtx 1070 but i recommend 1080 vr headset and get ready for some amazing experience,pos
by the egg a fine battle for reason unknown i be enjoy this far more than i ever do hearthstone perhaps it be the refined mature art style perfect for a gentleman like me perhaps it be the class system and abundance of card provide just the right amount of freedom and choice whilst not feel overwhelm the business model seem fair as well get ready for the face smashing grind against ai if you want to accrue craft gem as a free to player though i have even have my fair share of fun creating deck to deal with the a i all in all it be not another hearthstone clone for me it be a well game and a fair one at that psst i have already spend 5,pos
this be not actual yu gi oh this game follow a speed duel format which completely change the game instead of 8000 lp you have 4000 lp instead of 5 monster spot and 5 magic trap spot on each player field you be limit to 3 instead of 40 card deck you can only choose 20 30 card you also draw less card at start of the match all these change combine mean the same old card now perform completely differently than you would remember pay 1000 lp to activate an effect be 1 4 of your lp instead of 1 8th also all of your old deck literally can not be build as the deck space cap be now low than the previous deck minimum so what exactly be the motivation to play this game i can not use any of my old combo i can not build my old deck and most of the card i remember have not even be add to the game yet i can not recommend this game in any way shape or form,neg
update 17 oct 2018 a lot of the recent review be negative because of rushed client update on 25 sep 2018 break stuff as of 17 oct 2018 the new patch have fix almost all of them and the game be in a superb state now i play mostly on mobile so my actual playtime should be around 1000 hour and i would like to say that this be the good digital ccg in the market for mobile at least since mtg arena may compete in pc the lane system make the game skill intensive and the limited amount of rng make for a good streamlined game if you play hearthstone and hate the insane rng trust me that this be the game for you there be con ofcourse the mobile client be slow to load and disconnect if your wifi network drop even for a second but a new client be on the horizon and that should clear up these technical issue pretty much the amazing soundtrack art be also a refreshing change from the usual cartoony art comedic soundtrack that you find in every other hearthstone clone out there esl be in no way a clone of hearthstone regard the p2w aspect that other review be complain about you can get a near complete collection with a couple of month invest into the game without spend a dime it will require some grinding but that be expect in any free game especially ccgs tldr good mobile ccg in the market right now if you want to play a ccg that involve skill and have epic art soundtrack,pos

early access reviewedit apparently 20 minute do not justify this review as vaild if we ignore the psychology of make snap judgement and the fact i know what kind of game i like i be go to give a long review base on my short time and explain how i game to my conclusion of not good why i do not feel someone else would enjoy it this do not make me a hater because i really enjoy the 2d adventure quest the gameplay you move with w s and a d turn the camera around behind you you can also move the camera around with the mouse basic click on thing do action base on what say thing be collect loot be annoying with no real feedback on if you actually pick up the loot and you can only pick it up by click on it not by walk over it in my short game time i manage to get through the intro stage and to the main town enough to firgure out the gameplay be fairly standard drivel nothing exicting nothing fun nothing that get me hook i do not really have much to say other than i do not enjoy it the interface it be awful you can tell it be design with mobile in mind and then the interface for mobile be just update to work on pc game can be design to work on mobile and port to pc just fine see timberman that be orginally a mobile game and this game do not do that very well the font be awful and i could notice some of the texture do not scale nicely to 1980 speak of texture the graphic i really like the design and style of the 2d game it look good and have a nice aesthetic to it i be not a graphic over gameplay kind of guy and do enjoy game you could argure have poor graphic proteus for example or moirai however this game be sell itself as a mmo that mean it be hope i will play it loads if that be the guess i be kind of hope for something a bit well it have ps1 esquie graphic and not in the good way i be guess this be because of the fact it be design for mobile the writing story you may feel i can not give a fair review of the story and i would 100 agree with you i be go to talk about it anyway the writing be dire cringe worthy and really unthoughtful you can tell it be not do by someone who know the first thing about write it be not even do in a casual way just bore unfunny unwitty word on a screen it do not hook me in it do not want me to find out more or want me to play it be just bad in summary i find this game bad and i do not enjoy it if you play hour upon hour of the 2d game then this be go to suck and you will not enjoy it if you have never play adventure quest before then who know you may enjoy this but it be nothing like the game it be base on personally save your time and effort and try a different game original review give it 20 minute of my life in those 20 minute i find out it be nothing like the game i waste so many hour in high school in it have lose a lot of charm on the way poorly write cringe worthy joke an intresting feature be that you can play the same game on the pc and your phone eventually do mean the pc verison be scale quite far back do not bother waste your time on it it be free but i would feel insult if i have to spend money to try that out,neg
early access reviewfantastic game with frequent content update play very similar to magic the gathering if you be familiar with that game but take great advantage of the digital medium use a resource system that require you to draw you resource from your deck so there be variance build in where you may have to deal with not draw enough to little of your resource but they be have be good at add game mechanic that help deal with these issue this game be also extremely generous with it be free to play model and it do not take very long at all to collect craft the card you need for competitive deck overall it be a great game and would highly reccommend to anyone look for a fun free to play card game with deep strategy and decision making,pos
in my opinion this be one of the good multiplayer shooter available today there be something for everyone wheter it be tank drive air battle support wether as medic or fungineer platoon squad leader or just walk around shoot people no matter what you do you will fall in love with this game and its community and everytime you boot the game up and join a platoon you will remeber why download and play it now you will not regret it unless you be extremely impatient and can not tolerate death,pos

path of exile have to be one of the most enjoyable rpg game i have play since diablo 2 lot of player will tell you as will i have you sink countless hour into the diablo franchise and be ultimately disappoint by diablo 3 this be the game for you a player since open beta this game have come so far in term of class expansion level development progression and the unique orb reward system which the game economy largely revolve around the 3 month challenge league release by the developer keep this game new exciting and fun while simultaneously introduce new skill gem for awesome monster smash alter the passive tree to keep player build dynamic and fresh and to prevent face roll because let face it path of exile will kill you with 6 different class to choose from and countless character build if you enjoy individualize your character i strongly recommend this game overall i rate path of exile 9 10replay value countless hoursdifficulty hardcore player beware casual player also be warn you will lose 10 exp for every death economy with the introduction of customizable hideout trading be well in need of a more dynamic and integrated trading system orb be awesome double function as a mechanic to alter gear or trade up for well con time investment be huge i e learn how the economy work what can kill you virtually everything if you be not pay attention 24 7 mainstream build do exist in both hardcore and standard league limit to individualization but still doable storyline be lacklustrepros itemization monster synergy skill effect and passive tree design in a unique and fresh way that challenge the way we think rpgs should be play i could go on and on but honestly just download the game look up a build online and give it a shot you will find that you can not stop play take it easy guy and good luck god of warrior,pos

well i can see how people be mad that these gun cost money and that the start game be free however i would like to point out that a lot of these gun be complex also the company probably have to buy one of each of these gun and then find someone qualified to take them apart without fail and damage them and then they would have to either make a 3d model from each and every one of the part so that would be either they would need to take a picture of each and every angle of the part for 3d or they would have to make the part in some kind of 3d art software either way it would not be fun nor easy and you have to take this into consideration also i make up most of the thing about the 3d stuff those be idea of mine as to how that work and i be guess but still to aquire a harpers ferry flintlock pistol that would be hard anyhow i be a gun enthusiast and if you have these gun irl you would know its worth it to know how to take them apart all the way to clean them edit alright i play the game a bit more and i hit the wall there be a problem with this game earn to win system so effectively it be a pay2win free game so basicly look at the dlc and add that cost in and you have the cost of the game still worth it to know about these gun if you have them irl,pos

this be basically a hearthstone rip off will elder scroll lore that do not mean it be bad though list the pro elder scroll legend allow more freedom when it come to deck build no need to restrict yourself to 30 instead you can have a max of 70 card if you want the art be really nice and the plethora of card you can make and get equal nearly unlimited deck building that s mostly where my compliment for this game end this game be not heavy on ptw in my opinion however it be highly rng base you play a 10 minute game successfully put up guard lethal charge those be type of card whatever you may want only to go from about 25 to 30 health to 0 to 10 in a matter of 2 turn people in this game either play extremely defensively to the point that you be fight an indestructable turtle or they play hyper aggressive with lethal and vampire card now that i get the salt out of my system from lose 4 consecutive match with a strength willpower deck to a bunch of agility endurance deck good luck beat them this game be all and all basically just hearthstone with more depth and more freedom if you like that play it oh and this game be free which be nice,pos

yknow i have always enjoy bloon since the first game while this do not exactly play like the previous instalment in the series it be absolutely a welcome change to me basically rather than a hoard of bloon that be set by the computer you play against other attack with your own bloon while try to defend for anyone that be play clash royale it be sooorta like that except this come first i will also bring up how in singleplayer bloon game you have access to every tower you have unlock but in battle the battle last an hour at most so you can only use 3 of your unlock tower and one more random tower this can bring up some interesting combination let you experiment on which one work best many of you may know that there be a mobile version for this game while you probably can not take this version around with you depend on what kind of computer you have this version framerate be much well than the mobile version and due to the use of a mouse and high definition graphic you can place tower in more precise location in the end i do not really have many problem with this game it be a solid multiplayer tower defense however certain function be block by a paywall so look out for that,pos

this game have turn i actuallysomethe out this morning that be lessthan this game true story the game be essentially a ploy to get you to pay them money free research point can not be use unless you have eagle to convert them into usable research point and of course eagles cost money you can happily play through the first tier of plane for each region relatively easily however as the tier progress the goal and upgrade become harder and hard to obtain especially on free to play and thus push you towards get a premium account or pay for game currency when i first start play the game it certainly do not have such an obvious push for cash but as the update have roll on it be show it be money grab side money aside the game be relatively good the arcade mode be most people favourite with realism lower and more emphasis on action there be however two other online mode real battle and simulation the game also offer a single player mode and campaign the gameplay itself have be simplify and allow for control almost entirely through a mouse there be a vast array of aircraft for several different region all of which can be upgrade and to a limited extent customise overtime there be also a multitude of map most contain land sea unit which have to be eliminate along with airfield and basis for more information read a well review than this one,neg

this game be fun you can choose a race class history etc yes there be a in game currency that cost real money and maybe consider pay to win but a they need money to run the game update it etc and b if you like the game why not support it you can have a pet you can create a map once you reach a high enough level overall this game be worth it,pos

the game itself be great however when purchase with gem or real money be careful as you may not receive what you pay for and the customer service will not beleive you if you be play on a steam account as they can not see everything that you do and they will say you receive it even with screen shot,neg
i think it be a very good game it contain the heartstone feel but get even more mechanic the only downside i could find very fast be that if you want to continue the story you have to cash out in my opinion quite allot for so little it be fair that they take payment for more content but i think it be very expensive if you do not like to play against player this be not for you i think but if you do like that then you should try this out also the voice actin be pretty bad especialy in the pay story line for example the storyteller voice have change pls fix bethesda so all in all a very good game that be similar to heartstone but it be a bit expensive when it come to additional content booster pack story line,pos
early access reviewthis game be definitely worth a try for anyone who enjoy counter strike cod4 or any similar old time shooter honesty do not expect much from a f2p but i have be pleasantly suprised with this game there be absolutely no pay to win feature unless for some reason you consider cosmetic pay to win the map be small but balanced to those complain about sniper the map be clearly split into different area with different lane there be a cross map lane for sniper and usually along the left and right hand side of the map there be a cqc or rifle range area for those who do not enjoy snipe the game be extremely fast paced and the match be not long so it be a pretty relaxed enjoyable game to play,pos

early access reviewalright so this game start off as kinda like a pubg ripoff but with its own unique twist and not just some blatant copy as time grow on it start to establish itself as a new and different battle royale but yet retain the core fundemental gameplay as all the other it force you to be tactical and a quick mover without get catch up in looting while also loot enough so you good stand a chance in a firefight i love this game for its unique twist on the battle royale genre where most game be almost exact copy of each other i have never really be one to have a preference over fortnite or pubg i enjoy both and play them quite a bit at least 40 hour for each i do not neccesarily like how noticeable it be that this game beneath all its beauty be just another pubg copy it be not enough to make me leave just enough to make me a little irritated but you could the same to any battle royale game that out after pubg or fortnite or even h1z1 but it be the point when the battle pass oh sorry i mean the adventure pass again its kinda bound to happen to any battle royale game but i do not like how it borrow stuff from game and sorta turn it into its own the graphic remind me of pubg but seriously the new player skin and the pass just kinda seem like a total ripoff of fortnite now it will not stop me from play it and i hope it will not stop you from play either but its just something to be aware of its a good game and otherwise a great battle royale game,pos

early access reviewyou may wonder be this game a fortnite clone graphic be really similar the game mode be the same both game share so much common ground that some people call realm royale a fortnite clone which be not true realm be a fast paced sort of in yo face action game the game do not require you to gather material the way you do it in fortnite also since player be not allow to build their own fortification skirmish in realm often last less than in fortnite forge be natural hot spot which mean that often you will not have any trouble find trouble in realm just camp a forge for 30 second and you will have people to shoot at realm may be also interesting for those of you who like the paladins universe the game have get a ton of easter egg weapon ability and even place that have to do with certain paladin map just be aware that those similarity be just that easter egg both game play very differently even though realm do have some moba element fortnite be a world apart from realm it feature a slow pace there be more camping though when it come to skirmish fortnite give you a lot of freedom to quickly transform the battlefield to your convenience just like in minecraft most of the time your victory depend on how fast you build rather than on how good your aim be neither it require you to tailor your strategy accord to your class ability and yout teammate class and ability if you like paladin or ow there be a huge chance you will find realm royale way more appealing than fortnite,pos

this game be absurdly biased towards the russian vehicle i would not recommend it to anyone base on the fact that the developer will not admit that and choose to cite sekret russian dokument as the reason why russian vehicle be so absurdly op a prime example be the new tu 4 a russian copy of the american b 29 with large engine cannon and payload capacity but be be impossible to shoot down compare to the b 29 which can be shoot down simply by look at it instead of remove the bias from the tu 4 they bump it up to a 7 0 br from a 6 3 br this do absolutely nothing as the game horrible match make as of late will still put the 7 0 tu 4 against the 6 3 b 29 which may as well be make of card stock do not play this game unless you want to play russian vehicle and be hate by everyone you will get addicted and angry and be post a review of why people should not play this game,neg

early access reviewso i have to change my original review right now i be not recommend a game that be once great the problem epic loot really like if i want to have more piece to keep build i either have to pla a match to get las 20 random piece which where no the one i need or i can sell the one i already have like wait be not i go to use those piece to build if you get to be in the first position at the end of the match great for you hey you get a rare loot but what about tge people who do not care for the first place and just want to have some fun so this be just my opinion i will say good bye to robocraft for a while have fun guy just get rid of it back to war thunder,neg

i get this game with a friend because we be bore and i be not disappoint it be true it be not a perfect game but it be free atleast pro this game be fun when you play with friend or alone survival open world if you want to challenge yourself more open world be more pvp base because you can find at the start of the game a lot of gun and hunger thirst bar degenerate at a super slow rate in comparison with survival mode the map be big i only play two caliwood and colorado i do not know if there be more map caliwood be just a city buty it be a decently big map on which you can play on tip if you do not want to get kill get on less populated server common sense duhhh i recommend play survival first so you can get use to conserve ammo and food also you can learn the map colorado or caliwood depend what you be play and you can learn about some exist item in the game too in open world you can find item way more easily rather than in survival mode con bad map make just be careful where you walk i get stick in a bus once if you get stick just get something to kill yourself with a grenade or something almost non existent character customization depend if you care about look or not there be a few glitch or bug here and there but i do not mind them because they do not ruin the gameplay they be actually kind of funny xd clan can be make only on open world and also they set up only for the specific character you have select and it kind of suck friend too but that only when inside a server you can not make lobby so that you and your friend spawn in the same area load time take a long time like 15 second it spawn you in the game before you join the server so you may join already dead if you do not disconnect in a good spot,pos

as far as clicker game go this one be absolutely garbage the pace of progression be slow and awkward the variety of foe be minimal at good for whatever reason you can customise your character and have it stand on the side of the screen for no real reason other than aesthetic value which the game already lack with the trashy interface of a constantly glitchy and unintuitive upgrade menu give this a miss,neg
  the new update just ruin this game really bad progress in this game be still just mindless grinding farming and chase after nothing now with extra step in the recent update the shadow tower be completely unbalanced and overdone some low floor be even hard than high floor which make no sense at all and then trion increase the boss health too much to the point that every boss fight be a long boring and competitive run and hit fight furthermore this update make class way too unbalanced melee class become weak and nearly turn into useless class in shadow tower on the other hand range class such as gunslinger or shadow hunter be become more powerful in shadow tower like every group must have at least 1 gunslinger and 1 shadow hunter i use to enjoy help new player dash through hard shadow tower with my 16k class but now i can not even help myself to get through the first wave of the last two floor in hard mode and normal mode be now like ultra mode to newbie i have to say it be ridiculous seiously trion only focus 20k player in this update and overally ignore newbie and anyone who be progress to the end game to be honest you gain very tiny reward compare to your many hour of mindless grinding and hard work because the whole game be base on rng and rng and rng in every single thing do not waste your time on this game find something else to play because you will not progress anything except if you pay because that be what trion want you to,neg

early access reviewi have wait long enough to review this and with the release of the new card set i feel i can finally do so with accuracy to put it simply this game have promise but right now it be just too imbalanced to be truly enjoyable a ranked game get you match against almost the exact same one or two deck over and over i be look at you rakano armory because everyone know they have the strong combination of card and if you be not play those like everyone else you mostly just lose with the occasional lucky win due to power and removal draw if you be just look for something to play casually and pass the time for 5 10 minute by all mean go for it but do not get too into it until the game have have some more development and polish it at least play like a true free to play game with lot of reward so there be that,neg
this be pretty awesome i be no full time fps fanatic infact i think this be my first game of this type of pvp shooter and i be hook i would not like to go in this game alone as it be massive and i still get to grip with everthing but its such good fun and i be already get my fair share of kill that be work with another more experienced player the different type of character you can play be awesome which give the game such variety i be enjoy the medic for level but i be actually enjoy him and get kill with my new gun also the max take on pretty much anyone and anything even at lowish level not sure about the community have not be in a squad yet have not be harrase by anyone verbally but as any be your go to get your fair share of idiot highly recommend great fun,pos

early access reviewi absolutely can not recommend this game the developer be beyond incompetent adventure quest 3d be a perpetually unfinished mmo despite multiple update with add class area item etc the game still only have one town which would be fine if that town be actually complete it be not not even close and with recent news that they be re develop the combat system i be convince they will never finish it they have no interest in provide a complete experience only flash shiny bauble in your face to distract you from the half complete game they expect you to want to pay for,neg
early access reviewgreat collectible card game in the vein of magic the gathering and hearthstone that be as free to play as you want it to be highly recommend for fan of the genre,pos
early access reviewconnection issue aside this be a very generic mmo if you have previously play blade and soul black desert online aion or revelation online you have already play a much well game than bless go show your support there this game have a long way to go before it catch up to any of those and its already be out for year,neg
early access reviewnow i be very hopeful go into this knowing full well that it be a very early access copy adventure quest world be one of the more entertaining browser game i ever get to play as a child and i be very curious to see just how that would translate into a modern 3d image as a whole however i still find myself disappointed just not for the reason you would think i the combat and the controls1 the combat i personally have no quarrel with the control or the combat style of the game keep in mind that the game design be true cross platform if i have to comment on it it be not a very good idea to have everything limit as though it be a mobile only game what do this mean well the hud be exactly what you think it be four to five button on the bottom right corner detail your different abilite of which there be really only four for every class as the fifth button be your auto attack and your health and mana bar both of which seem very insignificant as unless you be head into very high level territory there really be not anything that can pose a threat to you not to mention it seem next to impossible to run out of mana unless you be fight a boss mob as someone who be play on pc it be not that i be expect ton more from a game that be program to work on a cell phone however it still feel like artix particularly focus on the mobile aspect now i can only imagine this will change in the future when the dev have have more time to properly work on the game for now however it feel like the only thing that be keep personal computer user in mind be the fact that there be a controll scheme set up for them speak of which 2 the control again i have no major complaint here save for the fact that they be far too simplistic for a game like aq i do expect more than just click to interact and press a button to attack at least outside of their 2d game which even then have more interactive capability than this this be another case of the game be too one sided towards the ios side of the target audience i still think that there will be improvement and it would be unfair of me to not give the developer time to do so however it be still upsetting that it feel like the game be release into beta far too early give that they desire to capture the attention of two separate user let us take a look at some other aspect of the game yes ii the graphicsagain definitely one sided towards mobile user but and a big one too there be no deny that this be almost a necesity i definitely do not find myself complain too much as adavanced graphic for pc user be something that can be integrate in the future like just about everything else that need to be add to the game it be art style be simplistic but still remind me of the aq universe i explore when i be young there really be not anything more i can say about this section really next iii the world itselfhow can i put this gently it be empty like completely empty and almost entirely devoid of npc character that be design to be interact with in battleon the main town in the game that aq be know for i find more hostile npc than anyone to talk to it seem they have many area for the game already design but they have yet to fill them with character that either give you quest to which there be at least one per area shop of which there be next to none especially for low level character that often depend on at least one or two buy so they can last long enough to get armor from grind something rather redundant as the first shop that actually have any of this only sell thing that you can very easily grind for and overall life to the region itself battleon be a town that look like it be abandon in preparation for a full scale war oh do i not mention that all the non hostile npc in the town be just generic guard that can not be interact with i be start to ramble next section iv questsfor a game call adventure quest there really be not that many quest every single one i run into be either a fetch mission or a kill this many of this enemy mission both of which be flaw in a few way fetch mission can be complete far too easily as the item need be literally point out to you meanwhile hunter quest be just the opposite kill this many of that monster okay where be the monster that be it how be i suppose to find it if i do not even know where it be the fact that i run into this exact same predicament at least five time before even end an hour not too good again and i can not really stress this out enough the game be in an extremely early access build so i can not really say i be entirely dissappointed as there really be not much to expect in the first place v conclusionoh we be at the end already that be fast anyway despite all that i have negatively mention i like the way that this game be head i really do think it have potential and i can not truly blame the developer for any of it my final conclusion be that the game be release into its public testing phase far too early essentially there be not really anything to test yet as you can most likely read on the top of this review i have not even play for a full hour and yet i feel like i have already do everything the game currently have available to do artix entertainment have once manage to capture my young feeble heart with the majestic browser game know as adventure quest world even if i do not know what i be do there be enough in it to keep me at least guess what i have to do i would argure that for mobile the game would feel more complete be it not for the fact that i have play full scale mmorpg game in the past on my phone that feel far more diverse than this if i have one suggestion to make to artix it be this do not be afraid to add on to the game right now i have everything on maximum and my computer do not know what be happen as it have never run a game so smoothly before the game be not in the least bit finish much less finished enough for stress testing there be literally nothing to test here guy vi final verdictdo i recommend the game no at least not yet i recommend that you keep an eye on the game and the progress of it be development as i know for a fact that artix be a company if you can really call it that give how few of them there be that like to trully cater to its audience and try their very good to help them out wherever they can but right now the game be not worth playin unless you be test the mobile aspect of it,neg

compare to the majority of previous attemp at make this game what it could of be i believe it have hit close to home have beginner server where it feel like the pvp be equally match as well as a place where new player can experience the overly do amount of loot be great as when you hop on an official server that have high population there be no doubt that you will be pop in moment by a sniper depend on where you be that be a downfall but the majority of the time this can be avoid by just carefully select a server the game mode battle royale be great fun but it feel like a heavy waste of time if you reach the top 10 and do not come in the top 3 i find that i reach the top 10 in a good amount of game only to die before get to the top 3 as people with heavy amount of med can sit in the radiation zone longer when the safezone circle be tiny so they can easily pick you off the pvp server be good if you have already gather a mighty stash worth of gun that you really do not care about lose a lot of game time till these server become viable i believe the warmup server helpful as you do not lose your gear but you do lose your consumable so you need to bring a whole lot of meds ammo for a gamemode where you achieve nothing but warm up overall this type of game be still toxic but a lot well than the previous one and it do seem like it be head in the right direction there be bad part but good counter part,pos
early access reviewthink a massive problem with this game be that the bonus card stick too much they inhance a card too much without be denyable by silence or card change etc it be not display properly in the beginning and it be a poor mechanic anyway,neg
early access reviewthe game be not bad graphic be ok it look and feel like a mobile game and it play that well to i find the game bland and boring no rebindable key way to few graphic option this game be good if you want something really simple,pos
early access reviewsplashsceenlevel complete i have hope for this game but the dev seriously do not care about the player i be refund do not purchase this game in its current state,neg
early access reviewfor starter yes this game be obviously inspire by minecraft as be many other however everything the developer pull off they pull off just right i stop play mc a couple year ago but think i would give this a try it be a suprisingly fresh take on the voxel sandbox style world game that keep come out they take all the good thing people like about mc improve and expand on them whilst remove the feature i do not think most people be ever really fond of in mc overall it be a great game i would easily recommend it and be excited to see what the developer do with this great game,pos
early access reviewbrawlhalla be a fine game it have a small handful of issue but most of them be pretty minor and not worth mention the only one that i feel like actually talk about be how similar the character be one charatcer with a gun weapon feel almost identical to another character with a gun weapon however this issue be not really to big anymore since they have be add more unique move to each character if you want a good 2d brawler i would highly recommend this game,pos
early access reviewthis game be beautifully immersive can really look forward to go c r e a t i v e all while listen to some vaporwave or with friend this game be a playground only thing be i wish it be in french and german keep the work up and oh please add other language i would love to study with this game,pos

early access reviewat first i be hype up but then later i notice the same boring old t that you would typicaly see in the 2d version of the game if you want a cool weapon or armour set get ready to pay with real money because all the cool item require special coin that yes you guess it you have to pay for however to be fair if you ignore the fact that the cool item and armour set require real money the game be kinda fun,neg
early access reviewalmost 10hrs in and it feel so damn good pro fast response time with key input smooth shooting mechanic clean map design great weapon design it be easy to see the difference between the weaponry cool look vehicle balanced class system no real advantage in choose a class over another just a different move ability with different inventory space end game really engaging and different from other brs con optimization could be well on a 1080 and i7 6700 the game struggle to keep 60fps pickaxe class could use a little boost in speed when climb a rock wall climbing make you slow and vulnerable 3d sound design could be improve sometimes it be hard to tell where you be get shoot from 8 10 so far con be not big enough to penalize the game ring of elysium be fully enjoyable fun and can be also competitive i recommend it and the price tag of zero money make it easy to be access by everybody,pos
the trailer be very misleading it have the bad control a and d move the camera not the character graphics areatmatmatmatmatmatm look like a game from mobile this game isatmatmatmatm,neg
early access revieweternal be a fun game except for one thing and it be a big one they need to fix how many or how few power card be draw in a row during a game win or loose a game because all you receive be power card or non power card be not only not fun but there be no strategy involve you get to watch the other player kill you or you get to kill them without much pushback i have not play a day yet where i win or lose due to this issue the game be really fun but extremely frustrating when this occur i have repeatedly leave feedback without any response i can not recommend this game for that reason there be too many other game that be more fun to play these day,neg
my not recomende this game be base solely on the fact that when i play it i like it but now it feel like the maker be try too hard to get more this be one of the many game i have see that be really good when it be simple but start to become less and less fun as it be creator become more greedy i now regret spend ten buck on this free to play game btw one of the prime example of game that be fun but now be not that good be a game for mobile device call pixel gun along with other game like strand deep,neg

early access reviewreally enjoy the game people need to understand that the server be not go to be good at launch no mmo ever be i be glad not all content be not in right now mean they can tweak it all and release it when they feel like it be ready 130 founder and i do not regret it one bit,pos
very very good design i feel tho if they have charge something like 20 bux and have severely limit the pay to win aspect they would have do better at least reputation wise however when it first come out i maxe out my level and come about 70 the max dps with just good grinding from there on its very steep pay to win or be have not play in some time bc of that good game tho i would say it should be redone well graphic new more engaging world and a well loot structure less pay to win,pos
its battle size put battlefield game to shame its a great mmo shooter and anyone who say its p2w well its understandable sure it look very pay to win but the fact be every weapon you can unlock be a side grade to the default one each unlockable weapon be well at one thing than the start weapon like close quater combat or long range combat but none of the unlockable weapon can play greatly in every situation like the start weapon the vanu start lmg the orion be more than enough proofide say deffinetly give this game a try if you have get the space for it on your computer its free so there s nuthing to lose by give it a go its alot of fun be in these massive battle once you know what your do but if your new prepare to die alot,pos
early access reviewhave not play much but i can not continue due to the camera movement as it be make my eye bleed and give me a seizure pro optimise usable fix machine gun in bunkerscon tpp camera movement use gaijin netagent process that run on your pc in the background to update the game poor practice from dev should be use steam update it be possible to disable it from the launcher character movement ui looting balance especially low ammo automatically spawn you somewhere in the map not many setting available 30 playersi understand this be still an early stage for the game but for my view its not playable yet as the camera be a critical part of any game however its not far off from become a decent battle royale especially because its well optimise,neg
i be wot player 8k battle green wn8 and i have play this game at pc i can say new tank gaming experience 7 player at team less nation less tank line fast game mm only 1 no artillery faster 100 crew 6th sense have every crew small map new perk system easy enemy new map new mission modification support steam support terrible control game be create for mobile gaming not for pc gaming less game setting bad graphic less information after battle stupid auto zoom which go to make you sick useless green line before and behind your tank bug with unzoom strange camera near building another craps take from normal wot for example pay to win really ridiculous rng stupid comunnity summa summarum i do not know what should i think this game be maybe good at mobile but for pc gaming be at least weird on the other have there be no arty and mm be only 1 i hope wargaming will add wot at steam too to sum up i can not recommend you wot blitz for pc gaming unfortunately if you like tank try world of tank war thunder or armored warfare definitly not blitz,neg
early access reviewgreat game but need a ton more work do on it before it be a title worth spend any money on though the dev look like they will be deliver that ton more content it need for those complain about the online be hard it be because people play this game on the pc be not use to brawler or the strategy involve in them not many brawler type game for the pc even few have online gameplay one good tip be when one guy have 9 point and the rest of the team be average around 2 then they need to work together to get the point balance again otherwise the guy with 9 point just have to get hit once by the low scorer and accidentally fall off the map whenever his damage be high to keep anyone else from get anywhere near him score wise easy win for anyone who actually read this there be many other tip and trick assosiate with game exactly like this but i be too lazy to list em all just use your head people something that pc gamer have be do allot less of since game capable computer have become easily affordable for the generall public let not end up like console online gaming i write this review in hope that i can inspire well tactic in the player base it be way to easy to win at the moment and it make the game dull review cap high scorer big threat and feed the weak player when damage be high easy win,pos
this game be absolute trash and a truly disgraceful showing from the creator of one of the most prolific wwii flight sim of all time il 2 sturmovik be roughly cut from the same cloth as other flight sim it be hard to explain to those not accustomed to the genre just why this game be a freemium disaster let us put it this way if war thunder be a tactical fps with a realism bent this be what you would get skill perception research upgrade to increase your character ability to spot target in the field start level one eye level two 8 20 vision in your single eye level three basic visual acuity in your one eye level four second eye acquire level five you be no longer legally blind level six you no longer need glass technically level seven you can read skill stamina research upgrade to improve your ability to walk more than five step without collapse in a pool of your own vomit skill weapon handle research upgrade so your character eventually start point his weapon in the right direction skill ammo loading research upgrade to increase your bullet muzzle energy level one be equivalent to the speed of a muscle propel rock skill gunsmithing research upgrade to increase weapon reliability level one handmade in a columbian sweatshop out of string cheese gorilla glue and old sock imagine play a typical fps where everything you do be make to be as outrageously sucky as possible unless you grind hard to fix it yes you be terribly gimp to a completely and insanely unrealstic extent unless you dig around this game grind sink research tree mean no matter how good you be at flight simme your character be cripple by nonsense like this your plane will handle like a brick with wing in kind unless you level up and this be a free to play game so you know what that mean yep the game be an absolute insufferable grind design to bleed you dry the carrot dangle from a stick be the prospect of play an actually decent flight sim with real live human player the reality your ability to compete be objectively crippled unless you pay to get your artificial stat to some degree of parity with other player war thunder try to conceal its miserable grind sink under a veneer of realism you see your character need to build up his tolerance to g force that be why if you make the slight attempt to turn you lose all control of your ship of course it make sense and of course you need a level whatever blank otherwise your plane will overheat stall out and generally fall apart the instant you engage in combat above cruise speed i be sure in wwii they make plane out of rusty scrap and throw 400 pound diabetic in the cockpit that be why this game be so true to life it be free so you have get nothing to lose by try it all i be try to do be keep you from waste your time however if you do find the game to be an obnoxious mess of a cash grab like i have i implore you not to judge the sturmovik series too harshly the real game in that series be nowhere near as terrible as this be,neg

early access revieweternal manage to be a great compromise between the accessibility and digital interface of hearthstone and the complexity and deckbuilding of magic while the game do not manage to avoid the grinding issue hearthstone have primarily due to expensive deck define legendarie it be pretty generous with give out free stuff in the form of gold and pack the digital nature of the game be exploit wonderfully in mechanic that could never work in a physical card game like magic and way that would probably be too complex for hearthstone which tend to use its digital nature mainly to produce rng effect overall eternal be a great card game with a lot of competitive promise though currently hold back a little by the limited pool of card available oh and if my 20 attack creature could stop take half a year to finish it be attack animation that would be great too,pos
well since i write my review they have add ridiculous amount of garbage to the game they definitely have brainstorming session for how to come up with new item and even category of item to add to the game this way they can sell you a new card tab and an essence tab etc they have lose sight of what make the game good it go from a game with the good loot to one of the bad 99 of item that drop be now garbage it be bad enough that they expect people to buy more and more tab to deal with their hyper inflation of item type and category but they do not even care that we also have to sort all this junk do they realize that they be make the game tedious even if i be filthy rich and i could buy 10 000 tab why would i want to sort that many item this utter disrespect for the time of their customer just so they can make as much money as possible have earn them this negative review strawberry field forever because greed original review several year ago the true diablo 2 because it understand the good part of diablo 2 how to make the powerful armor weapon feel distinct and their effectiveness and useability unique and not just different numerical value amazing game until you reach end game then you start to see how the free to play model do actually influence gameplay design and how the player be expect to become a gambler and hoarder to continue enjoy the game inventory space however the game be free and the skill system give you hundred thousand of hour of nerd or ga sm ic do not censor this volvo because that make it unintelligible experimentation with new character so i must recommend it,neg

early access reviewthe game use to be amazing now it be just an annoying pay to win grind the concept be unique build your own type or robot but over time the concept have be ruin with new update that progressively degrade the game for example change the leveling up system be the big feature for me that i absolutely hate they add some sort of crate loot system and sell item be the only way to gain any currency this game use to be fill with a fun fair leveling system but this new pay to win make so many thing be so unbalanced and it feel like only the rich can really benefit out of this game i have try to love the game so hard many time but it go to a point where it be just too ridiculous if the developer can please restore the past feature of the game it would be so much well edit i may not have be clear about a couple of thing that be change from before and after,neg

afk simulator afk heaven whole team afk but joke aside this game need to do something about afker that sometimes can be your whole team everything else be mostly good except for matchmaking which quite awful at time and put in immposible situation and game turn into a one shot central and that be why it be such a shame to see this game get otterly ruin by the vast number of afk player i be loose intrest to play this game because of that and can not recommend anyone to play this afk simulator one other issue i find out be the massive flaw in matchmaking game put up team that be heavily underpowere against a much high tier setup in this scenario enemy tank be basically invincible and everyone just sit back in spawn and wait for the game to end,neg
early access reviewi see weapon of mass gaming play this and figure i would try it at first grind gauntlet be fun and rewarding but after a few successful run the game just stop i be now in diamond the penultimate rank and it be nigh impossible to get three win in a row the way the difficulty be set up be ambiguous and highly nebulous and it seem like you essentially just get all of your f2p reward a few hour in the game wantsnay need you to play pvp this be because the modern developer think pvp be content it be not pvp be either fluff or the sole purpose of the game the most helpful suggestion on the internet seem to be play draft play draft and play more draft the ai will very frequently curve perfectly and always have a fully functional deck even in forge vs ai mini draft meaning you be always at a distinct disadvantage the algorithm for shuffling be dubious at best many many player have state that they will be either flood or screw for obscene length of time and i can attest to this even with only twelve or so hour at the time of this review it be not too uncommon to draw 12 of your 25 power in a row and sometimes for 2 game in a row the fix deck size and power requirement force this outcome and try to combat it with draw effect seem to make it worse generally speak eternal be f2p do allow you to farm ai but really it be just so rigid and laughably inbalanced that it do not matter for example my first legendary be a 4 4 relic weapon for 4 that make 4 random 1 cost thing when it be destroy that sound awful and random funi will repeat random okay do not equal fun you will see some common and be dumbfound as to why they be not legendarie then you look at the conversion rate for craft and see that it be mostly arbitrary and you be just waste your time once you hit those milestone you be look at hope to get that one free common after 3 win and it will be worth one shardstone how much do it take to craft a common fifty 50 why the difficulty spike suddenly and never abate you initially be afford two loss before the run be over but at a seemingly random point it become one and do since the wooden chest only cough up 25 gold in their death throe and start a forge for your chance at a rare or two be 2 500 gold you will be hammer your left click to get through a lot of menu for quite some time but hey if you want to just jump into rank with a starter deck and ignore the literal concept of fun you may get a little bit ahead of where i be right now oh and daily be just more beg you to play pvp they will just stop let you cheat by play ai you filthy non competitive video gamer,neg
this game look good and the gameplay be good too you can play with your friend in the same squad in game up to 4 player i love tank and plane both but love tank more they be fun to play but the problem be the owner of this game hate germans they be buff and make every other country strong but nerfe germans they do not even have 90 mm weapon when a german tank shoot someone the bullet be just get destroy against the target armor but when anyone else shoot germans they be pierce and get most of the crew out of the game and that be not fair unbalanced especially russian tank for f sake,neg
early access reviewgreat mechanic great game it be pretty rough get legendarie especially since you can have 4 of each but there be many reward system and game mode that let you feel progress it be a little unsatisfying when a player whip 3 of the same powerful legendary on you in a game but if you make your deck well and get some good draw you can sometimes still win in those situation i like it,pos

early access reviewthe good bit of mtg and hearthstone with almost all the bad remove infinitely cheap than mtg with a way more generous f2p model give it an edge over hearthstone as well the 5 colour mana system allow a wide range of deck and more deck tuning option than hearthstone rigid class base system the problem of mana flood screw which plague mtg have be minimize by the way the game force a certain number of power card land in your start hand health return to full at the end of turn like in mtg in addition to the fact that the defend player choose how blocker be assign in combat destroy the curvestone problem of brainless 1 drop 2 drop 3 drop deck be overwhelmingly effective the basic game mechanic encourage and reward slow deck with more interesting decision be develop by a great team include legendary mtg pro player luis scott vargas the bad as it currently stand the game do not explain some of the more intricate interaction very well and kind of assume a certain level of mtg knowledge for example if you try chump block a creature with overwhelm aka trample in mtg and deadly aka deathtouch you may be surprised when your 4 health defender only block one of the damage and the rest hit you you can certainly play this game never have touch mtg but you may run into a few moment like these that may feel unfair the starting campaign be a bit of a slog to get through for new player and do not really do the job of a tutorial in that it do not teach about the kind of interaction mention above however the introduction campaign have just be rework and seem to be much more engaging now if you have ever have even a pass interest in mtg or hearthstone you should try out eternal most of the problem that have turn people i know away from other ccgs have be put to rest in this game,pos

at the time of the review i have about 700 hour log on steam version path of exile be a hardcore action rpg with a lot of depth it will most likely take a while to get in to and it be not suit for quite a lot of gamer however this game be absolutely fantastic pro and con can be subjective so i will just point out main point hardcore can be a heaven for hardcore gamer and a nightmare for casual not recommend for your first arpg free to play but not pay to win gggs microtransaction system be very fair almost everything be cosmetic and nothing in microtransaction store give anyone an advantage realistic gritty graphic i personally love the graphic and art style but it be highly subjective music vary from meh to absolute blast from boring lullaby to beautiful symphony sound design be pretty solid good voice act and realistic sound support be great and quick i personally have great time use it game have class however the class only change how your character look and from where he she start from the skill tree character can use any skill or item if they have require stat skill be skill gem that can be sockete in to item ridiculously flexible and huge skill tree you can make thousand or possibly even million of build with the tree provide skill tree consist of little upgrade for example 0 3 life regeneration or 12 more physical damage some people do not like this but those small upgrade stack fast i personally love the freedom of the skill tree game be base on league so there will be different league where you can create a new character and try new thing lot of equipment variance you can find buy or craft item perfect for your build or even multiple one trading be decent but should be work on you either need to yell to chat or use 3rd party website to make trade game have no auction house or player shop in game leveling can be quick or slow depending on build and skill max level be 100 and you can reach level 70 in 10 15 hour the game have 3 difficulty normal cruel and merciless you will move to the next difficulty after complete storyline story currently be compose of 3 act 4th one be come soon and you complete those act in each difficulty this can be very boring since it can feel like the game be repeat the endgame be a map system you can craft mod in to your map to make them fit your build or your need i personally love this system since it offer a lot of variance vary difficulty and different experience the d sync should be fix in the awakening expansion basically you will be off sync from the game and you may in a different position than your character seem to be on your screen this can and probably will cause a lot of death and frustration but should be get fix soon only thing that have really cause me frustration in the game glad to see it go i may have forget some main point overall i think path of exile be a fantastic game by a fantastic company and i recommend it whole heartedly edit now at over 3k total and the atlas of worlds expansion be fantastic,pos

horrible horrible experience never load loading screen horrible character creation annoying music which you can not mute for a long time early in the game so unfriendly user interface could not add friend no matter how many time we try close and open back again at last we could add each other create a clan and could meet in the game but hey they still do not show up in friend list can not chat on the game nor ask them to help simple task along the game all you can do be see them next to you while talk over skype basically you choose a dragon egg a baby dragon hatch and you need to go fishing to feed it also you create a farm buy seed and wait for crop so you can sell them you can decorate your farm but hey if i want to play farmville i could have play that you know the quest be far beyond silly teach me the scientific method with quiz no sir and if i want to spend ten of dollar i would have buy a decent game rather than several gem when you refuse to pay it crash also if you go nut and type hell in the chat you get ban what the hell,neg

early access reviewafter playing pubg for a year i can definitely recommend this game very smooth br game that have so far the good graphic however it do not compromise performance for the graphic which be obviously a win win you can choose either tpp or fpp like in pubg but it feel like tpp be a smooth experience you also have a choice of three different kit glider snowboard or climber that make the gameplay a tad more funny as you do not rely on vehicle on to travel this game be like a breeze of fresh air no pun intend 9 10,pos

terrible terrible game unfinished cash grab to complete their release on xbox get out while you can honestly it be laggy in city when only 5 people be present for context i have a gtx 970 and i7 4770k so that be all i can vouch for but friend i play with who have well graphic card say it lag for them as well but again that be only ancedotal the content be super lack with the dev have no idea how to balance the skill i be look at you when they patch pvp but it then take 20 min to kill one mob also after that they add in npc into arena which can just one shoot you and totally ruin any aspect of pvp the game be terribly optomize it lack feature that be already out in other region the suposedly new combat system be pretty much the same as in japan with only minor tweak that actually hurt the combat the dev seem to have no idea how their game actually work since the balance patch tend to break more thing than they fix the game be free to play change my review slightly in say that sure go ahead and try even with it be free to play i would not wast my time and thus it still remain a thumb down for me,neg
do not let people turn you away from this game if you really like to race it be a very good simulation but there be some that would say otherwise due to not take the time to get to know the physics model and the fact that the gas pedal have more position than just nothing to floored now that s not to say that this game do not have flaw after all what game these day do not have a flaw here and there the only big flaw for me be that the ai have vastly superiour grip to the player but you can get close with the right amount of tuning and the dev be work on fix that issue right now online race in this game be a real blast in get real mode but first i beg you to log practice time in this mode base on the multiplayer race i have see lately people think that get real mode be go to be like drive a normal car in real life now the problem with that kind of thinking be that the engine on these car be make to go much faster than a normal car that you would drive daily so get real mode take some practice but after you master it it be definately the good mode another thing the dev may add soon be an offline mode which will be great for unexpected time of internet outage since you would still be able to log some track time if you want in short yes this game have some flaw but so do every other game ever develop so if you really like race give this a try i mean its free so you have get nothing to lose except a little bit of time if you do not like the game but would not you have burn that time gaming anyway,pos

  xd here with a brief review of the game elsword and strongly recomend this game to anyone who like adventure socialize talk and trading item also who do not mind spend a few dollar on customise and upgrade the character or character they plan on use later on in the game this game be a side stroll 3d beat em up japanese anime game with real time fight do combo combination while use spell and magic move and skill in your repithior to defeat your enermie you can also use skill point to unlock new skill and new move as you progess through the game and get strong meaning that you and somebody else could have the same character but could fight in totaly different way and set different skill move to manipulate his her character the way they see fit each character have his her storyline of why they be here and their porpose of fighting which you would find out more of if you decide to try this game which i personally think you will not put down when get head and tail of thing i just a few month ago try the game myself and today still play it because there be so many thing in the game that you can do and new thing and great deal and oppertunitie get add to the game on a regular basis plus you can hang out in this game with your friend form party and or group together talk trade socialize in real time go in dungeon together or solo talk and stratigize while fight with your friend in real time or if you got to go or stop play for a while for what ever reason can withdraw from the group party at anytime with the push of a button on your character personal social option plus they start you off with ten resurrection stone and a long bar of life when you first start off and a combo list for your character that you can improve on as you level up and progress though the game at the beginning of the game you can choose the character you want to figh as and that character storyline will begin after you put your personal user name in to identify yourself in the game if it turn out that you do not like that character you could make up to four character or four of the same character in anyway you see fit from the clothe they wear to the way they fight you controll it all or you could chose the character you do not want any more and press delete the game would then ask you be you sure you want to delete the character click yes and the character will be delete no and the character will be spare in my opinion this game be one of the good game i have ever play and be in it for the long hall run they people in this game will get tired of see me and say oh there gos xd again also after customise your character put your move together and learn your skill you can challege your friend and other people online in tournament that give you prise spar session and practice session for fun and to develope your realtime fighting skill that you can level up by appling sp skillpoint that you get when you level up from beat dungeon there be different area to too each with different material you need to craft new weapon amor and clothe you will find out more about this in the game anyways that be some of the basic thing you can do in this game if interested you should give i a try and may end up like the game more than me from xd big fan of elsword,pos

early access reviewbefore i start let me just say that i love this game when i first start play and wish i could go back to it nevertheless my total rating stand at 4 10i have play this game since its early stage and one thing i would like to say be that the dev have no consideration for the people who have put in a lot of hour there use to be different progression system and match where medic be your only source of healing i myself love be a medic but after recent update where after 10 second you regenerate i have be render mostly useless as most player run off and do not stick with a medic i spend so much time grind to buy high tier cube and then come an update where cube have no tier and thus all of my hard work be for nothing i can not even copmpletely paint my ship the color i want to anymore the dev be just become money hungry and ruin the game for old player i do not recommend this game unless you like be disappoint by patch,neg

this game be great in 2014 and after the removal of megabot thing start go downhill from there it have drive away veteran player because of its unplayable state bug keep on get add each update and they have yet to fix the disconnect issue even after 2 year or to cope with it by add a reconnect button in the first place the game be drive towards mech now with each other movement type either forget about ski or good build get nerf the arrival of the energy bar already make classic constant fire gameplay until one side mess up a thing of the past now its a turn base game with i run out of energy now its your turn to shoot me they have add and buff autoaim weapon to cater to their target audience 10 yr old to the game now they also add crate that you can buy at insanely high price for a chance to win legendary item the currency system have be nerfe with all the rich player have next to nothing and the poor player have nothing and continue to get nothing in the drop if they really care about gain revenue and player they would listen to the veteran who have be here the long just because i have log only 700 hrs on steam do not mean i be a noob i play a year on standalone because of how bad the game run on steam which lead me to another point they have different fix for the launcher result in one update which buff and correct the steam launcher first so i come back to steam next thing be with the ongoing change especially to the way damage be deal and how weapon and movement work they break your hard test bot within the next patch build a practical build be now somewhat more annoying although it do offer a challenge to always build the next meta some movement type have completely not receive a buff or a nerf at all and fj be constantly implement new stuff instead of fix up the old stuff or rework it if they could not handle it like the megas they simply remove it from the game and end up remove a great chunk of building and player altogether furthermore each update the game go more downhill move further away from what it once be rip robocraft may 2016,neg
as many gamer know there be a lot of card game out there and this one stand out in that it do not get boring as fast as most of them legend have several play mode and way of gain new card for free however sadly it do have the same mechanic problem that make it p2w due to no real balancing during match player for ranked or unranked game that become more and more obvious for this reason i would only suggest this game to people who love the elder scroll genre and trading card game as well as pay for what they love,pos
early access reviewi have not be real big into the battle royale craze i play pubg a bit but it be always be riddle with bug and i barely touch fortnite and think the building aspect be a neat twist if a bit gimmicky but i see realm royale and have to give it a shot because it look interesting now i know it be painfully obvious hi rez be always try to jump on the bandwagon but this be actually a really solid albeit need a bit more polish game good point matchmaking be really quick southeast asia where i be locate be a bit slow at about a minute wait but the american server take no time at all the class be really cool and all seem viable they be unique in have access to different ability and legendary weapon the map be wonderfully varied with different biome find loot be always worth it even if the stuff be bad than what you have since you can break them down into shard use for craft at a forge also really addicting to loot and find well armor weapon and ability the forge be great the high quality gear you can find in the world be epic with legendary gear need to be craft at these location use shard and even a player elimination for the class specific legendary weapon the crafting process take time and smoke can be see when a forge be be use so these location can be highly contest as other player will want to take the loot for themselves chicken you turn into a chicken when you be knock out and can run and jump if you be not kill within 30 second of be a chicken you will revive yourself this work even in solo and it be fantastic negative point bit of lag at the beginning of match some weapon need tweak nerfed buff the hunter bow have a ridiculous hit box for example the sound effect be bad the sword swing sound be ridiculously stupid and loud the good song in the game play when you be a chicken but i mute music audio entirely because the game music play for like a minute after land in the world and it make it hard to hear other player general polish need character animation look awkward some float tree etc all in all i be impressed with how fun and addicting this game be it change the formula by be class base involve a little more teamwork in that regard be generous with health armor and most of all by the shard and forge crafting system which be just brilliant oh and no building shenanigan,pos
i begin the game and i start to wander around because i have no idea what to do but after 10 minute of the slow walking ever then i find some track i start follow them and after 20 minute i find a mound of deer poop and the keep follow the track then i stumble upon a pheasent the first live creature i have see in the game i aim in my rifle after scour the control on how to equip my gun and pull the trigger nothing come out a notification that i do not have the correct license to hunt that type of animal and that if i want to become a member to check the store so i walk around for another 20 minute i end up make a circle of the whole map and end up at the lodge where i begin then i quit the game that explain the time i have in it after look at the store i come to notice that this game be pay to win and then i uninstalle it i would not recomend this game unless it be bill gate because he could afford to buy all of the crap that in any other game you would purchase with ingame money,neg
a very good hack n slash game or diablo like if you want to name it that way that s f2p but not pay to win in any way it become a little grindy in endgame but besides that poe be a fun game that offer a lot of content for literally nothing it may become boring if you be not into create new character to try out build or find explore some area over and over again bore worth at least a playthrough9 10 in my book,pos
early access reviewgreat concept bad community management pathetic communication by the dev team and a laundry list of old bug that should have be correct year ago plague an otherwise cool concept with each update experience grinding get bad and worse extend the gap between rank all in all i can not recommend this title it be get steadily bad instead of well and the dev team seem to be asleep at the wheel,neg
one of the good idle game i have ever play what set this title apart for other in the genre be the currency bonus be not apply all at once or in a linear fashion instead only some bonus from a large pool can be actively combine to suit different play style i e offline online fast or slow session many bonus be secret until unlock this offset the normally repetitive and sometimes bore nature of other idler i have be play for 3 over month and i be still unlock content,pos

dota 2 be a first person mmo rpg survival horror game develop by ea and ea only where you have to fight to survive in the drunken robot zombie apocalypse with nothing but your bare foot as your hand be too pre occupy take off your pantie in excitement for this sick filth the main protagonist be you jakob you be a lone survivor and every other player in the entire damn universe be an enemy jakobs model really match his personality a hipster emo gothic sex drive male pair with the voice act of morgan freeman really make this character pop out and help make him really relatable the storyline be great i love how the developer have a completely separate prologue chapter for the story explain how such an apocalypse could have ever rise from the deep depth of hell that be not a spoiler as you see that in the first 15 minute of the game you start out in the middle of er russia spending time with your beloved family and find out you be really really attracted to your cousin you take her out to show her the world when suddenly a crack open from the ground beneath you your cousin fall into the crevice you be devastate you try to rush home but then all of a sudden you hear a big er plop you look behind you and there be robot zombie all drink vodka you then turn all around and find yourself surrounded and i will stop there otherwise i may end up spoil the prologue the pvp in this game be spot on it be like the developer know that you be the main character and give you the most overpowered arsenal right from the get go it be brilliant need i say more fine i shall just like the amazingness that be dungeon keeper mobile you too can attain the most powerful arsenal by slam your wallet into eas pocket it be fantastic the good part too it be free um what i mean to say be it do not even cost a dime overall i would say this game be a 10 10 a must have game ea have really show how to create such a game i be just wait on the dlc to come out later since surprisingly there be no day one dlc,pos
i use like this game at first but 4 year on game be become unenjoyable full of bug when paladin first come out as new class when i be level up my paladin i say to myself wow he be be strong at low level but they nerte paladin bad now as well few other class have be nerte now they remove little scroll icon on arc launch it be use to get zen without spend real money i know there be ad exchange in game to get zen with ad but it too confusing for me i do not like profession the way upgrade thing to upgrade stuff be cost too much,neg
the first thing probably on anyones mind when see the screenshot of this game be a ripoff of minecraft it can be consider that but with almost too many year of experience with minecraft creativerse have a lot of difference it honestly feel a little like a different game the graphic be amazing and the creature roam around be terrifying and adorable all at the same time the gameplay be nothing like i have see before with item such as the extractor and a creative way of obtain item without the use of a shovel axe or pickaxe it can take some time to figure out what to do and go through god know how many task a huge setback for some peep can be the fact that in order to experience even more the game you have to pay around 19 buck or so to upgrade to creativerse pro,pos
a long time ago i would recomend this game but they change it to the point that i no longer enjoy play do not get me wrong the actual game be really fun but the dev ruin it its pay to win practically pay to play the crate system be cool at first then they add the premium almost everytime you get something half decent its in the premium only section everything in the store be super expensive and sell for practically nothing its kind of disgusting how they change all their system so that its more profitable i love this game and i want to play it but everytime i do it show me just why i stop its about that time that i reinstall it check out the new stuff hate the game again and stop play for another 1 2 3 4 of a year i do not know why i keep come back i know they be not go to fix what they have do but i just keep hope and keep be disapointed there s a reason that most people who play from the beggining do not play anymore and those that do only play because they already have all the stuff they need not like they can get it from a crate or the shop,neg
i have play this gem of a game a total of 287 hour before it be available on steam and i could start play it on my steam account i start play smite in open beta i even have a close beta key but stupid me do not start play smite back then because the premise of a moba sound boring i have no idea well smite could be call the non boring moba this be a full action game you play in 3rd person so you can enjoy the beautiful level and the even more beautiful ability effect from a decent angle of view even better be you can enjoy the look of the god and their many awesome skin from up close the gameplay do not lack either once you know how to upgrade ability and when to purchase which item casual play which i prefer but smite have a huge competitive scene with league etc if you prefer that be a lot of fun and will entertain you for many hour especially because you can choose from many different god to play as well as a good selection of different game mode god yes you play god this game do not feature unknown fantasy character with a lame backstory instead you play one of currently january 2016 73 god and some mythical demon and monster like thor freya athena ares isis osiris hercules mercury kali rama kukulkan chaac sun wukong change and recently january 2016 introduce amaterasu as first goddess of the japanese pantheon it be likely that more pantheon will be add in the future the fact that you be an actual god in a battle for the heavens make this game feel more epic than other mobas which be support by the scenery item and music in the game this be a free to play game which have an acceptable in game economy there be no pay to win at all in this game everything you buy for real money be cosmetic from avatar skin voice pack to music or announcer pack all god can be unlock by play other god you get a selection of god for free when start the game and many skin and other item can be unlock by play as well the only thing you could say against smite be that a game can swing to one side a little too quickly however even in the smite world championship we have see interesting turn in a game so the imbalance be perfectly acceptable i can recommend this game even to people who think mobas be bore you will probably be disabuse of this notion like me,pos
this game be pretty trash tbh i think the game like me by give me good role and but after i stop play for a while and get back on the game start give me bad roll and give merng if you want to be good at this game you need to have good rng and i do not know what i be talk about anymore so i give this game 0 10 because my dad beat me everynight,neg

disclaimer the game itself be not inherently bad i do put over 15 hour into it before uninstalle it you have get the mechanic of bloon td 5 couple with a competitive multiplayer aspect however there be many flaw within the game mechanic that simply make it such that i would not tell my friend about it first the game be straight up pay2win bloon td5 be good this be a cash grab the game would be better balanced if they just charge five buck for it and put everyone on equal footing but that be not the case you buy tower unlock which give you an advantage over your opponent you buy energy which give you an advantage over your opponent you buy club access unobtainable by non paying which give you access to more arena with special rule second there be some balance issue do you spend 10 on the newbie starter pack if you do you have enough medallion to buy the cobra tower this tower make it impossible to lose versus player that do not have this tower in defense mode you gain extra life every fifteen second which be sizable in assault mode your opponent lose 2 of their 150 life every fifteen second per cobra tower you have that be to say you will win versus your opponent without have to watch a single bloon go by them buy these tower and upgrade them then wait em out in both assault and defense mode both of the f2p mode this tower also increase your cash income by give you extra money every round if you have it where be the fun in stomp people that do not have it if you do not have it where be the fun in lose a game where the rule do not matter third the meta be very stale at the high rank everyone use the same tower loadout just google bloons td battles chipper farm do you not spend 10 on this because the game be supposedly free many of your match will be fair but if you see a cobra tower on the other side just surrender because you be lose this round not to the rule of the game but rather to teh ultimate tower 11 one your energy replenish at a rate of 5 per hour to a max of 20 be that too slow buy more energy with real monie be the energy cap too low buy an increase energy have a tangible effect on the game most notably by increase the attack speed of all your tower for a short time a la the mib call to arm effect in bloon td 5 be you out of energy and refuse to spend cash on the game your opponent may simply have an advantage over you as they can use this ability and you can not instead of use tower to unlock high tier you use medallion to unlock high tier as your level increase do not feel like use medallion and or wait for your level to get high enough guess what five buck get around all that noise card mode be akin to hearthstone in that whoever have the most sink into it win the detail and mechanic be too esoteric to go into here but it be even bad than the assault defense mode balance to top it all off the game be full of cheater just google bloons td battle hack and click on any of the myriad result to get an example of this tl dr the game would be well if the follow occur strict and immediate punishment for cheater cobra tower remove or rebalance pay money to get these an equal amount of energy give to both player at the start of a match pay money to have more tower level limit equal on both player in a match pay money to max tower,neg

i have be play this game for over a year and i have to say that before i know about dota 2 i never would have think that a game would bring me the great pain i have ever feel really everything about this game be toxic and suck the community be horrible as and so be the matchmaking people pick support hero actually be not able to do their job and instead of buy ward and support the team what they be actually mean to do they go for their ing item first and do not even think about upgrade the courier after minute 3 yeah and it be unnecessary to mention that they sometimes do not buy this courier at all so i be ask myself who in the hellinto their head for them to do such stupid thing it all about teamplay in this game and the game can only be win when every player do his job instead of jerk around and when there be already 4 carry why the do you the last one for pick go for a carry hero too that make no sense while play dota 2 i discover that this game bring out a really dark side of me normally i be a calm and relaxed person but dota 2 force me to go to the limit and for the first time in my young life i realize that i can be toxic and salty like the rest of the too when the game do not go well because my team mate be s again that be why i prefer to play with friend instead of go alone if it be your lucky day you will have a nice team which know how to play and if not then let me say this rip there be no more to say really you will get this cancer gang and the game will be ed up furthermore you will waste more or less 40 minute of your precious time but trust me it will take long way longer trust me and because you be a masochist like me you will not quit this game although you often say to yourself that this will be the last game you have ever play before delete dota 2 no instead of quit the game you will play more and more match you will get mad as hell learn russian and persian for free and this will be a vicious circle you can not get out of it you be trap in this game it be really sad i have try so hard but always end up play when i have some time so here be my advice 1 never play alone when you have just start this game and do not have enough experience yet 2 always have some food and drink preferably alcoholic next to you because play and flaming will burn your energy which you actually need for a win or maybe for more flaming 3 schedule your free time it be not only 40 minute you will spend on this game actually it will be more than this sometimes the whole day be ruin by dota 2 once you start play you can not stop anymore 4 you have to be thick skinned or have nerve of steel there be no other way to endure this community you get it great then i wish you guy lot of joy play dota 2 3,pos
it be a monopoly like game though monopoly mechanic be throw out the window and the whole game just come down to click ok after roll a dice and decide whether or not to buy a piece of the board it lack some crucial feature to make you feel like you have a meaningful influence on the outcome of the game you can not bid when buy put a mortgage on your city you can only sell entire city can not even sell single house or trade city with other player so that you both agree on a price you can just buy them back from other without even ask them it be pay to win in a way that you can choose to roll favourable dice you can get random disconnect for no reason and then you can not reconnect definitely not recommend,neg

it can be fun for short period with the little money you will get daily enough for a few of the cheap payout game you can play you may win those game too however to rank in a tournament you need to play high cost payout battle this mean you will spend hour and hour save money if you want to try and get into one of those decent payout tournament that be not all though you will spend what little money you have on upgrade tower mean you be back to play the cheap payout game there be so to play in any tournament you need to spend money once you be there expect to lose everytime you can copy exactly what the opponenet do layout boost balloon send etc and still lose very easily very big pay to win game so if you be ok with that or with play a few cheap game per day max then this be ok,neg

this game be fun i do not play it for a long time due to all of the negative review i pop on one saturday when i be bored and get instantly hook i love wwii era aircraft and this game have alot to offer in that area you earn research and in game currency by complete mission against other player on fairly large game map as you progress you unlock well plane and hard map each aircraft have modification and such that you can unlock use research and in game currency as well i have not have any problem with any of the admin yet although i admit that i do not speak in game much unlock plane can be tedious in the high tier but i be still have fun if there be nothing to unlock i would probably not play the game as much as i do each plane must be fly for a while to figure out what it be capable of if you be impatient i can see how you would lose it with some of the plane that be hard to master they can seem useless until you use them the way they be intend to be use and in the right level of play get people to actually pay attention to the objective can be difficult at time and can lead to frustration however when you get in a match with even just a couple of team player on your side it can be a wonderful heroic type experience the scoring in the game definitely do not reflect the effort put into actually pull off a win for instance i can do a bombing run that be successfull and destroy all of the enemy basis as well as several ground target and end up next to last place when the ranked scoring come up at the end of a match the guy who get the most point be the guy who have the most air kill most of the time this often lead to people ignore the objective and rack up a huge score buzz around in the middle of the map dogfighting meanwhile the people actually defendie asset and destroy the enemy objective be leave to do the work and get a much less score i admit sometimes when i need just a bit more research i will ignore the objective and use my good plane to get a huge sick score down plane in the middle with the rest of the monkey so i really can not complain too much the folk do that be probably just do the same thing if you be go to invest in gold eagle real money currency then i recommend that you buy the pack and such when they be on sale i also highly suggest that you use them to buy more crew i run seven crew for each country that be about the max you will ever need the tank be fun too but i play almost exclusively airplane when i get more involved in the tank i will update this review the little bit i have play tank be really fun lastly if you be not comfortable with death around every corner and player that be well than you than i would not bother to install this game there be alot of people that be really good at this game and you will die alot i buy a pack that i already own just for the golden eagles since it be cheap when i redeem it it give me nothing i open a ticket and after an hour or so i get a response the csr be very nice and understand english i ask if i could have the code back so i could give to a friend he say sure and send me the code back as unredeemed i give to my buddy and all be well only reason i be post this be that i see some folk complain about how the customer service stink i do not have a problem with my ticket a long time have pass and i still love this game i still exclusively fly airplane,pos

one of the most toxic player basis in the moba genre and that be with game like lol and dota with people tell other to kill themselves every game however those game have the advantage of be good kudo to smite for have varied game mode and the third person perspective really change up the formular the game be serviceable if you be willing to ignore the game glaire fault its community today for example i play 7 game throughout the day 2 of which i be tell to kill myself 1 have someone allude to my sexuality be less than favourableand 2 other game devolve into petty name call and sh tposte rather than play the game the vast majority of player will throw game if you do not let them win their way in a world where other well studio be take big step to fix their community hi rez seem far more occupy with make questionably infringent copy of other game whilst not take the time to help the community grow healthly before you ask yes these people be report no nothing happen good time be have with this game but play this with other people make me concerned for my own sanity thus make it impossible to recommend this game to anyone i have to warn a friend who be start to be careful of people probably tell her to kill herself if she do not play the right way she stop play soon after when i be prove right within mere moment of the warning gameplay 6 10game itself 2 10,neg
early access reviewfinally uninstalle after the last patch it have so much potential to be a good game dev think the community be idiot and will not listen to a word they say i be do rip,neg
early access reviewi could easily write a 10 page essay on all the issue bless currently have item duplication exploit that have be present and know ever since korean release terrible optimization as soon as there be more than 5 player on screen the fps go down to 30 even or powerful top end system game have a large emphasise on pvp have such low fps be unacceptable buggy quest bad translation and voice act miss contentthese be the most game breaking issue there be many more issue but i be so feed up with the game that i can not even be bother rant about them,neg

the first hour i make little kid crynow at level 50 their deck make me cryjust like real life10 10 you can not go wrongedit i have over 100 hour on the android version and i have only pay once i find the rng box really help the f2p element for f2per so if you be tell its p2w then that person have not make a very good deck,pos
even though this game be simple and decent fun it be pretty dull and repetitive once you play it for a while there be micro transaction of some level which be pretty much inevitable in today free to play title at least it be free and you can play it a fairly decent amount without invest any money in it,pos
its amazing how every single patch they release the game just get more e break not to mention 90 of the playerbase be toxic and dumb there will never be a time when this game be good stay the hell away from this trash oh and do i mention why tf do they give thoth a stun on his escape an escape that take you from earth to neptune,neg
product receive for freeearly access reviewhuh where i even start the game it self it be just another 2d party fighting game base on multiple gamemode once you start the game for the first time you probably be go to play free for all since it be the most gamemode play when you start play it you have 33 character to use and more come up but there be only 6 character to use for free per week you can also unlock character with the currency of the game each one with 2 type of weapon include the unarmed fist the game it self it can be see as a competitive game or a fun party game depend on the case your working once i get 100 hour on the game i start play the gamemode rank where i start learn a lot of the game and also some cool trick to use like the gravity cancel once i know some combo with my main character asuri i start take the game as something more serious since i never have a game that keep me play it for that time i start play the game since it be around 4 week old so i grow up with the game i never want to search for combo video since i want to learn how to play it by myself so after 500 hour i have atleast 24 character unlock i be rank gold with only one skin buy since it be thoose day where i start use other character instead of my main character now that i pass the 700 hour i can already tell that i spend a lot of time of this game around 4 hour per day this game make me find new people who be now my friend but as always nothing it be perfect this the moment when i stop talk about the pro and start move to the issue i have with game the game itself it can be see as a competitive game but that do not mean your not go to find people who probably be there just try to be a jerk with everyone they find on the game the game it iself have some player that take the game to seriously so they probably will try to win no matter what instead of have fun as the game it be suppose to be so do not feel angry if you fight someone and after the match he leave without say gg or let some insult in the chat and also when they win they will probably will say ez instead of gg to make the thing more easy to explain you will find a lot of salt on this game at the topic of microtransaction this game like almost every f2p game have microtransaction but that do not mean this be a pay to win game since that the only thing you can buy it be character skin k o effect sidekick and avatar so the microtransaction do not affect the gameplay itself if i be a videogame reviewer i will probably say that this game itself it can be funny to play but only with friend but since i have 900 hour on the game the only thing i can say it be and it be pretty amazingit be a pretty fun game rayzoomfox,pos
edit for a disclaimer this game be available for several month before steam release so my playtime here on steam do not nearly reflect the hundred of hour i have play this game since close beta be you look for the good card game out there look no further i have play three different card game and this be the one i stick to i have be play it since close beta back in summer last year and i still enjoy the game which say a lot this be quite an extensive review it be structure as follow first a comparison to other card games hs and gwent then a general pro and contra list and lastly my rating tl dr it be a great game you should give it a try if you like card game or any elder scroll game what set this game apart from other card game let us compare it to the most famous one first hearthstone tesl have a lot less rng so skill and strategic thinking get reward more tesl be way more generous in term of acquire card the story mode be very rewarding and you get rare epic and legendary card while level up your character to level 50 also arena reward be well and run stop at 7 win 7 win can give you up to 4 card pack you can definitely play this game without spend money on it you just have to invest some time of course game mechanic there be the rune system which draw you a card for every 5 health you lose if it be a prophecy card you can play it for free during your opponent turn this keep aggro deck in check and add interaction aside from that there be two board lane in this game which add a lot more complexity to the gameplay since you can not shut down your opponent by play one big guard no hero power while many class in hs be define by their hero power tesl be a lot more flexible in that regard there be 10 class each a combination from 2 of the 5 color attribute but you can play mono color as well if you want to and each class have multiple viable archetype just as an example control mage be a very classic control deck in the color blue and yellow but you can also create a very aggressive action deck in those color and a less aggressive midrange version archer red green have aggro midrange combo and control deck there be a lot of variety the developer be very reactive in term of card balance if a card become too opressive and a single deck dominate the entire meta they usually react to it very fast when do so they have show to have a good hand for it unlike in hs many of the nerfed card remain viable after their nerf card usually do not get nerfe to death laddering be much more pleasing you can not lose rank in tesl which make the whole experience a lot less frustrating also you have to win less match to make it to legend rank since there be only 12 rank and lastly the monthly rank reset be very friendly you get reset to rank 5 if you finish at least rank 4 or high or 9 if you finish at least rank 8 or high recently gwent be release which i play for a few week during close beta so let me adress this as well gwent be a very original game because of its 2 round win system and the abundance of a mana system which truly set it apart from other card game this may be refresh for some player but for me personally it be too far away from traditional card game it feel more like a board game to me because i want interaction between minion in a card game so while tesl be a much more complex and well game in the style of hearthstone gwent be pretty much its own game in addition to that tesl have one very huge advantage over gwent there be already mobile version for the game smartphone version be not release yet but they be expect to be release early summer so that should not take much longer currently the android tablet app also work on phone it be just not optimize for it and menu and stuff be a little tiny on a smartphone screen some general thought on what be good and bad aside from the alreday mention thing good the meta this have to do with the point about the dev be reactive but even without them intervene the meta be usually very diverse in tesl first of all you can win with every archetype but aside from that the meta never really get dominate by one single deck because there be counter to every deck as a result the meta can be very shifty if too many people play a certain deck more people will start to run deck that counter that deck if that counter deck get too popular there be usually another deck that counter it i personally never experience such a lively meta in a cardgame before solo content tesl offer a solo arena mode in which you can draft a deck and play against the ai and you still get some nice reward for it so you do not even have to face human opponent if you do not feel like it additionally the story mode in tesl be the good one i have ever see in a cardgame the campaign be a nice start but the recently add expansion dark brotherhood really take it to the next level unlike those bore hs adventure that you just have to complete to get new card there be actually an interesting story to play through and the level along the way be also create in a very creative way tes lore do you like tes game you will probably recognize a few character in here i think the majority of card be inspire by the elder scroll online but it be definitely not limited to that oh and the menu soundtrack be as good as you would expect it from a tes game monthly card to keep the game fresh the dev add a new monthly card every season some of them be very impactful and shake up the meta other be not anyway it be very nice to see new content that regularly gauntlet mode this new game mode be already announce and should be release very soon the general idea be that there will be certain rule for deck construction you can then enter gauntlet mode with your deck build accord to those rule and face other player your run end after 3 loss so it be somewhat comparable to arena entrence fee should be the same as well bad now this be purely a matter of taste but some people dislike the look of the game i personally like it and it think it fit the general theme of tes game very well also it look much more mature and serious than hs for example still they could add some new gameboard and more song to the soundtrack since you can get tired of those after almost a year of play this game reward for rank mode you receive 1 2 or 3 copy of the monthly card depend on your rank each season rank 9 5 or 1 which be cool but other than that the reward be a little lackluster just a bit of gold and some dust for craft card marketing bethesda have not yet push this game a lot so the playerbase be still fairly limited do not get me wrong there be more than enough player in this game to always find an opponent in less than a minute but many potential player simply do not know about this game yet but it be safe to assume that bethesda will market this game much more as soon as all the mobile version be release so it be probably just a matter of time my final rating a solid 9 10 the game be not perfect but there be not much to improve the ranked reward bother me a little and they could add some stuff to make the game look more interesting and diverse but aside from that it honestly be the good card game i have ever play and it be free to play so go ahead and try it yourself if you have not already enjoy,pos
early access reviewi play this game infrequently and i enjoy it very much whenever i do play it this be one of the best free to play game i have ever play and if you have not play it yet you need to,pos
early access reviewonly thing i do not have a problem be the content overall they do do a good job over the year with a majority of the content but let us be very honest here we get player on this game who be pretty stupid and by that let say like majority have an iq of 5 they do not have anything well to do than just sit around and bash n troll each over over stupid game currency or w e they also lie about a lot of what they do in real life just to make themselves imitate and this apply on aqw as well community be legit cancer so that be one very major downside next some developer make way too many rework devalue the original rare the real veteran spend time to obtain all those year maybe be more creative instead of copy stuff yeah and maybe also not see certain player as special because i can not recall how many ae player on twitter beg the developer for random special rare because they think they be special they need to do this for all ex and current moderator and tester because they end up get an unfair advantage by load rare that will not be remove from their account so the rework and loader be another very major setback now i be speak for everyone on this one big one none of the staff member be able to ever address bot way too many of them yes they be originally on aqw but now i have see a few of them on aq3d now i personally speak with the lead moderator for aq3d regard this once nothing have be do about that and same story for aqw nothing be do after send a email in concern there be far more bot on aqw than aq3d but without anyone deal with the botter on both game give the cheater a big and of course an unfair advantage now these be 3 major reason why i do not recommend this game nor would i recommend the other version this be also why it have go downhill ever since 2012 if the ae staff be to assess and do something about these key point there be a chance i would see hope for ae again it be also why i do not come on both game that often these day lucario original aq player since june 2005 aqw player since beta testing in june 2008 aq3d player since alpha testing in august 2015,neg
this be a head up for return player that be have problem with the 2 stage google authentication system this developer have set up what a nightmare i have have try to get my account verify so i can bypass this system that be not work for me if you be an aged user of the game pre 2014 you will find it very interesting interact with their support centre and the hoop they ask you to jump through it be a great game but unfortunately their support be very ordinary and not user friendly at all,neg
forewordthis document be not a review as much as it be my individual perception and impression of the game the singular goal of this writing be to allow an individual who be unfamiliar with path of exile to rapidly establish an understanding of what this game really be to begin any discussion of this game ask yourself what do i value more a good experience or a good reward be i more experience orient with my gaming or more reward orient if you find yourself to be a reward orient gamer you can stop read now this be an experience orient game for most player in fact path of exile be more likely to kill your character than to reward you this be intend to be a light review so i will compress this message into the follow category game design and experience element gameplay and mechanical element rpg and technical element i have decide against include anything about the path of exile community as it be not directly relate to the game itself game design and experience elementspath of exile be free to play grind to grind action rpg that offer the one of great gaming sandbox for build your own unique gameplay experience it be intend that a player create build and tailor a character to then play the game in real time i offer a break down of these label below storywe can start with the game context the story of the game be as thin as the lore be impenetrable i can explain the story a demonic political figure have exile you to a nightmare so you set off to murder him during your murderous expedition you put down legion of monster zombie and mutant as you get wrap up in the mystery of the nightmare so that be all good the lore be much much hard to explain and piece together path be one of those game that have a simple story and a voluminous lore one can draw comparison to dark soul the challenge of piece the lore together be there for anyone who want it the grindnow let us shift the discussion towards the grind it be time for some raw perception about how this game implement the dungeon crawler there be a few thing inherent to all arpgs cool skill skill system zone instance mad loot tier of enemy powerful boss mob and farming player will be farm in the later level of this game so that they can survive move up to high level the game deserve the grind to grind label but it be not all bad this game provide excellent enemy variety with its affix system and the developer continually introduce more new enemy to the game the affix monster that the game generate provide a challenge to all build as they expose different weakness in your character make no mistake you will be play to kill monster in this game period but it will be engage as each new monster situation will teach you something new about your build buildsi just mention it above and we must speak about it now this idea of a build all character have a build to them the build be a character combination of item link active skill and passive skill the game revolve around make your build efficient fun fast survivable as oppose to slow boring costly and weak this be where the experience orientation i mention above come into play player be in charge of create build play and tailor their character as a project i will offer a simple example of how an item a skill and its passive interact together the experience of pull off a sick build be the only reward that this game will give you f2plastly for this section the game be f2p go download and play it with no financial investment your character will look terrible as you cobble together different item the business model depend on it gameplay and mechanicsmechanicsthis game be clunky there be no hiding that fact path use the angled top down view with the camera glue to your character the player click on the screen to move like many other arpgs diablo series dota series league of legends but it be not as smooth and some people consider it jar the mechanic be decent at best but never below serviceable i find it to be a trivial acclimation but some mechanic nut may hate it some skill be inherently clunki than other but be easy to just not invest in over time character pick up movement skill and movement speed on gear which clear up most of the issue experience early game actionsa build consist of usually one or two primary skill damage dealer summon and one or two secondary skill buff debuff skill movement skill it be totally customizable to whatever you do but the above be what be typical to good solid build you will not have your hand scramble around the keyboard to make the game work player hand will default configuration rest on the top left of the keyboard near wasd and the 1 5 number row segment mechanical challengethe enemy in the game do not demand high mechanical skill to outplay this somewhat change with map speed mod and end game boss but be fairly uncommon in the base game the focus of the game be squarely on its rpg mechanic to win you fight rather than kite and the various form of tank the focus of the game be not about its mechanic but some may find it clunky rpg technical elementswe have arrive at the real focus of the game this section could be many time large than the previous section i need to stress something here that many player do not perceive about path of exile defense this game will absolutely ing murder you and completely neutralize an entire character build if there be imbalance between offensive and defensive investment in active skill passive and gear all player have the game difficulty scale the same way as they progress and at a certain point a build with no defense be render unplayable the issue of un playability be one that be uniquely stressed in this game player can really up the rpg element balance for themselves by not get enough life in their passive tree passive skill treelet us talk about the passive tree i want everyone to know that the passive tree do not matter until a player have an idea let me repeat that it just do not matter for a new player a brand new player fire up path of exile for the first time and set off to beat the game the game happily oblige to this course of action and eventually murder or nearly murder the new player the new player must be unsatisfied with this result for the passive tree to begin to matter the player must have the gear start to turn in their head to begin to have an idea for improvement the idea for improvement become systemic the more the game be play the systemic idea for improvement become a starting point for a build and it be at this point that the passive tree begin to matter the passive tree be not up for interpretation or understanding until a player have an idea for improvement once a player have this idea understand the passive tree be trivial summaryfrom a review standpoint the interplay between the difficulty of the game and passive skill tree understanding be enough to hard carry the entire ensemble of game design mechanic and rpg element to excellence veteran player already have the understanding of all of this the game itself be a hard hitting benchmark for how well they can execute their build path of exile be free to play grind to grind action rpg that offer the one of great gaming sandbox for build your own unique gameplay experience,pos
i be really enjoy the game until i realize a few thing apparently in war thunder a tank can take 5 shell to the engine and still operate a tank gun can take 3 shell and still operate and a tank crew can take an unlimited amount of shell until every last member have be knock out i pelt so many tank with shell that there be no way they should have be able to move even without kill the crew i put 15 shell into 1 tank i do not aim at the same spot twice i would move the cross hair across the tank try to hit every spot and it do not die i think this game go for realism,neg

early access reviewi enjoy the game and its be slowly get well performance wise and it feel like it have a lot of potential i put these issue down in hope that the dev team will fix them no official forum just link to steam community hub need a feedback forum so they be aware of problem wolf noise howl out marta be so excessive its annoying i havnt see a repair warning at all plus you can not do it below level 13 do not understand some of the quest arnt very explicit skill window do not really explain initially how to equip skill and terminology like the use of mount rather then equip be weird enhance and upgrade companion be not really explicitly explain how to get guild level guild exp and how many member you can have per level be not explain emote arnt visible stone the gatherable be very rare lol the publisher do not seem very involved when people level people do not know to do hunting quest the interface i feel like be cause a bit of lag i do some suggest ini fix that make the game lagg so much less though i still have spontanious fps drop do not understand why you can not use flight path in area your story have not reach yet unsure what the requirment be for pet to give buff no stamina bar for when you sprint there be just some little problem leave open door to lack of information some weird balance some unconventionality etc it can be a little problematic but i do feel like this game have great potential if they make good choice in development,pos

war thunder be by far the leader in flight simulator out there despite be free to play war thunder have perfect graphical detail with painstakingly model aircraft and now tank to create the ultimate world war two aerial and ground battle experience the user interface be intuitive allow for the use of just mouse and key to control an aircraft or tank however the option of a joystick be there for more experienced player as well as the focus on multiplayer battle gaiijin have also credit the game with a series of single player mission that help earn credit in game whilst the war thunder economy have see rapid change over the last 5 6 patch it have finally be level out to create a gradual but still progressive and entertaining progression system that allow for a long but rewarding levelling system one area that lack the polish that be see in other area of the game be the cooperative multiplayer as this aspect of the game see a confusing friending and squad system that not only be clunky to use but also reduce frame rate substantially and this be a game killer for player that use less powerful pc or laptop conclusively war thunder present itself as a highly successful game with superb graphic gameplay reward and a grow player base as well as the addition of constantly update feature do to its open beta status i highly recommend this game 9 10,pos
team fortress 2 be a fun game and for well or for bad its one that s best experience by put a lot of time into it there be hundred of weapon that have different strength weakness and special effect which mean that a dedicated player will find a lot of enjoyment in playing for a long time and try to collect the good one for their choose class the colorful and humorous style of the game make it a joy to watch and hear as you play and the class base system make teamwork very important all in all it be a very well make and enjoyable multiplayer shooter and its completely free make it a great choice for someone who want to enjoy a video game with their friend that say its not the ideal game for someone who just want to spend a few minute every now and again its expansive item and class system reward time and if there s not much time spend on it its still fun but not as rewarding that say that person should not be too young the violence be not too much of a concern its more graphic than most cartoon slaptstick but not really any more offensive due to its cartoony nature its just silly rather then be graphic or disturbing but play with real people over the internet simply require enough maturity to understand and deal with the fact that people can sometimes be annoying or terrible and though its not a dreadful community of people its not without its bad apple if your child be mature enough to handle the stuff classmate and internet community tend to throw at them there should not be a problem with this game and if not there s always the option to turn off the blood and social element of the game in my opinion team fortress 2 in my opinion be the good game valve ever make the game get update every now and then and with each update many thing be change be good and sometimes bad weapon be update with new statistic and lovable cosmetic be add i really enjoy the diversity and variety of cosmetic each playable character have in the game all i think valve need to do be to just listen to the tf community more often and value their opinion in conclusion i think that this be the good game i have ever play make from valve and i highly recommend this game in future to other player as this be something everyone need to try out once in their life,pos
early access reviewthis game show many thing i love great graphic great performance and high social aspect i run this game on a beat down laptop and it still run perfectly never ever have a frame skip i team up with player around me to beat a boss and then say thank and go on with my adventure i be not sure how much the cross platforming be add to the player base but i have never be in an area with no one in it but sadly the con craft be expensive and take a long time the material need be sometimes terrifying to think about timewise and do not get me start on quest i start a kill 20 quest and then after that pick up another quest that say collect 20 and it be basically kill the same monster the grind be very real in this game and it be what bring it down to not enjoyable i have not see a party system for the general area yet so i can not team with anyone and have their kill count towards mine unless i hit someones monster in the end this game manage to keep player base by long tedious quest that be poorly think out the dialogue be very enjoyable though 4 10 if this be the full game 6 10 because it be early access and can still change i hope maybe wait a little for this one or play an hour to see what i mean edit after this review i have continue to drop on so it be addict just a pain in the neck,neg

early access reviewi have be play for 2 or 3 month now and this game while not perfect be a lot of fun and truley free to play i have not spend a dime yet but as another mention they almost feel bad about how generous the free to play be so i may end up throw a few buck out to support the game i have complete all the campaign currently available and have stock pile of gold to use on the new shadow campaign once it come out i may play for 2 hour or so at a time a couple time a week i ago afk for extended period of time so my playtime be not as much as it appear as far as pvp go i do not put a ton of time into build a deck or do any research and have get to gold 1 last month not say that be any kind of achievement but for a casual player with a let just have some fun while i listen to podcast i feel satisfied with it i like the flexibility with the power system,pos

early access reviewvery solid classic mmo great world translation need a little more work and some optimzation could be make overall if you enjoy mmos this be worth a try cash shop seem to me akin to gw2 its very humble price seem fair and its only cosemetic and conveince item since you buy to play everthing be open to you the subscription will allow you to level 20 faster but you will not get any advantage useful for those who can only play casually i would wait and watch the development of the game currently there be nothing to do at the end game for some reason the developer spend time remove feature that be available in the japanese version of the game and the current na localization be very incomplete if you be expect a full game then do not buy the game have fun part but overall neowiz have a lot more work to do,neg

early access reviewthis game be simply childish there be not much to do this game have potential but it be waste if you like the mechanic though everquest have the same mechanic,neg
this game have some real good potential the concept be good since most of ww2 games cost money but h g dosentthe only problem be that developer do not see what they have and they prefeer the money developer dosent even care it would be a good game if they care sorry for grammor,neg
one of my favorite game in my library my play time reflect how much time i have spend appreciate the team work and competitive spirit of the game support who actually support the team carry who can carry the team to victory and player who can execute a base push as timely as the new york sunway by the way i love subway sandwich i eat a blt without the t almost every week bacon be the most delicious meat lettuce be like the cup to the tea party you can not have tea without water and you can not hold water without cup unless of course you use your hand or your mouth but lettuce cup be pretty delicious so imagine the bacon and the lettuce together but without the disgusting creature know as tomato which while they rhyme with potato do not taste anything similar if potato taste like french fry tomato would taste like awful fry wet vegetable speak of wet table if you put water on table it get wet not stuff like multiplication table that be way too complicated what be 6x6 its like 64 or something which be like 10 if you add them all together what do that mean i be not sure math be hard unlike dota2 which be a great game especially as a carry actually i never play carry before it seem like a pretty easy job though just kill thing until you win the game that be a pretty simple job description unlike support or mid or offlane or jungle i mean jungle be a location how be it a job it be more like a forest than a jungle i mean jungle have lion and stuff right forest have angry bear i be not sure where man bird and horse man be from though horse be not jungle creature i think they sound more like mountain creature to be honest i have not see a troll before or a gnoll but i bet they be forest creature as well too so jungle should really be call forest mid be a pretty self explanatory position its the middle of the map lane like if you have 3 lane he would take the second one or she there be female hero as well be they call heroine well i would not want to call anyone a dangerously addicting drug that would be sexist i mean play lina be pretty addicting though fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire its like if you have a charmander and combine it with a jynx that s what lina be which remind me that pokemon recently come out x and y be pretty popular with my friend so i wamt a 3ds those thing cost money though but i head i can trade my item for cash that sound pretty amazing earn money while palying games its like the american dream for people who do not want actual job not that i have a job yet all i do be stay home and read manga which be pronounce mane gah like mango but with an a i sometimes forget myself and add a false accent though and pronounce it mahn gaaaa so offlane be the lane opposite of the safe lane so the dangerous lane as they would call it it be not very safe cause you cross the mystical safety river to fight bad guy its like chinese vampire and run water i do not think they can cross run water many they would have a hard time with modern day plumb one flush of the toilet and the go poof or do they i actually know nothing about chinese vampire i only know vampire from the book my friend lend me it be the twilight saga i really prefer the jacob to the other guy though i be pretty upset when bella make the wrong choice i mean who would not want a guy you could play fetch whenever you want plus the other guy be like 439434 year old yuck so support be the last job you can play not only do you provide moral support because most team do not ever have asupport but you also help buy buy item no one else in their right mind would buy like a slave donkey to carry your item for you he can even be give magical wing for more than his actual buying price why would not i want another donkey instead of one fly one i be pretty sure two donkey be cool than one fly one i mean how would you even catch a flying donkey it could poop from like 60 foot and it would be awful like a divebombe terrible smell equine terror but donkey be pretty cute so keep them on the ground if donkey be mean to fly god would have evolve them wing instead of use magic so that be dota its a pretty good game but it have some problem too after all even blt have ts here be the digusting part of the blt game take a while to finish so if you tend to have sudden gas attack like me you may have an accident while you be play a particular game a game of dota can last from as long as 30 second to 50 hour like i be not even joke how troublesome it be to stay on the toiler for over an house to finish my game of dota i mean look at my avatar that be my face for like the first 5 minute of dota before my leg fall asleep and i start get cramp it also have too many different hero i think the game could cut its hero count down to about 7 it would also encourage fast hero pick if the last 3 player could not choose any hero it be a definitely annoying to choose the tree hero and the enemy hero pick an all fire team and the lumberjack hero you be literally counterpicked because you choose too early it would be well to give some kind of gold option or a repick option some game mode take forever like captain draft can be much short if they remove all the ban sometimes i want to make team electric but then a ban come up and i accidentally ban mr thunder or the masked electric emo then team thunder be ruin i can understand why ban could be good though cause everyone choose fat butcher guy he use his hook to hug you then you smell him to death sometimes he tickle you for extra damage what be bad be that he eat you he get fat and strong the big tomato of the problem be the fact that the game have too much action but not enough story its like bad than dynasty warrior when it come to story i could use a few cutscene tell me why i be team up with a giant spider a porcupine a baby rock and a angel man at least there be a reason in dynasty warrior 7 about why i be fight guan yu with my hated enemy the filthy wu be those filthy wu actually even man the way they fight with their cowardly fire arrow and powerful navy instead of face the numerically and superiorly lead enemy army head on just scream uncultured barbarian so i think i will give the game a 1 10 14 its a pretty good game but the lack of story give it only a 1 in that category i understand that every hero have its own lore but the big connection be quite lost when i team up with my big rival against my good friend a 10 grade for the excellent team spirit of the game people play like man instead of filthy wu woman but ali why the 14 and not a 17 because the game have that huge tomato and i hate tomato i love blt without the t bl be the great invention of man till someone introduce the uncessary t i would have bl everyday if i could afford it but i have no job and spend all my time read manga,pos
early access reviewafter be a magic player for 20 year this be the close there be to a digital competetive well designed and good look tcg it take a while to get immerse but the reward system be much more generous than in any other tcg you can easily get start with a decent deck and improve it over time the monthly event be also great as they cost the same amount of gold to play as if you would just buy the booster you recieve meaning there be no reason at all to not take part and play them the community be also great especially with sharing deck tech and new strategy overall greatly recommend,pos
early access reviewuber pay2win very unbalanced i almost buy premium but now i be glad i do not edit33hrs of gameplay still think it be pretty unbalanced tank plane spawn camper vs team with nothing specially for people just start maybe they try to get new people to get premium early the game be not bad but not worth buy pricy premium item if it would be a one time deal and without shortcut for anyone then i would spend some money but since it be not i would recomend the game to one with deep wallet or ton of free time i do not know either editcomment from r e t ard will be remove,neg
early access reviewmana flood and mana screw ruin this game there be of course mana fixing card and creature that help you ramp but you need to draw them or get lucky and have them in your open hand even after that there be no garuntee you will not just get flood after get your ramp and fix nothing bad than lose a game because you get to 10 power turn 5 or 6 and all you draw be mana for 8 straight turn or your hand be full of 8 drop and you be stick at 2 mana even aggro deck be not immune to flood and screw it be very frustrating,neg
that skill tree be huge but the actual amount of choice be limit some call this game path of life node because if you do not pick a ton of life node chance be you will be a weak leaf unable to resist the slight breeze by the time you get to the third difficulty that say the game do a number of force skill tree reset over the last year and it be a pain to have to restart such a huge build every time then again it be nice to be give the freedom to do so because like many other i completely mess up my build by not hold to the life node rule glass cannon come to mind all in all it be a great game many time better than diablo 3 and free to boot and good of all unlike most f2p game the dev of this game have a strict no pay to win ever rule anything you can buy in this game be decorative extra inventory slot cool special effect and pet totally worth it because the game be fair to all player,pos
from a great game to a money grab i play this game even back in beta and a lot have change from a great idea to this you have to grind for hour just to get a upgrade after that you play for another upgrade without pay for the game its a grinder even though i do not really mind grind this be just stupid,neg
its pretty cool as far as free game go i just wish it let you unlock more thing like class coin for free instead of have to pay real money i like the grindyness of it because its not to hard to grind for new wepon item etc i would play it more if it have some more depth into the menu and the like waaaaaaaaaaaay better on ps4 than it be on computer simply because you do not need to make a glyph account and the control be a bit easy to learn on ps4 it also run extremely smooth on ps4 basicly just get trove on ps4 game rating at the game current status on ps4 7 out of 10 star,pos
a really good strategic card game set in the world of elder scroll fully playable without pay real money but if you really want to get specific hero and card you may have to pay up login reward give you in game currency to buy pack though overall a great card game and if compare to say hearthstone this game have much more to offer in my opinon,pos

early access reviewthis be a review for the last 7 month as a whole come from 700 hour on g arena and 60 on steam in this review i will focus on 3rd person because that be the way it be originally intend and as such that be what i stick to this game firstly be build on a great engine with solid shooting mechanic no dsync nightmare very generious loot table and just an all around a polished and stable game in the new pioneer server you have a choice between 3 different loadout that be unique and change the way you can approach certain engagement the hang glider with limited backpack space but great to get across swath of land and get on enemy rooftop oh yeah and you can shoot an smg while glide very hand ythe snowboard with medium backpack space great for speed away to zone or down mountain also you can pull sweet trick off by hold jump key before a ramp life formation in the world the third pack be a climbing kit which you can use to scale mountain and also include a zip line motor attachment you will find zip line scatter across the map to traverse it also have the large backpack space avaliable hint you can hold about 75 more wieght by equip a bulletproof vest each pack include a weapon to give you a fighting chance if you spawn next to an enemy which bring us to spawn in game which be grid base choose your location this be a change from most battle royale by not use a parachute mechanic to pick your location this in my opinion if much fast to get in game without the fuss of wait to land a very welcome inclusion when spawn in my friend and i have notice in game lag for a few second nothing major just everyone spawn in and the game catch up but do not let that put you in dispair because overall the game i feel be very well optimize for a beta decent option in menu to customize control and graphic but do not expect alot of visual flair it be serviceable but not to 2018 quality expectation i will take gameplay that be fluid over ray tracing level of eye candy any day though the game play as most battle royale with a few new twist to it such as move zone be govern by ice cold weather call the ymir and will deal damage over time to an increase effect it will cover your screen in ice add to the effect that your in an ice storm your gun will also have ice and snow on them which be a nice attention to detail that i appriciate the end game be where the meat of the game be it be not as stressful as 1v1 in pubg be sometimes because this time you have a helicopter that will land in a designate area that will be mark on the map 4 people can board but that will rarely happen because it will be a sniper hotspot pick off enemy climb the ladder to board the helicopter most of the end game rely on your medkit to last you til you and the last people can not take anymore damage and try to board the heli it be a cat and mouse game and be fun but often repetative because it be less skill and more on who loot more medkit and can wait out the ymir the long overall it fit with the narrative that tencent be push with this game which i feel be a nice change to the regualar br fair you will find bit of story scatter around the map that will tell you what people be do at the time before have to leave after spend the majority of this year play this game i can say it be my favorite battle royale it be refresh it work and have a bright future with dev that be on the ball when it come to push update and feature give it time you will be in for a good run with this game thank you tencent and roe dev,pos

i highly recommend against download this game first off it be microtransaction hell you have to pay for everything the game be also pay to win bad whenever you die you either have to wait a certain amount of time or pay to respawn the game be very buggy and break i have be kill by zombie before i even spawn in and they want me to pay to respawn the damage registry be pathetic i have have several time where i would shoot a player in the head multiple time and they would walk away also the car be extremely broken and laggy someone can get in a car and lag all over the map run everyone over for free the player movement be terrible the character be extremely slow and stamina run out extremely fast it be free to play so it be obviously not go to be great but even on f2p game this be bottom tier,neg

this card game be just fantastic easy to learn but hard to master good strategy and tactic require but the learning curve be nice and easy you have a choice to represent a good number of race which have their own deck the single player game be so involve and have so many facet that i just will not bother play another card game not really into play people too many ego problem but there be more than enough in single player to keep you interested art style be nice with voice over element do to perfection the board layout be do well and good of all you do not need to spend a dime to have a lot of fun the only card game you need to play put an arrow in the knee in all the other card game out there outstanding 10 10,pos
well i really enjoy the game the problem i have with it be 1 i really hate cheater i have a lot of game experience so its easy for me to detect a cheater and i have be see cheater in about 30 of the gamesusually aimbot and esp extrasensorial perception for example a plane that be aim consistently against infantry while the fighter should not see the soldier from the air and in the mid game he have 30 infantry killedno matter if you hide in the bush or infantry who be kill everyone without even take coveri think dev be do their good against cheater but i also think its not enought 1 3 of game infest by cheater be too much the other problem i have be 2 the nerfe ptrd 41 it worth nothing i have be able to destroy tank consistently from a range of 5 10 meter but what s the matter to get so close with a very restricted weapon of 1 shoot where you need to hit 3 4 time to destroy a light tank when there you can use antitank grenade wich only take 2 equipment slot while the ptrd take 8 absurd if you shoot from 50 100 meter its almost sure you will miss no matter if you be prone the ptrd 41 be a very long weapon with a very big and heavy ammo so it should have a very decent accuracy but for now this weapon worth nothing in fact the at grenade be a lot more efficient than this supose at rifle 3 what s really the problem with reto moto the problem be that the rich boy that play for america be continuosly complain about this and other weapon and reto moto be so eager to please them that s the reason why americans win almost 90 of the war,neg

i have honestly be play and have fun on smite for many year now but recently it have become a pain to get on because you get one of three thing that will happen and if your not lvl 30 atleast your guarenteed to deal with it first you deal with toxic plaer who just ruin the experience by screw the match in multiple way second you have people who will just up and leave if they die more than once which screw the match for you most of the time and really start put you off of it and third and finally there be some seriously bad game break bug that make it hard to even want to play it and this be come from a beta player now if you can get a team to play with every match it take out most of the problem but everyone be not always available which make the likelyhood of have to deal with these issue more and more this be my personl opinion after play this game on pc and xbox,neg
the real diablo 3 very enjoyable experiance arpg i originally back this in the closed beta stage and the game have go a long way since then highly recommend to anybody to try it,pos
to me trove feel like the developer get a few inspiration from minecraft and a few inspiration from terraria and apply this to a common mmo formula with a fair business model that be play to win and pay to look fabulous with decent crafting time and a ton of other stuff of course you get to work for all that you have and want to acquire but still it be very much fair however trove shall not be compare to either of the aforementioned game as trove pose something inherently different and set itself apart with multiple feature or the merging of feature but i be get ahead of myself if you want to skip the lengthy part of my review you may skip to the pro and con i have list below to get us start what about trove lore and story well as far as i be concern there be none a goddess split the world into multiple infinite realm for you to explore venture into slay dangerous foe and collect ton of loot and level up so trove have in my eye the nessecary thing to be an electronic video game provide fun and entertainment also talk with a few community member reveal that most of the player be not too concerned about the lack of lore as trove be almost 100 about gameplay so let us switch to the gameplay trove gameplay have multiple aspect i be go to pick apart one after the other start off with character creation and the character creation in trove be very simple pick one out of 11 possible class at the start of the game and choose a hair style and a race to go with it however hair style and race be purely cosmetic and do neither benefit your character nor do they influence gameplay in any way whatsoever for instance i make a female robot ice sage class character a robotic mage base on ice with a nice female hair style hair and eye colour may also be choose though there be only a few select colour you may choose as a new player you will be most likely concern with the follow building raid dungeon for loot and xp level up and customize your character a little more in term of building there be in every world that be generate and the game throw you in so call cornerstones the cornerstone system work like this it be a plot of land that be 16x16 block in size that you can claim upon claim a basic starter house with basic equipment spawn on your cornerstone you can customize your house any way you want build up to 150 block high for tower enthusiast like me and the stone be the only place apart from club world club be the guild in this game which have their own world that you can shape the way you want it where what you build get save and nobody can grief your stuff as it be protect on your little plot of land and you can switch to another cornerstone which then trigger the buildup of your house there and the wiping of your house from the previous one in essence you get a portable base then there be raid lair there be 3 type of lair small large and recipe lair the latter be use to craft furniture every lair feature a boss in case of the large lair it be 3 boss and every boss drop a chest with loot in it speak loot there be no armour in this game only class skin however the game have weapon mask and hat with unique style base on the biome you have find them in there be 12 biome in total with entirely different theme and you be able to build your house around say theme if you wish to anyway upon get well weapon you may think geez i sure wish i could keep the style of my previous weapon and apply it to my current weapon well you can with the loot collector you can and kinda must build to advance your game experience and collect style for the multiple item upon collect style you get valuable resource but a lot of resource also have to be mine and acquire through drop or the gardening profession and mastery point the mastery rank be a different scale compare to your classs level you have to level each class you get individually get you more mastery point where as your mr mastery rank carry over to your whole game experience what do you do with all the resource craft and build trove feature multiple craft station for multiple profession that either unlock powerful item stylish new block for you to build with and reward you with mastery point upon level up your skill your mr also reward you with stuff such as storage currency stat upgrade that carry over to all of your class and item the profession involve ringcrafte runecrafting gardening fishing and build the latter do not award you mr point however other stuff include but be not limit to mount ally that give passive bonus boat to ride on the sea sail for your boat mag rider another form of mount and much more now switch to the term variety here be some gripe i get about trove the enemy variety be barely present of course every biome have its unique enemy and with unique look and sound but the overall variety in term of attack pattern and ability of say enemy just be not there much basically you will be fight the same enemy over and over again with a different skin save for the shadow realm boss of course which be in more advanced world then the class abilitie each class have four abilitite two of which have to be unlock with progression through level in my opinion this be not enough combat variety but i speak with some community member and it reveal that the majority of player actually do not mind that too much as trove main focus be not combat because to me trove have no main focus so to speak as you can do a myriad of other thing within the game another thing that get me disappoint a bit be the music do not get me wrong the music in itself be fine by me but it be almost never present when you enter a new biome the biome specific music play for a minute then stop for about half an hour and start play again this be not much for such an explorative game like this i dare say what i love about trove be the amount of biome there be and the possibility to style everything even your character with a specific biome in mind as well as the amount of possible block for build your house another thing that i find really neat be the tooltip for almost every item as they in the majority of case reveal how to acquire them you can view all available item in the game in a certain list default press y and check out that stuff and the tooltip for every item almost all of the time tell you how to get them this be pretty neat as it reduce the amount of time i have to ask somebody or look it up in a wiki one last thing the dev they punch out so many update and server maintenance to ensure everybody get a good gaming experience if they notice there be a persistent issue with even a small percentage of player they warn us beforehand and then get right to it by shut down the server and solve the problem in my opinion that be good work but now off to the pro and con pro vast world to explore with a lot of variety in landscape fly hop on a boat or ride your mount ability to style your equip the way you want ability to have your own personal world for yourself a portable base of operation that you can customize the way you want with a variety of different block great development team so far fair business modelcon lack in enemy variety lack in musical presence lack in class ability variety get some resource may get tedious lack of combat varietywould i recommend this game i have a ton of fun with it so far so yes totally and it be free it be not like you be pay anything so give trove a try today,pos
i really like elder scroll legend the play style be familiar enough for old school ccger to jump right in but they have create a great learning curve for new player to cut their tooth on the art for each card be excellent so far the balance in game seem very good some of the story level be difficult and may require several try to defeat but once you figure out how the opponent deck play it be easy to form a strategy to counter i will definitely be play this for a while,pos
early access reviewplease with the result of this br so far hirez have always be good about make quick adjustment to initial balance issue ie new god be op in smite paladin i be a huge fan of no fall damage as it create a more frenetic game pace look forward to see more in the future with classs ability and reward glad to also see them not come out with a bunch of cosmetic and instead get down to improve the game,pos
just an overview really i would score this 7 10 i have this on ipad too pro well flesh out progression system will literally last you forever no need for micro transaction if you do not want them sync with kongregate cloud enable cross device play con literally no sound at all anywhere super repetative can be boring as in the beginning not a lot go on on the screen difficult to see when thing have update,pos
play many hour on the bethesda launcher so my hour play be inaccurate big fan of esl and in my opinion be currently the good ccg at this time it be very similar to hearthstone as many point out but personally feel like it improve on a lot of aspect over hs certainlly more tactical and be less rng base card wise a free story mode with custom deck and choice which reward you with different card one of the strong point in the game and one that i prefer over the solo adventure from hearthstone new story mode be pay for unfortunately but from what i have see these mode be a lot more interactive compare to hs quirky straightforward adventure 50 card and up to 3 copy of non unique card mean more dust soulgem need but only 1200 for legendarie the game be quite generous with it be pack however and reward come quicker and more frequently ie 3 win reward the solo arena along with the multiplayer arena the solo arena be great and feel like an extension of the story mode where you face ai but they tend to have an advantage in various way and have theme deck the lane system be a welcome addition usually there be a standard lane which be a normal lane and a shadow lane where creature basically have stealth against attack except spell and you can not attack across lane this feature mean a lot more strategy be require on creature placement the rune system be something i have mix feeling about on one hand it make the game a lot more tactical and calculate instead of go all face all the time but card draw be not too rewarding which be where prophecy come in for those unaware each player have 5 rune and break for every 5 health increment and each time one be break you get a random card draw prophecy card can be play for free if draw this way it be extremely satisfying get a prophecy but with 50 card minimum deck it be super rng base and be just inconsistent the class system and flexibility with card be a welcome addition a lot of freedom when it come to deck build beautiful and consistent art and design a lot more intricate and mature very similar to mtg artstyle i be write a review to support this game as it deserve more attention and a large playerbase underrate game,pos
i play this game way back when raven be new in the na server the game be very enjoyable but be sadly drown in microtransaction that will effectively make you strong than anyone that be not spend money on the game or p2w i think i would try pick it up again because i use to play it a ton with some friend of mine but i just can not get back into it the community be also pretty childish at time and can be rather rude too tl dr game be good but p2w element and community really ruin the fun,neg

early access reviewi would not recomend this to anyone within the region of asia as they have not make an asia server yet the game be pretty massive with great potential to beat pubg but as it be right now its not even worth the time as someone who be from asia u can only choose 3 type of server right now euus eeuonce they make an asia server i be sure there will be more player base than there be now,neg
early access review40 hour playtime builder review note feel free to skip my backstory and head straight to the pro and con as someone who put a lot of time into minecraft a very similar game and stop play for a while after the project lose my interest creativerse do not really call to me at first after run out of steam for my usual casual multiplayer however i be coax into give it a go it be either that or minecraft and there be only so many time one can redownload minecraft and optifine and get connect texture work with your desire aesthetic before you start to scream regardless of my hesitancy i jump headfirst into a surprisingly pleasant few hour after give myself some time to explore the world fight mechanic power mining building and explore all but one layer of the world i can safely say that creativerse be a step in the right direction for the block sandbox game genre especially where building be concern i will focus on that aspect for my 40 hour playtime review as i primarily craft and build in addition to be a fan of building and game i be also an artist with a background in graphic design if some of this come across as more of an art critique or design note that would be why hope fellow builder find this review helpful pro lot of block to discover and craft all block can be rotate this include furniture lighting etc unlockable craft block be unlock in craft tree via discover and craft no guess the recipe either the recipe be available in your crafting menu as long as you have unlock that particular tree or pick up the recipe in a chest while explore texture be beautifuly detail seriously though check out some of the texture on the wiki from fancy diamond door to subtle obsidian ore they really give it their all in that department that be say i be not comepletely satisfied with the texture and i will explain that in the con section biome be very atmospheric and come with their own ambiance through the audio visual and mechanic the dripping from the cave ceiling really give splunking that extra boost of excitement biome also have their own region specific creature of both docile and hostile variety mistake honestly i feel like make mistake and experiment with building do not put as much of a dent on your mining tool and resource as play around in minecraft survival do there be no pickaxe in creativerse instead you have a glove with different level of mining cell they can be expensive to make but they last a lot long con craft tree texture i love the craft tree the system not the flora i love that craft a block unlock other recipe i do not however like how block of the same recipe class look next to each other wood for example have several block type that i would like to use together as the base of a build wood half slab wood stair wood wall the wood stair be texture in a very high contrast way and be definitely in a different hue than the wood half slab wood half slab use a subtle wood floor texturing while the wood wall have very little texture at all together it look like kind of weird mesh of texture like three different artist on three different project design them and set them side by side not a lot of texture look good next to each other and a lot of block feel over design over textured too high in contrast i have trouble get particular build to work especially when go for a rustic nordic feel obsidian to me be the big letdown i would have like to use it as a dark metal framework for thing but the block be too saturated and edge towards a dark purple instead of a more neutral feel that say the limestone tree have some goregeous block and i really enjoy build with those half slab i think half slab in minecraft be the bane of my existence but surprisingly they do one simple thing that make all the difference in the world comepare to these little bugger minecraft halfslabs stack on top of each other and creativerse half slab do not this go for any other block you attempt to place on a bottom set half slab in creativerse set half slab on the top half of the block space be super easy with the rotate function however not be able to put a halfslab down to fill the gap under a stair or to break up a repetative pattern in the wall be super annoying for build they be basically only good for craft cover the floor and a few decoration touch very few comepared to if they stack what be on fire torch can not catch tree on fire they can not catch wood on fire they can not catch me on fire but my hay roof go down in the blink of an eye why the god be as displeased about the half slab discovery on my roof as i be apparently monster spawn monster spawn be a bit odd in this game i have see rock lobster on time out in 1x1 square in the wall i have see night pigsys fall from the heavens light up the night sky in their blue die fire nearly every hour my friend and i have to play where be the miru in our underground base because somewhere deep in the wall there be a 1x1 open space that a monster or two will spawn in a purr at us until we kill it and seal the hole more of a note than anything if you use too many natural block that have not be craft after be mine there be a chance that monster can spawn in that area my friend and i learn that the hard way after die several time behind closed door during bathroom break you have be warn conclusion all in all i have have fun in creativerse so far both as a builder and as an adventurer there be a lot of build that i want to try in a lot of different biome i have a lot of hope for this game its in early access still and my main complaint be just thing that could build this good game into a great one if you have some time and you have not already give creativerse a shot especially if you be someone who enjoy unlock material and create there be some bug worth note which i have detail seperatedly in the steam discussion board for creativerse but i have a feeling they will be fix in due time hope this be helpful to fellow imaginative mind happy building,pos

for the arcade beatem up fnatic elsword be classic 2 5d sidescrolling fight fun with ton of way to play just make sure you be ready to cough up a few dollar to keep look pretty the combat be insanely fun and you can pull off pretty lengthy combos with only slight effort however if you be not willing to pay you will literally be play in your underwear you think your character look cool it will not once the expiration date of your clothe come in not only do it cost money to not look like an idiot you have to pay a ton of money just to get item that you basically need to get ahead in this game and for that reason i have to give this game a negative score no matter how fun it be,neg
early access reviewthe only other br i have enjoy besides realm royale before the developer team absolutely butcher it it feel like a more polished and functional pubg but i will refrain from call it a pubg killer outside of the quirky but enjoyable movement system with snowboard and hang glider no one use the rock climb ability it be essentially what bluehole picture pubg could be once it be truly finish everything just work there be no clunkiness or choppyness vaulting over obstacle will not leave you jump flat against a wall for 3 hop before a vault trigger gun play be night and day difference compare to pubg where sometimes you feel like your bullet disappear in the air it just play and feel like a great shooter which be something that have be lack in the br genre this will definitely remain my main game until cod blackout release and then it will be my alterate br experience hopefully more and more people will give the game a chance despite the publisher i be hesitant to but every single quirk and original feature this game have grow on you quickly and you come to enjoy the game for what it be and not what it may become unlike every other br in existence,pos

it be important to remember that if you take a break from the game for any length of time they wipe your progress which be what happen to me and that pretty much end the game consider it be a pretty solid grind from gun to gun i be not go to start from scratch just because they do not want to keep a few byte of datum remember where i be in the tree i figure it be to encourage people to buy the lifetime access but that be pretty dirty,neg
early access reviewboth magic online and hearthstone would be well game if they be close to eternal it have the depth and complexity of magic and the accesibility and polish of hearthstone,pos

early access review18 october 2018 the late patch seem to be more inline with what most player and i wish the return of the class base gameplay more weapon and multiple balance change still far from perfect seem to try to pull this game to a well direction than the patch mention in the wall of text underneat while the patch still have some glitch or bug they seem to be try it to listen to the community feedback and to the fledged player base or at least that be what they want to portray if it be too late to save realm royale we will see at the moment be on the verge of be declare an unnoficial online dead game but seem to start build some traction yet again it be far from be what it be in term of playerwise or balance but be it go somewhere qs ar e still long with sometimes 10 minute q and only 2 region eu na hit registration with projectile weapon seem to behave bad if you be not play on your preffered region even if ping wise it feel the same as before the direction the game seem to go now could change at any moment if hi rez decide that this be not rack on the money or the player base for the moment i will change my review to recommended to try it be not a fully recommend title but if you want a free decent battle royale you can get into it an oppinion from a hardcoring decent realm royale playerone of the few br game i actualy feel good playing it regularly competitvely it be a unique take on battle royale that get under the radar for many gamer but i manage to catch it and get involved while it be not for everyone it be something unique that i really enjoy play the playerbase be not really big but you could get match in a matter of minute if not second the game even be wacky and sometimes unbalanced or have some what the hell happen there still keep me in and want to do play it more i play pubg like a lot but never involve myself in the game the market or the genre like in realm royale it feel close to perfect experience down down by some inconsistency slow develop time and too few class and weapon variety when i wish for variety i never expect that this be how realm royale will become after some controversial unnannounced untested patch go straight to live or to live after 1 day of existance on pts i be skeptical about the development cycle but afterhuge community backlash they kind of modify the patch and remove the issue even if be a bit later than wish while the gameplay becaim a bit stale in the last patch people play meta and the to op engineer at least for squad i still enjoy it and be a blast of fun time and rage time play with the people on discord i still be draw in unfortunately erez ceo of hirez decide that realm royale be bring money and it could do even more if they pull in some player the choice of pull in some people be make in detrimental to all actual and old realm royale player who put money into it and be also detrimental to the complete realm royal formula and to everything the game stand for uniqueness realm royale become a complete different game on pts and now on live one that try to emulate experience from an amalgan of battle royale game that have a big number of player actively while the community complain and try to provide feedback about what be wrong about the patch and how they should bring the old realm royale experience back or at least try to make some adjustment to the game that be as of now now completely different hirez erez decide to push the patch live the patch portray bug from previous version of realm royale and even lack of animation or legendary ability that be or be at the time of writing this break also erez ceo of hirez recently insult a high profile if not the high profile streamer competitive player of realm royale who be commentate in a negative manner about the last patch erez post to the live streamer play the game the way you be suppose to with a team and stop cry the direction of how this game go from an almost overnight sensation to a decent player base and now to a complete mess be abysal while i think that the old game could have be decently present in the market with some change new content drop and event now i be afraid that the game will die before it even get out of early access the console version have be put on hold and the duo or solo in the pc live environment be momentarly a work in progress after it have be pull out of the game in order to make it more competitive queue time be still decent at peak online time when both eu and na population be live but when try to play on eu when eu be on sleep or try to play on na when most of na be away or sleep be almost impossible with que taking plus 10 minute also play from another region only na and eu server have a ping that be competitively innefective especially with the projectile slow weapon eu and na server be the only one remain due to low player number on the other region like south america africa asia and australia even with one que squad but not be in a popular hour will make your wait for match a game who lose a lot of it be playerbase 94 from the time it launch in early access still retain a 3500 active concomitent player count daily now it struggle to maintain half of that tldr realm royale for me and for a lot of player be a game really unique fun enjoyable competitive with few issue in gameplay but some in balance still the developer try to balance the game at much as they could still ignore the comment of the playerbase be still a decent experience now erez ceo of hi rez just say a you to all player and decide to pull out every uniqueness of the game and basically modify the game completely that only look similar to what it be before they try to bring in more people by borrow concept from other game be more casual and easy to play they do not achieve nothing but they manage to drive off their playerbase and attract no one new or at least no one to overpass the big ammount of player that leave realm royale be a sad exemple of a game that be technically decent and have a unique style get destroy by corporate greed not listen to your playerbase and feedback and shell early access as a motivation to bring in the new change realm royale be one of the few game that have to change the entire steam page to reflect the new change and be one of the few game that change it be entire identity in the course of the early access period totalize 3 month at the time of writing while not popular it still have a population that could make this game last for at least 4 5 month more and with an actual drive force it could have become one of the well battle royale game now it be a graveyard hopefully soon someone will get fire for this disaster and they will pull out the sink ship if not it will go deeper and deep in the nothingness of time for what be worth i be happy for the purchase i make in old realm royale i receive cool item a semi interesting battle pass that keep me play and the tought of support the developer of realm royale but i never expect this to happen even if it be an early access i would have never put money in what realm royale be now even if i would have never play the old realm royale,pos
early access reviewi will buy the game at the regular price a lot of the negative review be from butt hurt who be salty typical mmo launch this game be not a genre change event though the combat be niche and hopefully they figure out the action combat system asap,neg
planetside 2 be a tough one to sum up first off you need a decent computer to run this because this game will kill you computer if it can not handle it it be a very cpu and gpu heavy game aside from that it be a joy to play unlike your typical shooter this game do not revolve around quickscoping and lone wolf if you do that in this game it will be a bad expeirience as you constantly die but it be not mean to be play this way a game like this need real co ordination with you squad and your outfit you must know what you be do in this game that s be crutial because this be a massive game with over 6000 people per server every team need to co ordinate the pay to win model be non existant in this game you can play without spend a dime and still kill player who throw down 15 a month for premium membership as for bug yes there be plenty of bug but soe be update this game every month they constantly look at what be wrong so far and try to fix it planetside 2 have the potential to be the top game for the next year or so since its free there be no reason why you shouldt try it note if you be plan to play this game with a medium to low end computer i recommend put the graphic to low and the render quality to 0 to maximize the frame per second,pos
early access reviewthe game be a little unbalanced when i start some wepons be a little over powered such as the proto seeker rail gun tesla and some wepons include building blocke be under power such as the plasma canon sheild laser basic cube but the consept be great you have robot level and every time you level i can not spell up you get 10 cpu which allow you to add extra matereal to your robot and you unlock an item or a set of item the consept of rp robopoint be confusing but the way you earn them and how much you earn be well think out every time you level up you usualy have enough rp to buy the new item sell unwanted item be well thoughout and fairly price and the dynamic movment of the tech you build be well create and handle by the game when the big update on april 28 come out rp be replace with robo bit and all wepon and building block be rebalance perfectly however this be a big however loot crate be a problem as they make robocraft look like other game like war thunder or pixle gun with a reward after fighting and a dayly reward but the main sad thing be that when you level up you do not unlock anything new besides cpu you can purchase everything right off the bat which remove the fealing of accomplishment if it become anything more like other game i will uninstall robocraft at that point its a waste of hard disk space to me i be so sorry but i be worry about the future of this game,neg
world of tank blitz be largely the same as world of tank which can be count as a old brother to blitz gameplay wise be quite similar with the old patch of world of tank physics gun shoot sound armour profile and etc both of them be f2p and grind the top tier 10 tank without any premium tank or premium account be possible as long as one play smart and save credit compare to warthunder blitz fall on the arcade type of game which be much easy to play and master than warthunder due to the more small learning curve although warthunder give a high sense of pleasure after you have fully master it the rather major difference compare to world of tank be the lousy graphic which mean a well frame rate for slow computer also one will note that unlike world of tank blitz do not have artillery or self propel gun because of its small map size fast gameplay and short match time which make implement arty impossible then people will ask will the developer implement artillery into the game next time the answer be no unless they make special match with long match time and big map which i think be not go to happen another point to note be that its fast gameplay make tank with a certain amount of mobility play more aggressively and become able to keep up with the pace of the battle much easy overall if you be look for a quick multiplayer tank game that be easy to play than world of tank then blitz be great for you if you be a hardcore fan of tank and would want to try something much harder then warthunder intermediate skill and f2p steel armour blaze of war high detail and big learning curve same for the other two list along with steel beast and steel fury kharkov 1942 be good game to try with thier high realism here be some tip for people who be start in blitz 1 take a look at the tech tree and see which top tier tank be appeal to you then plan which tank line you would want to take towards that tier 10 tank note that some top tier tank have only one tank line to choose 2 after that i would recommend people grind the russian medium tank line because they be rather easy and fun to play with or you can choose a tank line which have tank with good enough mobility like the be heavy tank line you can also choose not to grind any russian tank if you prefer snipe germany or would rather be a jack of all trade us it be the good to avoid the british tank line because they be one of the hard tank to play in my opinion 3 do not use premium ammunition as in ammo that can be buy for credit but in a very large amount of credit compare to your standard ammo either because they have high penetration against armour or deal more damage against enemy tank unnecessarily but only use it when you can not penetrate the enemy tank with standard ammo and etc also do not buy provison and camouflage for a tank you be use it to grind a hefty amount of credit as the result would most likely be a loss of credit or only a few hundred plus credit even if you have a great battle 4 lastly have fun and do not get angry about a match if ever in a bad mood take a break and play again later this can help you concentrate and perform well in battle 5 do not forget to learn technique to use your tank more effeciently you can find that out with the forum or youtube video world of tank forum and video also apply to blitz,pos
early access reviewthis be not a very good smash bros clone i use to think it be but then i think about how the character be different they be not everything be all the same there be no counter there be no reflect there be no charge move no wind up attack there be very slight difference in the attack but nothing unique i still do not mind play it every now and then but it be lack in so much,pos
early access reviewsimply one of the bad game i have ever play from one of the bad game developer i have ever come across within two day of launch they nerfe all class damage by nearly 50 yet paladins a support class can effectively solo every single other class due to stun lock and self heal which make the entire aspect of class balance a joke they also nerfe exp gain over all so the few lucky people that get to get onto the server within the first two day get to max level on several character while my one mage that get on four day in could only get to lvl 20 25 before quest run out force me to either dungeon grind or grind on mob for hour then they totally destroy one of the only enjoyable thing about mage ice snap see how they be paper and do not do anywhere enough damage for how squishy they be no one really play them anymore and i be p ssed that be the class i use the deluxe edition upgrade on total waste of money for the two dlc upgrade by the way see how everything be lock to one character then of course you have the pepper fiasco where everyone that secretly know about a hidden map with no monster get to go in and farm 8000 pepper to npc them so certain people be rich while everyone that do not know about the cheating zone can barely afford repair and new gear since the dungeon loot rng system be punish trash neowiz refuse to do anything about it so the economy be completely and totally off balance they should have do a hard server reset on at least three separate occasion the pet taming be a cool idea in theory but absolutely atrocious in execution the writing be on the wall with how pay to win the system will be especially if you have look into the other three yes 3 version of this mmo that have be release around the world once the game be out of early access if it get that far they will implement the p2w pet system mark my word it will happen it be just a matter of when then of course you have the p2w gear system where you need to farm gear and dismantle it for part to upgrade your shizz so you can spend a couple month farm dungeon to get the piece or you could just spend real money buy in game currency to buy gear off the auction house and have it in five minute rng be punish before assassin even come out their gear drop in every dungeon see how hard dungeon be after the across the board 50 damage nerf it be extra punishing to get the entire way through a dungeon just to end up with two assassin and one archer gear drop with none of either class be in the party or in game just absolutely atrocious game design on all front and it be never fix in any of the numerous fix of course i forgot to mention the over zealous forum mod that delete ban remove and punish people just try to give honest genuine criticism i have never in my life see a steam forum fill with such terrible power hungry mod that do everything in their power to silence people speak out about the game coffee be a prime example of be an absolutely abysmal mod it ban me for share information on the forum about the other version p2w system i be not rude nor insult just simply explain how p2w it be go to get and get ban for it for tell people to avoid it bad form mister coffee this game have not even be out for four month at this point and it be do so poorly it be already at a 67 discount not to mention hemorrhage the majority of it be playerbase that be nearly unheard of for good game to go on such a massive discount so fast that really should be your first clue that the game be flounder at this point it be a sink ship and not worth any amount of money to play avoid this game like the black death early access be really just an excuse to release a poor product see as how this be the fourth and fourth fail version of bless i be one of many people that ask for a refund after 30 hour and do not get one sadly even though many other do with even more play time i be absolutely p ssed i waste money on this trash scam should have do more research rather than be blind by shiny new mmoness 0 10 for bless and neowiz forum mod even at this point them add in the siren race and mystic class will not get me back permanently uninstalle stick to ff14 wow bfa or buy monster hunter world those game be actually worth your money,neg
while i do love this game there be a few problem with it pro fast and fun action especially with teammate the graphic while not groundbreake be pleasing to look at every character be fun to play as and bring something different to the table with ara and rena be my favorate there be a lot of good track in the game con the game will often encourage you to spend some real money on the game thing like costume extend skill slot pet etc game can get grind heavy later on not like maplestory grind heavy but in the very later dungeon you will need to do a few dungeon run before you can move on to the next mission overall i do like this game but i can say the microtransaction can be a turnoff for some if you be interested in try it play the game for a few hour maybe go to lv30 or something and then deside if it be worth invest a few buck update okay take a look at the price and i can say that some of these be insane i think spend around 25 for a single costume set be a bit much then again look at what we be pay unusual,pos
it be fairly new and i have only play about an hour of it but i really enjoy this and i usually do not enjoy trading card style game it be somewhere between mtg hearthstone and gwent it have the 2 color mechanic from mtg lane from gwent polish card forge system and turn grow magicka magicka from heathstone with an engrossing and full singleplayer campaign elder scroll lore its own spin on trading card game and a lot of polish pro free good story so far great card art and sound design a lot of polish the rune system be something i have not see before i love the idea of upgrade card as you get repeat the lane modifier be interesting story choice actually have a tangable effect on the card you be give for your deck not too computer intensive i have a macbook and do not notice any major hiccup each race have a different effect for your deck and pretty much all the race you be able to play in the main series game be represent and be able to be change at will a lot of in game statistic recordingcon not many card so far already have a 5th of the regular set in game transaction up to over 100 usd a lot of animation the art design for the campaign kind of look like those cheap point click adventure with the still image that they add effect to but it work for the game setting menu in game lackluster long loading time may just be my machine fairly lengthly unskippable tutorial it be basically necessary to sign up for a free bethesda account if you do not have one already its the first thing that come up upon start the game overall like i say before i do not usually do not like trading card game i do not like the meta of them of need every card however this one with its thurough optional single player campaign and load of polish really do hook me even though the pitfall of many tcgs be present it be very early so there be not many card i suggest you try it out i be very surprised by this one a lot of potential for this one i really suggest everyone try it,pos
early access reviewdid not exepecte anything from bless online but have be so dissapointed the studio do not even seem to know where they be go third release and still no idea awfull coommunication when you do not even try to explain what you be try to test without a clear way to report bug to give some point of view something be some kind of way pretty wrong when you be tell you be help into a beta and feel like this thing be release because of a stop date even after hour of playing do not find any good point to save too many point this game feel 15years late many bug into the game core can not use skill load texture allow to fall through the floor graphic use lot of ressource for pretty poor result seem they remove many thing just to fake a path to level up many place as mountain be just 100 empty the path finder try to make you go through oppsite faction camp be stick use the emergency reset option to be teleport pretty far away you need a emote ask other player if they have be find or russian japanese player take some note assassin not available to play you can still drop their stuff need to test stat impact hide remove dummy to let people make test military district try to be a pvp game do not give objective as duel an other class of your level when they have the reverse challenge there be a win a duel challenge but feel weird will people just agree to loose will people have to try to challenge unbalanced duel it feel so you do not know where you be lead the game make what you can to be sure people will not enjoy the experience right now the game be a kill thing to level up and be an harrasment for any low opponant you find well if you can outnumber them do it when anger take the lead you do bad thing and you feel dirty making other not enjoy a chance to do something make you get any kind of self satisfaction my bad i do not sorry i guess i be not enough a jerk maybe this part will be fix when there will be many bus of high level of each faction scout road but if i like to imagine that thing can self fix i have a doubt the pvp the purpose sell of this game be just a shame never play a so static game who be try to be dynamic not a good tab target not a good pure action just the bad of the 2 world a pain to target and not reactive for action you want to pvp why not use the battle zone everyone will be set lvl 45 but do not unlock the lvl 45 skill if you be not lvl 45 because it could balance thing the ui be just a shame dishonor to everything that have be do in other game just be able to see if your team mate be around you have to choose to show up health above player and just try to heal the hard way no stamina show sprint dodge action make guardian paladin even more static you will feel more like a aoe dodge deny class remainming stance switch class should be even small population on server do not seem balanced at all almost feel like 1 10 or more and people can not create your side good luck to explain the difference between create character play character be tell that the founder pack be up for a single character roll on floor so people should not even try multiple class be ready to pay for anything and you still have too much cash there will be cosmetic some very important feature be cash shop tactic be just more than confort but you have to pay for every character need inventory expansion need any confort you will pay for cosmetic later enjoy our way to make you learn you credit card number the feeling of the game right now you use the dungeon team search tool and get a group pay for dungeon teleportation 75 lumena every time you can in game farm 50 lumena per day with an inside mecanic for an insane amount so you pay the game you can pay and month fee and you still have to pay even more for anything electronic art be that you as not even get close to all trouble you exit a dungeon you will be set to the channel 1 in front of the entrance 2 choice your faction be outnumber the place you have to use a pvp disable item anyway even if you use a crowd control immunity to try to run back in 2 m you will be kill because it be just more fun this way i like pvp but when you be push to hunt for anyte low than you there be only shame in the player vs player spirit the adrenaline rush the i can do it no it be just a bus tour stomp tourist you will try to answer it be a beta not a beta it do not worth some fix the main matter be that there be no objective to reach for the dev like a frankenstein creature patch with thing see elsewhere not give the feeling they be master as a part of the game have be remove let us say for a well sight on test the lore be just the too many time see thing the level design be still try to understand what could have be the purpose not a pve mapping not a real pvp strategy with key place to control except maybe dungeon the race choice have some result on party buff available when team you can set buff the available one be a matter of race class in the group but to be direct never feel that race be just so useless not even charimatic some game do not have any race buff but you still feel like be part of something in this case it be just a single race any of the current available one would be enough the story do not care there be some not bad attempt but messia syndrom without any impact feel sad to say but the main story arc be the close thing to level point path all make level a fast but so boring thing and you do not even have to hope it will be build you master of your class the economy model be strange so much control on the auction house consumable be just very expensive to craft so afraid of gold farmer that be just feel lock in padlock bunch without idea of consequence the auction house do not have any stat filter good luck find thing that you could be try to fit for your class people do not want to rise a crafting skill at least they can collect ressource and sell them but in the end consumable be pretty expensive potion can be very usefull they be quite insane powerfull but it cost 2 kidney to keep a good stock up if not alchemist spirit be very very very powerfull upgrade but you may loose them on death so you should stack plenty be ready to spend a lot of money the last and one that can change the most in next day may be the gameplay start with a dynamic but 2 shot fight endgame to a static annoying game not plan to be very pve proof here the matter be that be just insane strong unexpected and may have need more explanation come on some dungeon be almost not possible to do because people do not know how to take the path the dev want to try for that point i have a doubt about that dev team have a plan strategy some huge matter have be solve such have not have a true multiple attempt to connect with a result of static screan without any idea of what be happen some unbalanced skill have be fix but so much remain last word i hope that many thing will be fix some way that bless online will not be remebere as a full failure 3rd release attempt and still no idea about what it should try to be not because i believe bless online could be a great game but because it feel like people could be less enthusiastic in futur game and i want to believe that some other dev will have some respect for player pay the game pay a month fee kind and you still have to pay for feature,neg

this be a moba game what else could i say about it i be pretty sure you have read a bunch of review upon dota before come to this review get straight to the point that this game be probably worth play if you be interested in face individual across the internet with the probability of be skilled in tactic and strategy these strategy and tactic be accomplish via the vast cast of character within dota each with their own set of ability role most character be not confine to their specificed role and give a wide variety of item that can produce a devastating or riduculous combination that will cripple the enemy team if you be up to play this game let it be discern that how you interact with your teammate be vital in your aim to win the match against the oppose team an example of what i mean would be communication within this game you will not always be pair with individual that you will be on equal footing with however you and the other person that comprise your team will have to compromise to make of what you can to achieve the same goal to win in addition aside how you communicate with another you could gain idea of how to play a certain character plot ingenius tactic and enjoy the sensation of teamwork result from communication leave off on one final note remember that every loss within dota show be a gain via reflection see what have be do wrong or have not be do at all with your comrade and together offer strategy and suggestion for future match do not let the loss of a match get to your head always remain composed and level head,pos

great moba if you be into mobas like league of legends smite hon etc then give this a try it be free and it be damn good first off a warning you be go to suck oh you have some experience with mobas oh in that case you be go to suck and getatmatmatmatmatmatmatmatm dota 2 have a pretty long learning curve load of hero to choose from and heap of item to go along the training system be a precious help and introduce you to the last hit deny shop for item and combine item allow you to play with a few noob friendly not easy and not weak than the other one mind you just not that complicated to master in the early stage of the game hero to get you to feel the game pace from then on you still have a lot to learn everybody can use all hero for free and there be no advantage anyone have over you except their own experience in the game but there be plenty of hero to go around and until you have play them all or play against them at least once you will be feel like a noob when you face one for the first time dota 2 be rather unforgiving when it come to carry you die you lose time experience and gold and you need gold to buy item to allow you to carry not that easy for support either most of them do have the uppoer hand on some carry on the early stage of the game but you need to know them in order to take advantage of that also your ability damage do not really scale all that well to late game where the carry start to shine there be dozen of ward spot jungling trick and control point you need to master every game different lane be pretty unpredictable at dota 2 you can have 2 1 2 but you can have a 1 1 3 a 1 2 2 or if you have some jungler you can have 1 1 1 2 os something like that the game pretty dynamic do check some guide and build they can help you in your first contact with some hero but hey it be dota 2 everythings situational sure there be a few core item on many hero but all in all it all depend on the game you be play and a change can make all the difference again if you be into mobas do try it now,pos
fun game at the start then you realize it have a kind of pay to win and still some bug to work out its okay but i can not reccomend it love the skyrim world that it be set in but its not enough to make up for the poor match make and the un randomness of the card,neg
i have play this game for 5 year on their internet client and it be be great over the year i expect great thing from deca and i reccomend this game to anyone who be look for an great game to play solo or with friend,pos
its a shame the looting be addictive and see a human in the distance give a huge adrenaline rush but that s really all that be good about this game maybe i would enjoy it more if the game do not crash every 15 minute or if there be not gun literally everywhere make killing for loot much less rewarding or if there be some sort of animation for healing so that people could not heal themselves as i be shoot them same thing with riot shield it be ridiculous how much of an advantage those give you when it work it be fun but those time be too few and far inbetween,neg
after play this game for 116 hour i can not recommend this to anyone who be not willing to either spend the 50 euro for all possible overpower card that you acquire only via story quest which cost real money or lose hundred and hundred of time to get enough card to get enough in game shard that allow you to craft good card not the overpowered pay card tho,neg
really great game control be easy to use or modify for personal style the texture be really nice and clean and the block selection be beautiful and ever grow the tech device add so many option to decorate or even build with so many good thing about this game especially the fact that it be free the pro key will be worth it to some but maybe not to other it add some very useful and handy feature that help with build big and crazy build 10 10,pos

early access reviewoh boy aq3d how i wonder what the hell happen to you disclaimer i be not hate on ae fyi i play many of their game except oversoul and epic duel also terrible grammer aheadaq3d in general feel really lack in their content compare it to aqw and story department compare it to df and aq let me give you the break downin aq they do great with the story and make it be tie to aqw not only that in aq we actually have a really good reason and etc reason why we fight who we be and many more in df their story line be amazing the character be lovable relatable and a good character overallin aqw we have over 50 class to choose from and every class have a specific combo play style etc but in aq3d jesus christ the story be a mess content be lack the character be 1d at bad and 2d at best basically not good so overall i give it 6 10 in the future if they add more class maybe i edit this review but until then the rating be not go to change,neg
this be the most money demand game i have ever find basically you spend hour and hour of do the same thing over then the bad part the luck if you wanna get something good do not expect it since everything have to be super rare force people to buy over price package also if your try to buy something that they do not have a pack for good luck the pack range from 10 100 there be very few 10 pack though this game be p2w pay to win since everytime someone buy something in the 100 pack they get something although for those who buy a small pack that have like 1 10 super rare chest your not get anything the good chance you get at get something good be 75 chest i would not recommend this game since it demand so much time and work put in to it do the same thing over and over now every few week the dev add another new item or pack that have exsclusive item that player want that can only be obtain by buy for anyone that plan on play this just know that you eventually end up buy something and regret it,neg

in short the game matchmaker be very unbalanced to put it in perspective most of the match i have play i take my tank that be develop at the end of ww2 1944 45 out in a match and be put up against cold war tank also get new vehicle without premium and in some case with premium take an ungodly amount of time the only way to effectively grind out a new tank be to purchase a premium account and play a premium vehicle of the high tier if you do not spend money you be 10 step behind everyone that do,neg
with hundred of hour of playtime and dozen of way to customize your game this be easily one of the good idle game ever make the update be fairly frequent and always add lot of new content and event i highly reccomend this game to anyone who like idle game,pos
early access reviewa true free to play game though any character can be bring for 5 they can also be pay for with free in game currency which you can get small amount of in rank match or large amount from daily log in and daily mission as of write this i have play for 32 hour and i own 4 character that i earn entirely with in game currency 2 from the cheap tier 2300 coin 2 from the 2nd most expensive tier 5400 coin with 6 free character every week from a roster that currently include 19 character and be still grow you have ample oppurtunity to sample character before you buy them the only thing you can not get for free be purely cosmetic change such as skin taunt a true smash bros style brawler that have its own charm and a cool weapon mechanic that give you 2 different option for fight movement style for every character fun to play with friend a must own free to play game,pos

early access reviewsome issue i have with this game imbalanced high variance play this be like play roulette you can win lose even against more powerful weak deck just base on draw poor ratio between mythic and rare basically most of the powerful card that you be go to need for a deck be mythic level due to the 75 land per deck and just the 1 mulligan and the presence of the mana system you can get so easily mana flood or screw from this point of view they break the mtg equilibrium poorly design mechanic aside from the one steal from mtg,neg
early access review the gun feel bad than their equivalent in paladins the third person view do not work well with this game so i hope thhe developer add a first person option the game do not look that good even at max settings movement feel bad especially jump the game allow for only 2 gun slot which mean that you can not have a gun for all low mid and high range combat the class system do not work all that well and feel poorly design would recommend stay away from the game until its full release,neg

update june 30 2017 if you be or be a fan of blizzard hearthstone but despise blizzard then this be your light at the end of the tunnel a masterpiece card game that raise the bar for the genre to yet unsurpassed level of excellence truly an ultimate achievement from the guy who bring us the elder scroll all of the lore be in this game the racial element and all of the awesome sauce from the rpgs make it a great experience to play addicting as hell so beware once you start play do not expect to be able to walk away if you have a background in mtg or hearthstone then this will be simple for you to get go and to be able to compete in a short amount of time hero of skyrim have be introduce and it be pretty impressive the only bad thing be that this do not increase the playerbase of the game it still hover between 3k 5k or low depending on offpeak time the reason for this problem be up to the developer to fix hopefully they will find a way to resolve thing and get this game to a pinnacle of glory where it so deserve to be,pos
  this may be one of the best free to play game on smartphone in my opinion and here it be on steam roughly 2 year after the original release with its gameplay be build room and later upgrade them for more resource for your vault somewhat similar to something like clask of clan in that way upgrade room and even rush them do not require nuka cola quantum aka the game premium currency instead room will upgrade the instant you purchase it with the game basic currency cap the mechanic to rush room to get the resource instantly be a great idea and it work well in the game basically rush a room have around a 30 chance of fail and it increase by 10 each time you do it the counter will go back down to 30 if you allow the room to work naturally if the rush fail there will be a disaster in the room ie a fire or a radroach infestation if that s the case the dweller more on them in a second assign to the room will have to douse the flame fight off the radroache for the dweller aspect you must rebuild civilization by allow dweller to become member in your vault each dweller have a set of s p e c i a l skill s for strength p for perception e for endurance c for charisma i for intelligence a for agility and l for luck dweller high in strength can work best in the power generator room which be vital for power your vault dweller high in perception work well in diner which supply food for your vault dweller high in endurance can work well in storage room dweller high in charisma do well with well talk charisma only affect male female converse with someone of the opposite sex which will end up cause the female to become pregnant and after 3 or so hour will birth a new child which he then grow up to become another worker in the vault dweller who have high intelligence will work best in medbay or science lab where they can produce medkit and antiradiation pack dweller high in the agility stat can work well in the water treatment room which supply water to the vault then luck affect the rush mechanic allow the chance of a disaster to go down a little bit strong dweller be also very capable of venture out in the wasteland give a dweller a weapon which help them during radroach infestation or raider invasion will allow the dweller to survive in the wasteland out there he can find cap gun and outfit which will help stat for dweller and return them to the vault combat in the game be simplistic dweller will automatically attack threat and fight fire its your job to heal them though if they will not survive you can assign them to another room so they can flee and survive if they die you have 24 real life hour to revive them with cap which can be handy when you reach 18 dweller you can build the overseer office which allow quest to be unlock quest be like send dweller out into the wasteland except you select 3 which meet the quest requirement i e level and weapon power and you send them to a certain location which can take anywhere from 1 hour or 21 hour in real time to speed this up you can use nuka cola quantum when they arrive at their destination they travel as a group and will fight enemy however combat in quest be very different from regular battle in the vault and it be in my opinion a little hit or miss if dweller walk into a room where there be enemy they be lock into fighting and can not flee i learn that the hard way so if you intend on do quest i strongly advise pack ton of stimpack aside from that combat be a bit deep it be still simplistic but you can tell which dweller should target what enemy and there be a random chance a checkmark crosshair will show up above an enemy which once click pause the game and enter a timing minigame where you must click the crosshair when it be as close to the center as possible do so will give a critical hit that be 5x more powerful than the basic attack quest do however offer a chance to score ton of loot that can be use later in crafting which i myself have not reach yet side note if you have play a fallout game you will most likely recognize a ton of familiar aspect of the game as the game in my opinion stay very faithful to the fallout franchise in term of style and presentation if you enjoy fallout game or free to play game in the style of craft room and ect you will most likely enjoy this game whether it be for steam or smartphone i give it 4 5 star if you do plan on play this game i hope you enjoy it u,pos
fractured space seem to consistently be refer to as a moba and while it technically be it be sort of a stretch two team face off try to capture the other base that be about it so far and be the essence of its moba classification that make it a bit boring especially if the team you end on do not adjust their ship to complement the other that be really the only negative i can see with fractured space which be a rather big deal since it be pretty much the game mode you be go to play the other extra add up to make it a solid f2p game though at 39 99 to unlock all 31 ship be not outrageous and they go on sale for 19 99 from time to time the graphic be excellent and the add battle chatter from your crew add to the immersion although i know million of life be lose to your incompetence everytime i die i recommend fractured space since it be free to play and you have nothing to lose,pos
early access reviewnot play a great deal to be honest the game seem pretty good i like the mechanic and the combat system big issue really be the wait time 10 minute between game be just not acceptable and i can much easily play another moba game that do not make me wait as long between match i can not blame the game for that its obviously a small playerbase but due to this it be kind of an endless loop no player long wait time less player longer wait time,pos
early access reviewthe late update of the game have turn this from okay to terrible before you have different tier in which you be out into match with and very rarely there would be someone from a low tier now everyone use the same base cube the addition of use multiple weapon on the same bot make this less of a tactical game but more of a let see how many different gun i can fit on a bot all freejam seem to care about be how much money they be get from the game the only update that i find useful be some balance change when they remove the cost to repair after a game and the crf it be ironic that freejam jam with the community as they never seem to listen to the community,neg

tl dra unique experience no other game do combine arm this well at this scale have a very steep learning curve but it be definitely worth it still an absolutely breathtaking game more than 5 year after release i implore everyone to at least try this game i owe some of my most amazing moment of gaming to ps2 contrary to what many people say this game be not remotely pay to win at least in infantry combat your start weapon be great any weapon you can buy be side grade they affect your playstyle but do not give you an advantage in every situation there be a point to be make in vehicle combat though as some arguably must have weapon have to be unlock such as rocket pod luckily though every weapon except for the fancy decorate one which have no benefit over the regular other than look nice can be unlock with cert this game free currency there be something here for everybody like tank oh we get tank alright like fly sure you want a bomber fighter or transport vehicle more of a hit n run type try the buggy or put a grenade launcher on your quadbike as for infanrty the light assault allow you to scale wall the infiltrator can cloak and snipe the heavy assault have heavy hit weapon and rocket launcher it be all here you will hear some people say there be no reason to play any other class than heavy assault but this be simply not true yes the heavy be capable of take and deal the most damage but this be pretty much all they can do if you learn to master the other class you will be just as much of a threat an infiltrator for example can sneak around the battle and start hit the enemy from behind unseen take advantage of your turret near a chokepoint as an engineer the possibility be endless however it will take you a lot of time to figure out what the good option be in any give situation many player however be willing to help do not be afraid to ask question about anything take note of what other be do and try it yourself if it be not work that be not your playstyle and you should switch,pos

early access reviewthis game be great once until the developer ruin it this be my opinion for 3 reason 1 the tech treerobocraft use to be so much fun when the tech tree be there it give the game a purpose something to aim for to unlock well gear since that us now go the game have no purpose it have become minecraft 2 where you can just build whatever you like 2 the tier systemall the original player would agree that robocraft be well with the tier system it make the game fair for everyone and make it so you could get match with robot the appropriate level to yours the tier system and the tech tree be what make the game great as you have to play game earn tech point unlock new gear and keep do this until you could get your robot to the next tier 3 gameplayin the respawn and overclocke update the gameplay change dramatically both negatively and positively it make it some once you be dead you be still in the game but this damage certain thing for me this update make the medic useless instead of the idea of the medic help fall team mate and stop team mate get eliminate they alter it so if you be damage you could just respawn i know they keep the normal gamemode but no one play it recently to help with the creation of this game become minecraft 2 they have make it so your robot no longer require a pilot seat this be stupid in so many way and now the rail cannon have become somewhat useless it use to be that if you headshotte a robot pilot they be instantly destroy and still be this mean that people who do not have pilot seat have a huge advantage overall robocraft have be completely destroy and make unenjoyable p s i use to play the game through the launcher not through steam so do not think i be just some noob with 8 9 hour,neg

do not let the free to play aspect fool you what you do not pay with your money you pay with your health use to be a great game now it be a pro fascist propaganda tool toxic community mostly us server untolerable disbalance in favor of fascist faction in tank battle so you be stuck grind for silver even tho grinding be already bad in the game excessive grinding in rank 5 and up even with premium pay overpriced content bias in game admin who block user for no other reason than to just respond into chat unless they be pro fascist us in which case even curse be allow and go unpunished i have see it happen a lot content milking ie you activate a booster only to be mismatch against much high opponent just so you can waste your booster without profit even if you pay real money for it once realistic balanced environment now make legendary tank look like cardboard box with turret limit coop which be at time severely restrict to pay content and force player to play arcade game mode to even participate while supresse realistic gaming in the game sb with limited cycle event install an agent client that start as a service while it be only understandable that gaijin may want to grow someday and have own store like origin and uplay this agent be at time aggressive and can not be stop it also conflict with security tool much more wrong with this game i will not even bother just stay away from it the only thing that be somewhat fun be simulator flight battle and that in particular if you play with friend everything else have turn into toxic pool of competitive wasteland alike of cod and siege spare yourself and your wallet do not make the same mistake and play something more meaningful if this game continue on this path it will die as war thunder within next 6 8 month,neg
probably the good ccg out there especially for player on a budget mechanically it be well than hearthstone and it be very generous to player in term of card and pack drop so you do not need to spend hundred of dollar to build a good deck like you do with magic also unlike mtg arena this actually have a good user interface it be a bit slow to start off with five campaign that unlock your five starter deck but from there on it be great first pvp win of the day net you a pack of twelve card one of which will be a rare or legendary and sometimes a promotional card if you miss these you can later craft them for slightly less of the in game resource than a rare between this progression reward and daily quest it be not hard to build up a sizable collection of card fairly quickly and without drop a single real world dollar pound etc,pos

tl dr game be pretty fun if you can get past the free to play mobile port design of it although it do have some glitch from a technical perspective this be a port from a mobile game i have play the mobile game before and want to try it on pc because the screenshot honestly look pretty good the problem with the mobile version for me be just the terrible ui design which really emphasise the free to play microtransaction pack design of the game the moment you enter you will be bombard with all sort of you just get free gem you just get free ticket there be a sale go on go and buy some pack this game have more visual and auditory cue than an actual casino i despise it when game turn into service platform and this be what make me deinstall the mobile version not only do the pc version carry over all of this nonsense but it also crash randomly the screen where you actually see the world the menu etc be limit to the center of your screen and the side of your screen will literally have the duel link logo slap onto them haphazardly so it be clear this be never intend for wide screen play this be the default and you can see how the design of the control be also intend for smartphone play it be all flash and effect and it simply do not suit me i would rather if it have a plain design and just focus on the actual game as far as the gameplay be concern from a collectible card game perspective you will likely enjoy it a lot it be yu gi oh after all and you can get plenty of thing to get you start for free by just play the game although it all become a whole lot easy if you be ready to purchase card pack just as you would do in real life it be not a bad game it be the design issue that put me off,neg

everything post below be completely base on my own personal opinion and experience when play the game positive unique view on the different god the style and voice pack voice pack 3rd person moba not a baaad community not great either pretty good graphic not bad music interesting chat system use voice guide chat example just type without hit enter to chat vvgg to say good game ras laugh to laugh do above but press vel negative bad matchmaking system a level 1 just start out get put against lvl 30 and if u be in a party prepare to always go against stupidly high lvls and high mmr player consistant launcher problem whether through their site or through steam and no realy fix for any of them smite tech people seem clueless when try to help with any technical problem and the community usually help then the tech just copy and paste community can be a tad salty and toxic tell them to gear down seem to help some hirez seem to not really care about their community personal opinion i know it say i only have 10 hour on this game but i have play it since open beta over all however i think you should get this game just do not try to go in and be serious about it because you will have a very stressful day assume i can ever get the game to work again i tend to play it again,pos
download the game 3 day ago and now i have 30 hour of playtime on neverwinter it be that addictive the game be great lot of people a good questing system etc many agree that this game be amazing but there be some con despite what the community and player tell you base on what i have find on my 30 hour of gameplay let me show you my pro con important note this game be not p2w like many say you can go along fine playing for free just steer clear of the pvp arena the p2w player will be there game be in english pro great questing system and trackfinder combat be great lot of people always online you will probably never go into an instance and find that you be the only one there lot of content amazing graphic for a free game can lower high at will engage can spend hour on this game and not get bored many dungeon can spend hour play with friend in a dungeon and have a great time there there be a bit of secret boss place etc you can find in a dungeon con you can only get 1 basic mount then you would have to either wait till an event come or buy it with zen astral diamonds zen be at a very low exchange rate lot of stuff in the game the ad and zen be overprice mod speak in a different language than english for all you englishmen the damn dropboxe get annoy you get the same thingo over and over again and you can not open it without zen summary the game great for first time rpg player to try and get a taste of thing and you could really have fun in this game but to achieve true potential of this game you would need to grab a few buck out of your wallet to really make your character stand a chance in those pvp arena note i hope you find this guide useful enjoy your stay in neverwinter,pos

early access reviewwhat seem like another minecraft clone quickly show how much of it be own beast it truly be do not get me wrong with its voxel base terrain and building mechanism it wear it be influence firmly on it be sleeve but creativerse have carve it be own brilliant niche in the survival creative genre it be extend building system wiring system advance craft adventure and multiplayer ease all put it a step above the big guy in the genre and it be character modelling music and light all go towards create a truly characterful and inviting game space it be free to play model be weight perfectly microtransaction be available for premium block but the core game be completely unhindered by any pay wall they have the balance perfect a fantastically fun characterful and in depth survival creative game not to be miss,pos
early access reviewspace piracy i download this game because i think i could be a space pirate hahahaturns out you could not well joke aside this be one nice game the graphic be smooth the control be pretty easy once you get the hang of it although i still could not do escape maneuver and get hit by a few laser the point defence system be great for intercept enemy missile and never forget to use it when you encounter an enemy because it could mean life and death level up from 1 to 3 be pretty quick too once you hit level 3 you can start play co op and pvp have not really try all the feature yet but it be a decent game for anyone who want to feel a fresh space fighting thing a ma jig sad thing be it be a bit long to find player for pvp dunno if it be me who play at a wrong time or because not many people have instal the game yet hopefully there be more people play because it be hard capture the basis on your own while tank 3 enemy,pos
the game be the good in its genre people need to understand the mentality of its gameplay you be not suppose to open and play it for hour its a side game a multi task game a coffee game to spend that 10 minute and look forward for the next day to send more dweller into the wasteland build more facility breed and expand its go to be slow its go to take time but it be worth it because this be your vault with your people some note for new player the game be free but extremely fair you can cheat some premium item without any repercussion i would personally recommend it this be a casual game as you do not need to worry too much if you make some mistake but it have great depth and interesting mechanic to research and improve your vault and make well decision with that be say it not without its flaw the managing of your dweller can become a huge chore later on the ui do not help since it be build for mobile but that be my single complain i wish they make some improvement there but i do not see that happen especially since its exactly the same game everywhere ios android bathesda pc client window 10 and steam version unfortunately for those wonder you can not auto sync your game with the mobile version even though all the platform share the same kind of save file that mean that the game do not support autosync but you can easily manually take your save file and use them in any other platform i play on different platform so i do not yet have a lot of time f to display here but steam have achievement so yay,pos

if you enjoy diablo 2 you will enjoy this if you love diablo 2 you will love this i think diablo 3 be fun but a little less difficult than this game path of exile really put you on the spot every time you go somewhere you make a mistake on this hostile island full of murderous creature and evil being and boom you die gggs alternative to end game content be pretty interesting too even though i have not reach that point yet and they encourage people to try new thing with their ever change seasonal event and race reward just for play them no pay to win and plenty of friendly people in game make for pretty happy player update to review i have since reach endgame content and by all that be e holy this game be amazing far better with friend too since most people like to do so heres a pro and con setup pro gameplay like i describe above the game feel ultimately rather similar to diablo in how it be play until you get into the real meat and potato of it somewhere usually around level 30 35 or so community the community be amazing sure we will mess with people and provide peanut gallery level commentary on everything hell one of my character be name cactus chucker for god sake but we also help out player who be legitimately just ask question or learn aspect of the game for the first time everyone start somewhere and not all of us have 800 hour not pay to win grind gear game have absolutely nothing functional that you can pay for aside from storage space consider that storage space do not affect your character in any way shape or form in how they be play how their damage be calculate or anything the game can not be classify as pay to win just pay to look dope as and have all the shiny thing stash away where they will never see the light of day co op you can play with friend it be free invite your friend and show them the glory of punch thing so hard they explode infernal blow facebreaker hardware limitation i run this game on an 8 year old hp laptop obviously that mean that it be not super hardware intensive make it easy to play with friend who be not as up to date on their tech con connection require yeah this be kind of annoying be online at all time make this kind of a hassle if there be thing happen like inclement weather or other thing like repair on hardware in your area not a huge con but still worth mention desync this one be mostly a new player problem and be easily fix by change your connection setting in the main menu note can not be do while in game must be do before select a character under input from predictive to lockstep basically change from game assume where you will be react from there to client tell game where you be game react from there save many death,pos

early access reviewat it be current state i would not recommend this game for anyone but free to play player with a lot of free time if you be a pay customer the legendary card which you can have 4 of in a deck be difficult to collect especially with less free time to play they tout guarantee 3 legendarie for every box 32 pack which be normally all you be go to get it be ridiculous in a game where you need 4 of say legendarie i have purchase quite a few box and rarely have i ever get anything more than that unless you be fine just play one deck for a long time it be an awful system also this game be similar to magic the gathering in it be mana land for resource which do not really translate well in a online card game when i can go 5 game in a row be mana starved play 25 power in a deck plus 4 x of seek power spell that let me find one be equally ridiculous i have play magic for 20 year and never have an issue like that in the physical game hell not even in the online version,neg
addictive and great to have on in the background be not a strain on on the computer neither also the feeling of progress when be afk or away at work school take out the grind dread if i have the money i would put into micro transaction i feel free to play this game be really well do only critism i have be a clean ui maybe have another tab for all the sale and other stuff instead of it in the side,pos
  swank animu simulator have you ever want to be a cliche shounen protagonist then this be the game for you this game be awesome well now it be as many of you can tell this game have receive a lot of flak after add the unbalanced charactersadd prompt my joke above and lu ciel no i do not randomly throw in a slash the character be 2 different people these character be able to once awaken keep an enemy in a combo for ever which break pvp cause the outrage so finally kog have respond by no not nerfe the new character but remake all the old one and the new one too but they be not out yet at the time i be write this so imma just assume that they be go to be balance this be addrese sorrynotsorry all of the problem in pvp even if it do completely over pve but who care about that anyways all in all this game be really fun and incredibly fun when play with friend i highly reccomend it and promise you that you will not be let down,pos
  positive amazing game what i have be look for a hunting game be map size smart ai sound bow crossbow rifle shotgun pistol and this game do just that the graphic do a great job aswell for make game hard to spot out negative but there be downside for this game such as you have to purchase alot of thing such as the weapon the clothing and hunting licence somtime the render distance be a little bit annoying soution they can improve this by buy membership for the licence and instead of weapon you have to purche with gun with earn ingame currency such as gms instead only of ems i think alot would agree that would be a well idea through do mission or tag enough game for gms maybe the score of the buck can calculate towards earn gms such as 100 score buck will earn you 10 gms i do not know it be my idea and still should be able to buy gun with real money for a quick shortcut but a progression system through buy gun would be good and not so many would complain also it would be good if there be a option to increase render distance because sit 150 meter away i can see game sit at a river bank and i zoom in there be tall grass there and when i zoom out there be none if you can get past through all that than this be a really good game and i be happy with buy membership and purchase a couple of weapon but it can be costly to some my score my total thought on the game 7 10 great simulator just need work on the gms system and render distance,pos
early access reviewthis game remind me of game i play online browser flashplayer base when i be 12 or so it be very fun and i think very amusing esspecially when you wait for fallout 4 or total war warhammer but i think 19 99 be far too much for this game get it on sale or so anyway it be well make and fun to play,pos
this game be not bad but hope you never need the help of a gm i be introduce a new player into the game we both be eject from the server at the same time we log back in she be stick in the terrain as in nothing but black around here we try stuck killme log in out nothing work we submit a ticket we wait we wait we wait we go find something else to do and we be auto log off we come back seven hour later she be still stuck so either we have to sit there and make sure we do not auto log off to get help that be not happen or seven hour later they still have no unstuck her that be a wonderful way to sell a game needless to say we be go to play a different game,neg

i young friend of mine beg me to install this so i give it a go it be terrible right from the start with the ear assault garbage music to the incredibly frustrating and unintuitive menu and character selection screen that make you want to turn the thing off immediately here be a little message for the developer if your player select some game mode for me it be tutorial and wish to exit that game mode you should let them do that typically this occur by press esc key to get to a menu in freestyle basketball you will not receive this courtesy if you decide you want out you be go to have to complete that tutorial i somehow know it be go to happen but this be by far the bad gaming experience i have have in year there be plenty of decent free to play game out there this be not one of them,neg
early access reviewfirst off i would like to say that this review be not suppose to be negitive it be suppose to be a reflection of my own experience with the game and how i thnk the game could improve before i continue i want to say that i have a very fun time play this game and i would most certainly recommend this game to anyone who have play smash before at either a competitive level or casual level because it be not only a very similar concept but it also feel very fresh and new with the addition of weapon that change your moveset completely this alone set it appart very far from smash while also keep the core of what make it fun which i think be very nice with all that be say here be some gameplay mechanic that i think should be add and why short hoppingreason it be really hard or sometimes even impossible to approach with an ariel with a lot of the time your option be to either dash attack or to jump wait a long time then use an ariel and that to me do not feel like enough option and personally i feel like add a short hop would give the player waaay more option in term of an ariel approach and ariel movement which i think could enhance gameplay greatly a walk speedreason maybe this be already a thing and if it be you can call me out for it but from what i can tell there be no walk speed which be very annoying when you be try to approach without use a dash attack or turn around for a strong attack but then again i be not sure how this would work for keyboard so idk you could add this if you want but it would not change that much it would just be nice fast fallingreason it feel very hard to get back down to the ground when you be up in the sky so add this would give people more option when want to get back to the stage and who know maybe people could add it to there combo game example be dash attack then short hop into forward air then fast fall into maybe a strong attack i personally think this would be very fun an up weak attack or in smash term an up tilt reason well i mean why not there be already a down tilt so why the heck would not there be an up tilt it also would give more option for against ariel approach which would be very nice it could give every one a well combo game as well neutral air and up air should have different move reason it feel wierd when you put in 2 different input and get the exact same thing as well as it could make moveset more diversesorry for this hugeatmatmatmatmatmwall of text 3,pos
early access reviewafter more then 130 hour i just can not be positive anymore dev have go complete silent no update lose player even emassarys be stop this game have some really nice gameplay but all the thing like dead server dupe hackingye there be a fly speed hack already only tweak ini file only thing they can do now imo be close the server and wipe and try again in 6 month its a shame i have high hope for this dev team but in the end its how do we make fast money if even the translation be do cheap you know something be up to all you people who think they should try it do not yetmaybe in 6 month who know if you be bored and money be not a problem buy the 30 usd one and nothing more will keep an eye out the next few week but i doubt something will change,neg
i really really want to love this game but i can not the concept graphic and scale be fantastic but overall the execution make it a mediocre fps the combat feel clunky and no matter the setting the weapon feedback just feel completely disconnected from the mouse input like it be build around controller with the mouse be an after thought i do not feel the technology be there for this to run as an fps require again no matter the setting use the frame just feel wrong and stutter further make the game feel clunky and disconnected in addition there appear to be significant de sync issue with cover be almost irrellevant as you may be behind cover on your end but on the other end you be not and continue to take fire when you should not the unlock system break the game in a f2p fps game it should be an unlock system that allow you to build class to your play style however this be an upgrade system that make you character better faster strong cause balance issue finally it go without say but you will need a team for this one it be brutal for the solo player and even with a public group you will find yourself be stomp by more coordinated team at the end of the day it be f2p so by all mean try it but i would strongly advise avoid spend any cash on it i do and i regret it,neg
early access review edit just as i say i will change the review to positive as soon as they add solo queue again i be glad that they listen to the community and do not take too long this game have so much potential and i be very excited to see how far can they take it definitely give it a try i can not wait to fully enjoy the game now thank to everyone who like this review everyone else who try to support the same idea and the awesome dev for listen to the feedback and actually do something about it and even leave a comment here keep up the great work the game be quite fun i do not give it a negative review because it be a bad game however i can not recommend it if you be a solo player not be able to queue solo be a dissapointment and before all the tryhard kid go but you can play duo or sqad and do not fill 2v1 be easy no just no i do not wanna play 2v1 and no i do not wanna play with random if you play with friend then totally go for it as i say the game be very fun but if you be like me and enjoy to sit back and chill by some solo then better wait until they add them i will change the review once they add solo but for now i just do not enjoy it as much completely ignore this gamemode should not be a thing,pos
360 hour on steam and thousand on the stand alone client back before there be tank the grind to unlock vehicle be reasonable the game feel progressive like you could still manage to unlock later tier such as iii and iv without go premium crew matter flesh out different plane be engage and fun one of these patch in the last year or two have bring the grind to an absolutely unbearable crawl this game have always be about grind but there be a balance between grind and progress which the dev have mess up when you strip away the progress reward mechanic that people endeavor for in game you be not create an environment of entertainment anymore you be waste their time and this should be carefully consider how many thousand of hour be you willing to waste i try premium for a few day just so i could dump all my rp into unlock the tiger never end up unlock it and the level of progression now with a premium account be the same as we have play this back in 2012 f2p so in conclusion there be really no point in playing and it be not that progression have be put behind a paywall hey support the dev they need money to develop guy it be be put behind a paywall and neuter to such an extent that you will literally grow old before accomplish much of anything beyond tii unless you pay for it do not waste your time or money these be the kind of model that ruin gaming make the game sell the whole thing not cut up into a million dlc and prosper as digital artist if your game be solid,neg
early access reviewan overuse concept with some welcome addition to that base formula that allow for an intriguing if not all too familiar experience the actual game itself be litter with bug which be to be expect with the nature of alpha build all in all the experience be enjoyable but still nothing special although the recently increase and already very rapid and active development that be base off of the feedback from the community be a welcome change of pace from a competitive shooter that be not see elsewhere and lead to hope for the future of this game as a whole overall i would give the game a 6 5 10 in it be current state,pos
early access reviewugh another one of these if you like battle royale well here be more of the same this be more of a cartoon stlye game with a class system no base building like fortnite power up before take on your enemy,pos
early access reviewin simple word good game but their server always under maintenance and it suck they do it for hour and hour it turn you off plus this game be not fair at all they should place strong player in strong side and weak player in weak side if you play as pilot you can not find server for it i think its total turn off,neg
early access reviewfor the three hour iv play this game it be really good and its free i find that so cool and yes they do need to nerf and buff a few gun like the starter pistol could do a little more damage but that could be just me bad with pistol but overall i find this game to be great,pos

this be a great game i highly recommend get this any one of the character that you can choose from have their own unique and interesting way in which you can choose to play the graphic for the various spell and effect that happen change with other effect that you can blend into the build that you want to aim for i would say that my favorite at the moment be a combination of wildstrike great multiple projectile volley support and elemental damage with attack support with the unique weapon that i have that believe have the 80 chance to cause bleed buff i do not remember what weapon it be honestly i make a new build around the link socket i also use the extra blood buff that i purchase from the store when i also buy the money organizer tab which i also highly recommend before you start lose hair over the stress you will go through try to figure out how to best organize your stuff just get the extra tab also get the other organizer tab once you get a few thing that you don t know what the heck they be do not sell them some stuff be rare that come up later also do not save up a whole bunch of useless stuff you be go to find so many combination of cool thing in the future once you get more into the game that you will eventually run into the problem of figure out where to put all of your unique item do not sell those that come into play later on too and you will wish that you have not anyway enjoy this game be a blast,pos
this be a really solid card game that take many idea of similar game and combine all the good part wile keep most of the bad stuff out that be say conscription the last nerf be neglagable for telvani conscription because of all the ramp in those color and why do you nerf ash berserker would recomend,pos

a totally addictive substitute for a certain other block base sandbox adventure the name of which elude me at present you start in a random location in a randomly select world from a short list of hand craft candidate that world be compose of thing all of which be make of block of equal size there be some exception such as creature and some object all of which be unique quirky and enjoyable it be very easy to find yourself overpowered in this game and so far the only way that the dev have slow down one journey to overpoweredness be by make you work through item tier by tier as oppose to just make the good stuff as soon as you find the good material i think the only time i have negative emotion about this game be when i be mentally expect something from that other game dammit its name be on the tip of my tongue but those moment be few and further between they be also sufficiently different that one can easily enjoy both without either feel redudant so i have reach the end of this review and still can not remember the name of the other game like this one just like that game however this one be essentially characterise by mining and or craft,pos

it be a pay to play game even though it say free to play you can only get a few gun without use real money overall if it be not pay to play i would give it a 7 10 i do not recommend this game unless you want to spend money on it,neg
it be a little more dicey than actual monopoly even old people with zero technical talent could play this game there be no trading but instead you can buy out other player property if you land on it building can be make right off the bat two house after the first pass you unlock a even big building if you land on a tier 3 building than you can upgrade to a hotel if you have excess cash,pos
some feature i like in this game be how the game can be play in an either independent or team dependent base way and or team base with unlock able weapon taunt cosmetic item among other thing though people joke about this game and how op some set up be or how meta some item be or how much their hat be worth hatfortress2 in the end of the day it be all up to how you play and if you have fun edit though the game be not as it be in its prime when it become f2p you can argue that it be dead as it have an active community and player base after the whole wave of overwatch kill tf2 i be confident to say that tf2 be very much alive and a game that i continue to and love to play,pos

the current state of bless be lack in many of it be content compare to the time give to develop price tag and relative success in other area in my opinion here the fact the game though pretty fun early on lack content for late game the game lack content especially when compare to with the jap version although update and content be be add it be just too slow and little the royal quest and gem fragment be not worth it compare to the effort need some of community be leave so that be go to leave a void for group and pvp for a new player be very unfriendly with a community of hardcore gamer who will never help instead of help newcommer they will do a 5 man dungeon with 2 3 ppl because most of the ppl leave be way way too overgeared but they want more because be nothing else to do i guess also big guild recrute ppl not to help them but to find player to boost guild point terrible community if you be look to get this game hold off until the price come down to 10 or less i hope for the people that do spend a lot of money steam will give a refund not only to the stream but to all for such a blunder but i be not hold my breath,neg

multiplayer contain alot of troll with no admin to get arid of them and i be a big fan of multiplayer when it come to online game but for this game you get at least a couple trolls here and there in a server they often like to ram you off the track or use their car to block part of the track driver like me would rather roleplay and play the game the professional way it only take one troll to ruin the server gameplay and there be no body to take care of the issue if troll be not such a big problem i would recommend this game but i do not just about ready to uninstall this game if multiplayer do not get any well,neg
i be just straight do with this game totally do here be the list why1 hacker even though the forum will deny up and down that they have see a hacker in game for nigh 2 year or so they exist i would almost bet the denier be hacker when someone can take a machine gun one that should have the bad recoil and accurracy at distance and fire at a full speed move jeep and 1 shot the full health gunner with heavy set medal at gold with a head shoot from clearly away from easy sight the likelyhood of that just be a really skilled player be slim to none its totally bs 2 dev bias the developer have a clear bias for certain faction regularly when a update come out its for the german or soviet faction never the allied go ahead take a look find the last time they announce any kind of weapon or vechicle update highlight something for the allied faction if you find it i would bet its all the way back in early day of production and with that bias come 3 unbalanced faction you will regularly hear any allied player complain about be 1 shoot with a gewer in the chest and yet it be 100 impossible for any allied gun to return that favor the amount of pure damage gun outside of the allied faction can deal be unbelivable its rediculous and make the game completly impossible hell you can not even get a decent scope for a sniper vehicle all have this same problem ally armor be weak in comparison last i check that s not how the war go this use to not be as much of a problem a long while back when you could buy the weapon the enemy faction have as your start weapon well they take that right the fk out now there be just a wall of bullet you well hope you can get around 4 dev just do not care the dev be just cold and uncaring i have an issue where they do a big update and it wipe out all of my xp for my sniping gun i make a support ticket i think i wait 3 month till i actually hear something back by then i have uninstalle the game the dev response oh yeah we will fix that in a rolling patch later heres a camo skin for your trouble oh and the only unlock it i still have to buy it with in game money this game should be rip from steam just look at the mixed review even hardcore vet of this game be just do with the nonsense do not waste your life on this soon to be wash up studio and their cut rate bias game,neg
i would like to dedicate this review to my friend who unfortunately pass away in early september he love this game and would have recommend it hundred of time over if he have that ability although i do not have as many hour on it as he do i would like to say it be fun back in 2015 and be still an alright game in 2018 even if many of the mechanic have change in the past few year,pos
early access reviewi actually like this game its not bad to its core it just have alot of issue that need to bet deal with the server need ping counter the connection on every ing server be horrible this be the only game where have a bad connection help you win the weapon seem horribly unbalanced or maybe that s me just get kill and have to wait 5 second for the lag to catch up i just can not play it the gun play be great but without a solid connection and horrible balance its just hide under some,neg
early access reviewthe good card game i have ever play i recommend for anyone that be into card game it be free pro very free to play friendly ability to create your own deck with relative easecon most people do not create their own deck basically the only deck you see be rakano plate and armory and most deck can not even compete with them occasionally one can be trigger because of luck,pos

a simple clean take on the popular game monopoly the game be very nice game to play with friend and online player to relax and to play for the fun its very easy to get the game and play without any complication gameplay wise the actual game itself look as say earlier very clean and you can understand everything on the board without hesitation my only complaint for say be the fact that the in game back round be quite bland and i wish there be a similar animated back round like the one in the main menu with the float square come from the corner or something similar to that style after play this game multiple time if u want to just chill with your friend and family for free this be the game for you star review 4 5 5,pos

can not say much about the base free to play game since i really have not play it just a single race but the dtm experience dlc be a must buy get on sale at the humble store for 6 24 this be one of the most realistic racing sim i have play the sound be incredible update i really can not recommend this game base soley on the cash grab that it be even during sector 3s summer sale the addon pack be quite over price sector 3 really nickel and dime you for every little tiny aspect of this game during the summer sale if you be to buy everything on sale it would have cost over 100 i buy assetto corsa with dlc include for less than 30 i buy project car for 35 and the dlc be dirt cheap if you have a wallet that be fat full of cash then go ahead and buy everything sector 3 want you to buy afterall it be a great sim to race in but if you value your dollar look to a cheap alternative update 2 i buy the premium pack from sector3 which get you everything they currently offer for r3e at that particular moment it set me back about 58 anything release in the future will cost extra,pos

path of exile be by far the most riveting and intriguing game i have ever play through the variation of character selection and weapon armor type it be just absolutely superior to all other game through my career of work for riot game i have earn the opportunity to play and help design many variation of video game i truly believe that no other game compare to this one path of exile be a game that you will not soon forget and will not easily get bored of path of exile lead you to many hour of action pack game play from the start of the game you be immediately throw into action as you wash up on the shore and you find that everyone be dead around and you be surround by flesh eat zombie as well as many other creature you have to fight your way through the unforgiving world as you collect new weapon armor stone wand and many other achievable item i believe that this be the good action rpg i have ever play,pos
early access reviewi like this game it be fun i like the art style and i do like the simplicity it be addict have not spend a dime and have not feel i need too though i will probably throw them a few buck for the work it be beat so expect bug but nothing a relog will not fix the ui be get change as well as most other thing i have issue with when ti come to the pc version i hope it get popular the community be friendly and helpful when it come to mob and quest and the mob can be tough which i like instead of pushover like in some mmo,pos
early access reviewthis game have so much do right eliminate a lot of the rng hstone card bring yet fast play as hstone provide and extra depth that mtg element bring and yet they fail to improve on the broken land mechanic of mtg its one thing to win or loose a game because you be draw badly or well yet to be completely eliminate from the match because 7 land come up in a row i do not know mtg be amazing but after all these year you can not tell me someone can not come up with something well because its insanely archaic i have build deck explicitly on empow mechanic and yet there be enough stun removal so that if you be only draw land you be dead in the water it just seem to happen to often other than that the game be incredibly free to play and have do so much so well but the sigil land mechanic have not evolve at all in 25 year i still think this game be actually great but dayum the land draw be simply horrible and should be a side effect board,pos
a terribly fun addicting and satisfying game to play the graphic outstanding the landscape even better when it come to shooter ps2 be by far the winner of all of them its massively multiplayer persistant world make it so that whenever you login there be always some action the problem with this be that i find it difficult to know when to stop i find myself in a biolab the whole hex be approx size of a bf3 map when in ps2 it be just 1 hex out of the many of them find on one map inside the biolab about 5x the size of a typical cod map this be not your ordinary shooter in just one of the many teleporter room in the biolab there be at least 40 people all try to get out while another 40 people in one of the other faction be stop you that be just one room span across all of the other room other platoon be try to get in this be just 1 bioloab there be many more of these all of which be live meaning no session no matchmaking it be one constant never end battle i be not one to drop money on f2p game but the sheer amount of work and dedication go into this game be totally worth my time and my wallet the one thing it lack though due to it be persistant nature be that end game feeling slowly soe have add more content to compensate such as the alert system where there be a global mission for your faction to complete like capture and hold 9 biolabs capture planet etc overall the game be 9 10 visually stunning gameplay be immense the free to play model in my opinion could be replace with a buy to play model but that be my opinion utterly amazing,pos
if you be a hardcore flight simmer then this be your stop the game feature the most realistic flight model you will ever find in any commercial flight simulator it be a true joy to fly any aircraft in this flight sim however those realism also come at a price the game be very complex and casual audience will find it not very accessible for them the learning curve be very steep so if you be just look for some casual flight sim this be not for you this game be for a hardcore simmer only,pos
i love this game i play it for year but i try to get back into it and bring a buddy of mine as well and realize you have to spend with a discount 745 dollar to unlock all of the content within the game to only raise even high when the new aircraft such as the f18 come out as well this be ridiculous it be unbecoming it be near criminal and disgusting i will not be get my friend involve in this game again 3edit 7 18 2018 if you buy an aircraft on steam you can not use it on standalone standalone update at different rate than steam at time so if you buy the plan on steam and play on a server you can not use that plane on standalone you have to wait 2 day to a week until it be update and you can play on your normal server again,neg

a game where 50 win chance be asure if you manage to go over 50 win then the enemy will get card that be situational against you also the pick engine make sure you get put against someone that have a deck to counter yours so he can get those card,neg
its an alright game keep in mind this be very pay to win if someone want they can send a bfg before they be even suppose to be able to send one and that s gg for you 90 percent of the time even if you have a well eco and more tower upgrade also in card battle someone can buy card that be very op its also extremely pay to boost you can literally buy anything someone spend countless hour try to get and upgrade be absolutely a neccessity and they be also buyable there be also many severe imballance for instance a fully upgrade tack shooter that shoot fire be way more powerful than a fully upgrade spike tower though even after the ptw system its still very fun it get bore fast though when you see someone send a bfg when you can not even send one yourself yet or when someone fully upgrade their tack tower and that s pretty much stop everything you throw at them when you have 9 tower fully maxe out to just their 3 with only 1 fully maxe,pos
very good game tutorial be very fun and interactive have not get past level 15 but i would like it if the tutorial tell you that you have to complete the first quest under the temple in order to play with friend,pos

early access reviewthis game use to be awesome and i be realy good at it have have alot of fun and play since it start but now after this new update will probobly never touch it again the dev have completly ruin it its now 90 pay to win the new crate thing u only get the good stuff in the crate if u have premium u buy premium to get more ingame money at the end of each battle that s go now also the premium keep run while ur offline that have always be a flaw but we have live with it now there be no ingame money u get crate base on ur score in each battle the item in them have to be recycle to get robit which be the component to make new item seem simple enough but u get 1 10 if that of the value of the item its impossible to get anywhere maybe after a month of play 12 hrs straight u may get half a robot build if ur lucky to the dev good job u ruin the best free to play game by be greedy u suck they care nothing about the fan base and nothing about the game all they want be ur money i say we boycott the game until they fix theiran remove this update,neg

i have never play a game as much as i play smite since mid to late season 2 i have have the wonderful oppurtunity to play smite as my first moba ever all the iteam ability and skilled player be very intimidating at first but the growth through the game be truly an amazing feel many people hate that smite have change so much but personally i be thrill with every change they make because the beauty of this game be how power of item and god be always shift and change allow new play style and way of stratgey this game have truly shape me on a realistic level as me and my friend have bond over it if you be think of try this game you must i personally believe there be a bit of a learning curve but once you find your perfect character and get your first victory then positive kd then penta and all the way to place in rank you will hopefully find as much enjoyment as i have i will continue to play this game for a very long time and will proudly declare smite to be my favorite game,pos
the game have such an up down style of competence so i would rate somewhere in the middle but as there be only two option i be go to choose no it can be immensely fun and if make by any company rather than gaijin it could be a very good game but with the direction they be head i be not get a fuzzy warm feeling on the good side it can be amazing fun with three different game style with vary realism and ton of different ww2 aircraft to choose from after a few hundred hour however the downside of the game really show the balancing in wt be usually questionable to downright bad especially at hig tier where german and japanese ww2 prop see postwar american jet russian bias no but definitely some extensive support for the russians from dev where we get another yak to add to the pile of 20 no option to opt out of gamemode like the new and awful air domination which be one big cluster you do not want to be a part of also odd alternate history match that really should be able to be deselecte this review be just for the airplane by the way ground force be so terrible at the moment i do not even want to mention it,neg
early access reviewabsolutely fun game i be check for a few game that be free to play and this one i keep play till 5 30 in the morning for 9 hour straight you can play it either in single player or pvp and sp be a lot of fun the graphic be fantastic just like in hearthstone and they have alot of element from magic the gathering without the complete complexity or add the extra chore from it when you versus other people the wait time be only a few second so there be a heap of people play right now i can not be bother write a review so try it out they be very generous at the moment so get in and get all your free stuff and play against the ai or other player and rake it all in before they change it where they be less generous,pos

early access reviewi be really look forward to play the game but sadly it just do not deliver i understand this game be in early access and thing may change but honestly this be still not acceptable get into the game be very frustrating and many time you get stick at the entry screen even when you get into the game you crash or freeze a lot everytime you open inventory char skill etc you get a short screen freeze even with very high end desktop its hard to maintain acceptable fps value the game do not fix any preformance issue it have with previous version and it be very noticable furthermore the ui be complete dog the skill combo system also have small delay between skill which make it hard to like hopefully thing change but for now keep your money and do not waste it,neg
early access reviewalthough i have not play online yet i will play it as soon as i can connect to the server this be not their fault but be mine the game without any powerup would seem like a smash clone but alas even the moveset be different the item in this be all unique exept for that super annoying mine that somehow hit me everytime the cpu in this be smart with 0 bug from what i have see so far this reveiw be the good i could say i be not to good at write all in all i highly recomend this game i probaly will buy the full game when it come out depend on what be add and how often update be push,pos
early access reviewlisten up this game be honestly one of the good battle royale game i have ever play in my eye the mechanic and flow of the game be everything pubg should have be smooth fire fight que time be amazing map be perfect size for a full lobby fun customization my only downside to this game be for them just to fix some minor hit reg and as well as add a flip shoulder function cause i tell you what only be able to look over my right shoulder have lose me many gunfight but i know they will keep this game fun and entertaining final verdict 8 8 10,pos
early access reviewive hear it explain as world of tank but in space and that be a lot closewr to the truth than you may think v difficult learning curve but once you have get tyhe basic of it and get over your first stumble step its a good soldi game also have a progression sysrtem for each space ship comapny proberbly encourgee you to diversify into usue diffrent ship so the replayability be quite good would play very much like tf2 join a server or group up some matesa and beat he snot out of each other speaking of server keep the player cap for each server at ten fifve player a team be highly effective re in much low waiting time than usual would much recomend i like this game ity also look pretty too,pos

early access reviewthe most recent expansion have make make budget deck next to impossible you can still climb and reach master as a new player but expect to be beat up by player with much well collection regularly aggro be dead and the dev seem to be fine with let it die any time a combo deck become usable it get nerfe to oblivion midrange seem to be the playstyle that the dev push the most but now it take 16 copy of legendarie to build a competitive deck control be probably the good thing this game have to offer especially with the new merchant but you should still expect to need at least 8 legendarie to make a competitive deck in short this game be no longer a well ftp game than other ftp card game and the meta be heavily skewed toward slow match if you have to play a mtg style game its still well than mtg arena and mtgo,neg

for player new to yugioh and want to learn i do not recommend take this game too seriously as for the duelist who know what they be do who have play stuff like dragon ruler hand artifact traptrixes teleport dark armed dragon scapegoat metamorphosis thousand eye restrict lock whatever deck you name it anything from the actual game really those guy who know what i be talk about i do not think they be go to take this game seriously either my advice be forget synchro forget xyz forget pendulum forget deckbuilding and forget yugioh because this be not the yugioh you knowthis game get good review because of nostalgia and voice and kaiba meme i admit i too pick this up at first for the nostalgia and meme and while i appreciate that the fact of the matter be the gameplay in term of the logistic and card leave much to be desire i be kaiba and i start the game with a random deck that do nothing let us examine one of the most powerful gasp card in this deck name blue eyed silver zombie a normal monster with 900atk 700def play in 3 copy in the deck as of this moment i be have a seizure on the floor bawl my brain out at this monster titanic 900 attack stat to express my completely unbiased sincere evaluation of this card in all honesty i impart the follow word this card suck ball i be sorry but kaiba you will never be the next king of game with your fourth rate deckbuilding skill and fifth rate card do yourself a favor toss it in the chiller where it belong next to your frog the jam and mushroom man 2 it be to my understanding that a deck can only contain up to 3 copy of the same card why be it that these box have 8 9 10 of the same card in them not to mention they be all really bad in fact 90 of all the card there be either useless or will have no immediate use in your deck go through all the box see what card be in them be an exercise in cringe since the only ok card i may consider use be find in quantity of 1x and 2x mixed with all these 8x 9x and 10x card i be only go to throw away i can open a dozen pack right now and the good card in my deck will still be blue eyed silver zombie even some of the rarer card be not even good mirage knight be super rare in this game i bet there be go to be some guy who rip open who know how many pack for that sacred phoenix of nepthys but wind up get mirage knight instead and then kill themselves the next day i figure the good thing to do since everything sell be so bad be to not buy anything at all yo this crappy p2w mobile game be make big buck off you guy while half the card in this game include the one consider good can be physically buy for less than 50 cent at a real world store where real card be be sell like in the physical universe these player know that right save life you can get a super rare sacred phoenix of nepthys for 49 cent online in all seriousness it be just a bit bizarre to imagine people shell out in this game when you can hit up an online store and buy single or get a real deck in both a literal and figurative sense to those that be new to yugioh and want to learn the yugioh trading card game i would only suggest use this as a tool and only as a tool just to learn the rope and get the basic down do understand that this game do not have all the card and deck you see in this game be not what people be play out there in the real yugioh tcg,neg

although i frequently ask myself why in the world be i play this this be a strangely addictive time waster it be get a lot of variety as far as idle clicker type game go so if you like that sort of thing you will probably enjoy this one,pos
early access reviewthis game use to be awesome with progression level up and unlock new part it be no long that at all its even more of a grindfest that it be before it use to be about skill and how you build your robot would mean if you could do good or not in a match this game no longer take any skill at all its all about luck with what you can get out of a crate at the end of the match its no longer the game it use to be and be head in the wrong direction its hardcore pay to winedit after try the game again after awhiile it have go even more to a pay to play game than i could have ever imagine the game be absolute crap now the thing that i think they ruin the most be remove the pilot chair ill wait a few more month and if it keep go in the direction it be go now ill be do with the game forever its no longer fun at all to me,neg
good a 10 simulator as real pilot tell us today i believe him its really the good simulator but hard to learn too that s why its a good warplane simulator but there be minus too tank can drive trough the building for example in real world building collapse or something but not here but off course its a plane simulator first not a tank simulator,pos
grindy like really grindy p2w and have stale combat ability to make it more interesting early game but easy to get all of the ability for a class like 1hr no joke extremely luck base with constant 1 shot in serious late game content even with really good gear i have to say get a good drop feel gooood but it be instantly scratch out because it be p2w at least the game be free somewhat if you be able to look past that then play it but i would not recommend it,neg
early access reviewgame have real promise do it need work sure it be alpha what amaze me be i play on a low end laptop and it work and do not look half bad not great obviously but very playable really hope they keep up the good work and they do not try and bleed the player base dry from what i have see though i do not think they will try to pull any bull on everybody would i recomend someone get into early access yes absolutely need more people play edit really need a system in place to discourge people from disconnect from a game i know that will be some time off if it do happen and i also know that not all disconect be not player quit because the game be not go the way they think it should try to be nice but something will need to be do eventually,pos

early access reviewi have a chance to play robocraft a lot earlier on and it be a good title now to use a strangely appropriate vehicle metaphor it be pretty much a mess of part very little of the game really fit together every other month freejam add a new part or rebalance the old one with the effect of make one particular build empirically well than all the other notable sufferer be fix wing aircraft which be render totally obsolete by the nearly as fast tough more versatile cheap and nasty helicopter blade these be balance issue which be never likely to be fix either see as freejams chief concern of late seem to be the eradication of any challenge to the vehicle construction anything go these day personally i can live without see movie character romp around in my battlefield i come to fight a war not minion and sadly it be infest with gamebreaking bug range from one glitch which switch your robot collision detection off allow it to phase through the ground all the way to the one which simply overload your ram and crash the game at the end of every round i wish i could recommend it but i can not robocraft just be not very good at be robocraft any more,neg
suck to give this review you can only see like a 3rd of the screen irritating be not even the right word there be such a long delay between all the event and phase etc also i can not seem to summon more than 3 monster at a time i select the option i have play the card game but still force to do tutorial click on a card display the description on the card in a block and on a popup why show it 3 time overall not good also the move background annoy me,neg
early access reviewthey apparently remove it but eternal have spyware call red shell on it that track your activity outside the game i would not trust them it be likely they will integrate it back in because they be very defensive about use it,neg
great free game on the market except when i get it and click play the register screen appear which be normal but when i click register there be suppose to be a list code to type in but there be not also when i download the game on the official website it work fine so then i try to log in use the steam version and the register screen appear but where the log in button be suppose be all it show be a loading circle what the poop but that carp only happen to me so it be still a great game and i highly recommend it btw press ctrl when the top right circle thingy be full to awaken,pos

i start play the game and all be fine until i get into the high game where germany have way well weaponry and almost always win so when you see that you be against the germans you just give up because no matter how hard you try you get destroy and spawn camp by the germans,neg
early access reviewthe game be fun at first but when you reach rank 3 the game be suddenly like world of tank you meet six tank on a small capture the flag map if they be go to have tank be skirmish they should change to max one or to on each team its destroy the filling of a fight they should step down with the vehicle and play on the infantry instead if this change happend then i would want to play the game more,neg
early access reviewmap look stunning graphic be nice but not changeable before the game start you litteraly need to be in the game find a safe spot to be able to check your graphic setting unable to connect to the server also keep say connection lose no matter what i do vpn or not this game have potential but have the bad server i have ever see they take pugb and make it bad currently if the connectivity be not fix i rate it 0 10 because of how un playable it be the frustration of be disconnect during a game or when launch a game sound and fx 8 10environment 9 10fun 7 10servers 0 10,neg

i love this game so much it keep me want to play more and more and it be simple but also complex i definitely think that there be a group of people that will enjoy this game and a group of people that will not for those people that will this game really take you to the edge with farming but the reward not only feel amazing when they be get but they pay off until the very end of the game i have really amazing thing to say about this game and without the help of a really good friend of mine i would not have find the last almost 400 hour of fun and happiness it definitely releave stress and be a good way to cooldown when stressed or just want to deal damage to thing,pos
well i use to play fallout shelter on my phone but all it end up be be one deathclaw attack after another so i delete the game so i decide to try the pc version and once again once you have a population of 70 everytime you log in it be a deathclaw attack follow by a raider attack follow by a mutant attack all right after log in it have happen 3 time in a row after log in and you spend the next 30 minute try to get the vault back in order each time it also make no difference what level your vault door be they just walk right through it so that be a waste of cap to even upgrade it the pc version will now get delete since it be not any fun try to build up a vault if all you do be rebuild revive or repopulate after every log in,neg
early access reviewgood game with alot of potential dev be work incredibly hard and quick to provide update ton of people jump on the hate wagon for launch issue which 95 of them have be resolve,pos
if i have to describe this game in a single word it would be fun team fortress 2 be a beautiful combination of sarcasm weird humor dynamic gameplay and comix like graphic and it work together just great the game offer several gamemode from standard one like ctf and control point to some unique one like payload a team have to push a cart from a to b i have have so much fun with this game i could not even decribe it it be amazing this be the only game where you can hide as an invisible spy under a box behind an enemy sniper while provoke him with shout annoying thing like that your knife will soon be in his back while he be try hard to focus on aim this be the only game where you can start play with a duck in a small pool in the middle of battlefield this be the only game where you can high five with an enemy while your teammate be die around after 1300 hour i be still not bored at all sure it look like a simple game for kid but tf2 be a unique team base first person shooter full or irony fun and sarcasm the community be very friendly you can meet a lot of very nice people there system info performance report platform linux operating system arch linux x64 desktop environment gnome shell 3 26 api opengl cpu gpu ram i5 7300hq gtx 1050 ti 12 gb setting 1080p maximum 2x msaa gpu driver proprietary 390 25 fps 100 270 technical side number of crash in stable version 0 available apis opengl multiplayer cross platform linux mac windows linux version rating perfect controller support excellent test with an xbox 360 wireless controller xpad linux build in kernel module any issue fullscreen performance crash 1300 hour never have a single problem port by valve,pos

very educational and fun if you be interested in the inner working of firearm gun be very detailed lot and lot of grind or real money necessary to unlock weapon but this should not come as a surprise these day,pos
early access reviewreally love the game but at the moment it be the event be really rig the dungeon bug out often and the low drop rate make it really hard to farm for the outfit so at the moment i will not recommend until they fix it,neg

so this game be awesome i have be play this more than any of my game it be like minecraft but for me be way look than minecraft i so far do not dislike anything but thing will be fix since i have be experience i like that you can glide use teleporter explore a big map have or play with many many people and can be for select people you want to play with i really like the idea that you can claim your own land from 1st claim i make it but the thing be you can keep go with claim and before reach out to less than 10 claim somewhere there you have to pay coin a currency in game but it be worth it because you really do not need 200 claim to build thing i like the fact you can build underground and not sure how long can you keep go and same with sky how long can you reach i like the fact that you can build with your friend get 10 claim your friend get 10 claim well now you could say you both have 20 claim if so i like that i can build 2 claim building and have someone do the other half in 2 claim i beleive there be so much to this game i really like the block item etc i like the biome and really like the creature,pos

this game use to be amazing i play most of my time on xbox one and i still think its a brilliant game but my review be base on how it be now and not the fun i have have in the past effectivly all the content before you hit a platau be to get you hooked in the story be pretty unimaganitive its all about well loot as be all mmo really once you cap you have weekly and dungeon the real campaign but to really get anywhere in this game its hugly pay to win want a decent mount above 80 speed how about 10 pound minimum spend how about a new decent companion yep 10 pound minimum spend expansion for the game how about 40 pound and there s a few i buy the dragon expansion a mount a companion and a few other thing and realise even then i be nowhere i end up spend 80 pound to hit another platau and before i could even get to where most of my clan where the game would have expect me to pay 200 500 pound the game be infact verryyy expencive and it try to hook you in with the first buy then you think ohh i can not go back now just no its a game with no real replayability unless your willing to spend a fortune you can not even make that much in game money that yes be transferable to real money to buy stuff but untill you have spend to much the more you spend the more you make very very pay to play if you want a game you can keep play without have to spend more and more money then i would not recomend this game at all as my old mate admiral ackbar say its a trap,neg
early access reviewthe overall gameplay be enyjoyable and the quirky cooking theme be unique despite my former statement this game be very unfair and dull for the majority of the game allow me to explain to preface this be only from my experience if you want to play give it a try i understand the fact that battle royale have rng luck play a roll in your success in cuisine royale case though i feel like it be too random 7 out of 10 game i spawn out in the middle of nowhere with nothing around me except for one tiny cottage with a random ammo clip and a scope other game i will spawn in a decent location and i will end up loot 6 house and leave the area with a c96 pistol with 8 bullet and a pot on my head the game dull for the most part due to the fact that for 90 of the atmatmatmatming game you do not engage with anyone and do not even get me start on the gun play the accuracy of weapon in this game be atrocious largley due to bullet bloom i do not understand why some developer add bloom as a game mechanic but it be atmatmatmatmatmatmatmatm it destroy the majority of skill that go into aim your weapon and it make fire fight for the majority of the time down to luck due to this bloom you tend to use a magazine of ammo on one person in most weapon with the exeption of the mg 42 and the ppsh and a few other which lead to tough late game when you be lucky enough to have regular engagement in the game in my opinion it reward hiding instead of engage the weapon damage seem inconsistant as well some time i will put 15 bullet into someone and they will not drop and i will end up lose the engagment 0ther time i will completely rip open the guy in like 3 bullet i realize that there be most likely hit multiplier but nobody should need to be hit 15 consecutive time to die it be glitchy as well i be play duo with a friend and we be go to win the game but instead the game decide to clip him into the military fort that he be stand on when he go prone ontop of it ultimitely trap him and kill him this game have a lot of potential i know it be in early access i will keep play and i will re review this game if the developer fix issue and be proactive in the community look forward the accessory mechanic be a very good addition and make the game unique compare to other battle royales darkflow studio even though this be an april fool joke to begin with if you support this game and innovate upon this idea you could make something really fun and it could be extremely popular optimistic for the future i still recommend this game since it be fun but it be break in a lot of aspect i want to address them while give my take on this game and thought for the future,pos

one of the good flight sim in the market great graphic level of detail and the flight model range from simple for beginner to almost pinpoint accuracy to the real life counterpart with complex system and procedure for the study level simmer yet all of the aircraft be approachable for anyone with the ability to search for a youtube tutorial note that if you want a true experience of the sim you will have to invest in an aircraft or two the price be high but the amount of detail and the aircraft accuracy to real life make it worth the price tag especially if there be a sale find an aircraft you think you may like make the investment and do whatever you want in the sim singleplayer campaign dogfight online against other free flight just find a way to make it fun for yourself,pos

this game be shallow and un balance the first hour of play seem fine you get some easy win against player who have no idea how to play the game then the balance change and you only face people who have pay to unlock all tower the bad part about this aspect be that when you pay to unlock these tower you completely bypass the level system so two player can both be 100 dart and one player can have simply pay for every lvl 3 and 4 tower so basically at a certain point its impossible to win without pay for the tower so a first time player have to look forward to get pull into the experience and then lose every single match bar none for 30 match in a row this game be a shallow pay to win failure i have 100 complete bloonstd 4 and 5 and i can not stand this game this game only exist for micro transaction the game itself be a hollow shell to make you pretend you be actually accomplish something against other player when in reality this be a cesspool of kid with their parent credit card effortlessly win against free player pay to win or stop play that be the good summary of bloon battle i can give,neg

aparently the game be make by the same team that make diablo2 which be not the one that make diablo3 it really be d2s sucessor the gameplay be pretty similar with the single big diference be the character customization you can make literally anything you want from a necromancer templar to a dual wielder deal elemental damage since i be such a big fan of d2 back in the day i have to try this game if you do not want to read all of it skip to the end you have several class to play the one you pick basically set where you start on the passive skill tree at the end of chapter 3 you unlock the scion class which be the most versatile and can easy become whatever you want when you level up you get point you can use on the passive skill tree to make your character strong the passive skill tree be truly gigantic hence the huge variety of choice when build your char you also get gem that you slot into your item each gem have a skill and the gem level up as you do you can connect gem for extra effect as there be many support gem that do not do anything for themselves but enhance other gem with damage skill duration blind enemy extra effect like make melee single target skill splash for target around etc there be 3 type of gem and gem slot red green and blue red be typically the brute one and therefore require strength the green require dexterity and the blue inteligence this gem system be very versatile just like the passive skill tree the game currently have 4 chapter while chapter 1 and 2 be kinda easy chapter 3 get hard and final boss on chapter 4 be pretty damn hard so let sum it up pro easy to play highly character customization want to shoot a cone of fireball as wide as the screen that also deal lighting and cold damage want to have an army of zombie spirit and totem miss your whirlwhind d2 barbarian and want it back but now deal elemental damage yes please madam free to play area change so each time you replay each area the map be different con visual perk like wing and stuff be pay like guild chest or extra chest tab but you start with 4 so that be hardly an issue take a while to learn and master the gem system but once you get roll you can make truly amazing thing get kinda boring after a while so just start another class lol,pos
great spiritual successor to diablo 1 and 2 what be not to like it be free old school 2 5d graphic lot of customization option ability to play with friend and a much longer storyline the diablo 3 unlike most game f2p which make money to help people power their character up pay 2 win grind gear game sell character visualization enhancement overall it be a great way to strengthen that right pointer finger click clickity click,pos

while writte this review i have over 1000 hour play several character with max lvl and finish all end game content the good pretty good and enjoyable combat system pretty much the reason i still play it decent graphic option for free 2 play player to get almost everything from the real cash shop though it be hard and time consume decent event and promotion once in a while include pvp event hourly activity event system this be one of the good thing which can happen to mmo it pretty much help to reduce queue time and give some bonus reward to the player the bad this game have few heavy curreny exploit which totaly ruin the econmy lot of the exploit currency be not remove and impact this game to this day many exploiter be not ban and run in good in slot item without any penalty real money mean very little unless you can spend several thousand of on a game basically if you would want to get full bis gear you would need like 2k of real bug take month to get fix if they even bother to fix them in the first place lot of overpowered item which come from lockbox sadly this game be not live on cosmetic stuff like dota 2 several end game instance be often nearly unplayable due to server lag very poor class balance extremely poor pvp balance for example you can move your good in slot enchant from your high lvl character to a totaly low lvl character and use it in pvp because it have no min lvl require i think i do not have to explain how much impact it have even at max lvl pvp there be insane gear gap between player refile system pretty much pay to win feature it make all your gear useless so you have to spend lot of real to get nearly bis or bis gear or pray to get lucky with some extremely rare drop this game do very little to reduce the gap between old and new player if this do not change in near future it will be the reason why this game die,neg

this be a very good change of gameplay compare to league which go back to that game feel too easy and rather dull in gameplay compare to the dynamic action in smite here be beginner god you should try that i find too easy to use adc cupid apollo neith artemis mid posidon kukulkan anubis scylla vulcanjungle fenrir loki great for split push thor mercury basicly the hecarim of smite support athena sobek ymir change ares if enemy buy purification bead buy cooldown reduction tanky item solo pretty much any god can solo easily in smite even support like sobek ares yimir even the adcs can go solo lane since most of them be equip with mobility or with good crowd control attack smite be a third person moba with the same objective as dota and lol 3 lane 2 jungle 2 jungle boss tower inhibitors pheonix titans nexus i have be play this for over a year now and personally i find the gameplay control to be alot more fun and it have its own unique stragety to it for example your map radar only show near sight of enemy object but only you can see what s directly in front of you you can see enemy in the distance but your ally can not so you need to describe the enemy situation by voice command build into the game or if your fast type in like kukulkan have low mana or anubis stun down along with voice command that say ultimate down for my experience the community have be pretty sweet up till 2016 where i start see more troll and rager than ever you will expect some poor scrublord to rage theirat you in any multiplayer game but they do not even know how good you can be in late game team fight which sadly low elo and just incompetent player do not understand,pos

great game with great class mechanic and a nice user interface and combat interface follow d d pretty well with limited flaw from d d and forget relm the pvp system be nice while it be in an arena format you do get some good xp mat and currency from these pvp match win ro loose and be 5v5 platform of pvp it be very fun if any downfall at al it be that the chat system be a bit offish at time with need to hit enter and be a task at time to change channel and talk while quest over all great game,pos
note while my time play metric be really low on steam i have be play this game since the release of open beta last year and have play at high rank for the majority of that time this be an excellent card game it be my favorite card game on the market because it combine excellent card design with board mechanic that facilitate multiple line of play on each turn if you want a card game that strongly reward critical thinking but be easy to pick up and understand i encourage you to give this one a try if you be not a competitive player then this game be still a blast due to it have the most rubust single player mode of any digital card game over the last few month i have alternate between play competitively on the ladder and play the solo content and they have both be great fun,pos
early access reviewi have have this game for a couple day its amazing how much there be to do the music that play during this game make you feel like your on an epic adventure all the time i can not wait to get further in the game so i can use more tool and gadget if your lloking at this game thinking that it look like a minecraft knock off then you be mistake this game be not like minecraft at all except for the world make of block i have not buy the pro yet but i plan to the fact that this game be free be crazy because its amazing,pos
early access reviewdo not even bother with this hot garbage year of anticipation and the good artix entertainment can offer us be a crappy mobage which just happen to be playable on pc sound be sorely lack there be no noise for navigation through menue the launcher be entirely silent and bland 20 second soundtrack play once when enter into area not the tutorial level though which be about as silent as the forementioned launcher crappy fullscreen functionality image be always rescale interior resolution of in game resource seem to be inconsistent and i have not be able to get a non stretched loading screen utilise a premium currency system as the rest of their game have i be impressed they have the tenacity to come up with this kind of stuff since before the release of the iphone minimum expenditure of 5 with crappy starter item right out of the first real area of the game be sell at a value of around two of those five dollar gameplay be absolutely shallow victory be only determine by your level and how many of those 50 cent potion you happen to have on hand camera be hard to manipulate it snap to the direction the character be face during movement and appear to be optimise for touch screen interface ugly ui need a loading screen to talk to npc that will fail a decent amount of the timei do not play this for long so there be no tell how many other thing i have miss,neg
it be mincraft with an awsome twist you start out with a glove that can suck element toward you instead of just drop them and as yuo get well glove you suck thing faster the whole piont of the game be to not to quote another game go deeper into the planet untill you reach the bottom the catch however be it get hard with each layer you go pass and you need a well glove and well armour and wepon aswell in a survival point of view it be fantastic mainly due to there not be the need to manage food or water or sleep or sht like that there be food but its more of a later game thing for exotic pet so they give you more resourses when i say exotic i basicaly mean pet that actively try to kill you if you do not tame them fast enough on the hard mob you really have to trap them in a way they can not knaw your shin off like by get high ground to where you can reach them but they can not jump up to you if you be look for the creative side of mincraft i be afraid that be not realy a thing but creativerse compensate for this by not have food to worry about if you go to bed before the moon of death appear and do not absent mindedly walk of a cliff you will be fine oh and final point do not go within an average restrain order length of a cave without at least 50 tourche full armor an obsidian sword and someone to listen to your frantic yelling of your will,pos
early access reviewi can not believe its free the ending be definitely unique to br genre 0 to 4 team can win as long as one member survive to reach the chopper attachment auto equip which be nice for inventory management,pos
i have allot of hour log into this game and roughly almost every dragon in this game there be pro can con of this game for one it cost money to unlock area and get well item and dragon unless you have at least 3 boulder dragon for stable quest near titan level it be almost impossible to raise gem without real life cash get involve as well the membership for this game be not worth the buy whatsoever do not pay for membership for this game ever for 30 60 one can easily buy the whole game via area buy with gem and a couple dragon egg chest as well while the membership cost around 10 monthly and there be at the moment no way of cancel your membership with a 1 click system so it will continue to take money off even if you do not want it too unless you create a forum page and actually spend the time to write back and forth to a admin be not a admin for the game but just give the info to another admin so it literally take about a week to cancel a membership a normal kid will have no idea how to do this in my honest opinion 2nd the game be cpu intense instead of gpu intense there be no way to change the graphic setting they be perma lock at 1 set and your cpu will do almost everything for the game instead of say your dedicated graphic card 3rd glitch upon glitch in the 125hrs i have play this game i have get lock out of my main viking at least 3 time for several week and i have to go though forum admin and normal admin several time to get back into the viking and at 1 point no one in the world could age up a dragon because there be a huge no age glitch unless you use gem to age them it be impossible and it be not fix for a 2 week time period and there be ton of more glitch in this game that be not noticable tell they effect your gameplay for example the telescope glitch that will not let one click on the telecope on the ice island that have not be fix in around a yr so then you have to do around 20 quest to be able to finish it and click on the telescope in berk to finish the quest on the ice island i do not recommend this game for child for these reason i only play it for so long because i love how to train your dragon so much and own all the book and tv series and movie,neg
this game be constantly be balance and update but its also constantly be fill with cash shop item and hat to suck out your money they say that hat would just be novelty item too but then set hts be introduce,pos
lololol all these negative review there actually quite funny but i do not agree with its a pay to win game join a beginner server and there be tonnss of weapon like seriously pay to win maybe if you do not want to walk everywhere vehicle in the game range from 150k 500k but other than that its quite alright i do agree about the looonnggg wait time and some bug but hey free game i seriously do not know why some people be crash and wait to join server for a half hour i have a low end laptop that i can play on at 20fps and i do not have problem laptop info processor intel r core tm i5 3337u cpu 1 80ghzinstalled ram 8 00gbsystem type 64 bit operating system x64 base proccesorpen and touch full window touch support with 10 touch pointsye it may get boring but hey you can make some more friend through this and also it be much more fun to play with friend give it a shot check for yourself and do not take other people opinion just because they do not like the past producer of the game,pos
this game be just as bad as it be the first time they keep reinvent the game title to suck in new player without make any positive change no improvement to the animation character model environment gameplay no story the only new thing about this game be the add pay subscription for their crap content these developer only excel at rob your money without provide an experience that be worth the price,neg

early access reviewthe perfect game for get shoot in the back constantly spawn in the same place and get shoot in the back again then spawn in a house and get snipe through the wall then die to a random airstrike there s no matchmaking system whatsoever so you in your first match you will get match with the freak who dedicate their life to this game utter garbage really,neg

to be honest i be quite surprise that how to train your dragon be recieve so much love dreamworks be release a new tv series plus later movie i be a jumpstart veteran i have be with jumpstart game since adventure land be release and i have to say the virtual world be get well would love to see more update on their other virtual world like eatmydust and supersecret sadly i must warn you the game do have it be bug gliche and downset for example in fireball frenzy your dragon body be cover some of the bottom target there have be know to be hacker for the game which do make it unfair and can be annoying when you see a 20 foot tall whisper death also if you be plan on get the age up option for your dragon it will not level your dragon up it would only give you the ability to fly now i do have some suggestion perhaps an arena base game you guy have do it before with the monster mutt in mathblaster so it should not be hard recode some part and redesign some texture also you should allow egg buy from the viking store to be use as your first dragon i really want to experience the quest with the changewing from the very beginning,pos
i really can recommend this game to many other player out there i rellay love this game and i nearly play it everyday i just love the game cartoony style and all the nice lil goody like free update not like you have to pay 20 buck for mann vs machine mode its free i buy tf2 in the orangebox when it be not free to play however there be also many cod kid now and its just funny to hear them rage because tf2 be much much hard to play its hard to play because of the fact that the player have to complete a objective while fight in team against each other,pos

as much as i love yu gi oh game there be many well game that you can play other than this it be annoying that the good way for you to get card be by spend real money instead of in game stuff that you should earn by beat other npc also the difficulty do not seem to change even when you level up what i would like be for this game to add a whole lot more such as the normal 5 space instead of just 3 which be dumb space for link and pendelum card and a propper way to earn card that will not mean spend 4 99 or what ever the game price be as well as the crystal thing you sometimes earn just for 5 or 10 pack which only hold 4 or 3 card if this game add a lot more and fix the cash grab problem it have it would be well,neg
this game be really fun although many people think it be a rip off of smashbros it be not th egameplay be much smooth in my opinion and combo be really fun to do and learn all the sound in the game be really cool and be not too annoying to listen too the competitive system be fair and it be easy to learn and get well,pos
i play the game for a long time on mobile and i have to say that on a pc it run better you be able to have much well graphic control be well great game in general and well madeeven though i know blitz do not even compare to the full game it be still a great game for people that want quick action pack game and do not have high end pc plus no arty,pos
early access reviewwas little boring at first but soon as i figure out the mechanic i have a lot of fun play 5 hour straight with my brother today do not even have time to go to the toilet,pos
once this be a promising game but the developer have drive it into the abyss too many change in the gameplay and no proper roadmap make the game a sandbox for the developer the performance be not satisfactory and the networking be modest too so if you like a dead game with performance problem and no future then this be just what you be look for they have a roadmap s but change the whole game be not like update should be,neg
early access reviewcombine the good of 2 world the slick and intuitive design of hearthstone the advanced and comprehensive mechanic of magic the gathering and introduce new one not possible in physical card game while differentiate itself with interesting lore and a generous and worthwhile free to play model,pos
pro great sound great simulation feel cool camera tossing depend on drive surfacecon not free2play the content be on a demo level you can not unlock any content for free you have to buy every single piece of content no multiplayer yetcomment purchache all track will cost you about 40eur and all car will cost you about 15eur at this give time graphic be not impressive but they be still decent if you want to try out all the car and track this game will not exacly be a fair deal in that case you be probably well of with another simulation racing game,neg
please note my hour play be highly unnaccurate i have clock roughly 300 hour prior to have a steam account as someone whose first moba be league of legend smite be really a breath of fresh air for me the grapic be simply amazing and it feel like a large step up for a moba game compare to other out there the one thing that blow me away be just how many event and how many skin you can buy with favor the currency you get just from playing game skin buy with favor be basically just recolor but it be still more than most free to play game would give you smite bring the action right into your face as you play from an over the shoulder camera angle which actually make you have to aim your auto attack something mostly unheard of in a moba before smite come around there be so many mode to choose from and if you pick up the god pack preferrably on sale you get every god ess they release forever it feel like smite just bring so much more to the table than any moba before it one thing that always go overlooked when people talk about smite be the lore the people in charge of create and release new god really do their research into mythology to make the god ability fit their myth or lore as a fan of mythology when i be in high school i find myself read the lore and actually look up some of the god i have never hear of from other culture just to read up on them interested in how they all fit together i have not yet find a god in smite whose ability set do not fit their theme in my honest opinion my only issue with smite as it be now be it be not very new player friendly what i mean by this be if you come from another moba and or that be your main genre of gaming you will be entirely lose on how to work your way around smite as i be to start out the balance be also a major issue that i have notice compare to most other mobas it do not seem as bad until you get further in and the character you hate go against turn up in every game feed beyond your wild dream and stomp all over your team if you be a fan of the moba genre or even just want to give it a shot and want something new in your library i highly reccommend give smite a try,pos
early access reviewprop to the developer for the amazing quality of the game despite be a joke there be a good variety of weapon and they feel solid not to mention they sound amazing the graphic be hand down one of the good i have see the overall quality of the game be staggering and be free to play it be an absolute steal,pos
early access reviewokay so like most thing this game can definately be improve and i would hope that it would consider it be still in beta i be go to say a limited amount of thing since i still do not know too much about the game yet just base off first impression i be run this game on a non gaming notebook and run very well matchmake for the most part seem to be balance i do not really like the spawn system you can either spawn at the main base or a apc jeep but you can not spawn directly on a base you have take at least in the game mode i have play most of the people in this game be not super terrible and seem to have at least average intelligence of how to play as a team it be take quite awhile to rank up compare to how fast i think i would rank up but i guess that be not such a big deal only the fact that you unlock certain class game mode after you reach certain rank i will edit this review as i play this game more,pos
early access reviewthe power flooding screw how you mulligan and how inconsistent your deck play ruin what be a competent online ccg magic the gathering be already an exercise in frustration with its 60 card deck eternal have 75 card deck why this just increase the odd of draw a streak of card you can not utilize result in many game where you literally lose the game without play a unit this combine with the game harsh mulliganing where you can only mulligan once to which you have to dump your whole hand result in a crap shoot that often end up with these wildly polarize hand if you somehow manage to make a game more inconsistent than magic the gathering then you be do something very wrong it be really fun when you get a reasonably balanced hand but too often your option be to draw power for 10 turn in a row or not draw power for 10 turn in a row,neg

nice graphic for a free simulation that be all that there be to it now the negative point in short community gameplay balance mod supprters developer premium as in op and expensive as hell and buggy as hell it get bad with every update and gaijin seem to care less and less detail community friendly fire be the war thunder way to say hello also you have to pay for the repair yourself also you can not disable friendly fire also report friendly firing teammate will make your team a lot weak than it already be after all the quitter leave also there be no way of join a normal game later so you be pretty much ed if you have an on your team i usually have 2 gameplay wow cool as if camping and sniping for hour without end in other game be not bore enough you can now do it in a tank that take 5 60 second to reload after every shot depend on how ed you be mother yay yay king of the hill mode like i have not see that one before yay domination something new yay there be literally nothing interesting in this game except if you like to drive 10 min with a tank at 15 mph to try to flank the enemy just to get one shot also one shot you will get one shoot all over the place do not matter if the enemy be right in front of you or a mile away you will get one shot through building the floor debris dead tank and even ricochet from a friendly unit balance t34 good tank in the world world war win tank with stalinium armor and cryptonite ammo enough say the russian bias be real who would have think it it be a russian game after all interestingly gaijin write about tank at level 1 0 battke ranking that be able to deal with tank at level 3 which be true but they do not change the level of that tank nope seem about right also tank level seem to change with every day pass and depend even of game type you be play but you can not look up the real fact when that very tank have what level so that after you make a decent team and join a game you see that the level be all over the place and your once balanced team suddenly have one very high level member and you now have to fight other player that have way strong unit not as if one shotting be not a huge issue anyway now you can not even retaliate supporter mod developer there be actually a forum where you can post all your bug report just to have them ignore yay each update come with new bug yay old one rarely get fix nay premium how about you pay a on of money to get great unit to fight realone great be not it you be invincible and can one shoot everybody for some cash also you can buy the whole game for million of doller awesome some people actually grind all the stuff for year on end yeah them amirite gaijinalso who the come up with these idea spawn point be not possible to get artillerize but can very well can get bomb airplane should start out be build out of wood so that you catch on fire the first 100 time you fly it until you have research the last def upgrade same applie for tank except there you can not upgrade you def normally but fire extinguisher be not available from the start either also you can not repair your tank from the start either everything have to be researchedyou can help your squadmate repair but not your other teammate it be also not possible to repair a tank if you have not make that specific upgrade even if your squad mate have the same tank as you do and be around to help but you can not start repair fire can not be put out under wateryour crew drown literally in 3 secondsmap usually look like each team just come from their respective base to the battle still you start out with tank all over the place srsly noone drive a tank backwards to battle not even the ai not even 90 tilt also you spawn on in eachother which gaijin only could solve by make your tank impervious to damage for some time at spawn great but useless against all spawnkiller and traffic jam at game start if your tank tire chain be damage your crew immediately refurse any order for a second and stop drive to start repair it asap nice feature right nope you can not hide like this from enemy fire you can not put your tank in a more favourable angle to the enemy fire you will have to wait 4 second to be able to do anything also crew do not give a damn if literally everything else be destroy but hell brake loose if the chain be loose killing ai will not give you any point whatsoever for research your already very weakly start new unit so that it be even more of a pain to try and use new unit also most match have like 50 ai which make for very boring since not very intelligent play the great pro have to face the great noobs fact how else be they go to sustain their high rating this game be not a game it be a simulation gaijin the only thing that differentiate it from other game like world of tank except everything mention be the very unrealistic battle jk but it be true sim battle that noone ing play for many reason that i be not go to get into there be a lot else i do not want to get into too but i think i be exceed the character count would i recommend this game have you read my review do you still want to if you want to camp and snipe around there be well game to do so if you want to go teamkille trolling there be well game to do so if you want to play a beautiful game there be always new one with well graphic,neg

early access reviewlast patch remove the tech tree and give previously low tech weapon tier some benefit over their high tier counterpart this be good now new player have access to flight component they also remove the 100 return on sell item nerfe it to 20 and switch from currency per match base on how much you get do to give you random part this be horrible now new player can stare at those flight component and know that its hundred of hour of playtime to get them also where before they would have be able to experiment with all unlock tech freely due to 100 refund on part now they lose 80 of their progress if they sell piece meanwhile those of us who already have decent block stockpile be rock highly cost efficient robot to smack down noob with that enemy missile launcher you be have trouble with you can have that just play a few thousand match that be not hyperbole it cost 137 5k robit which be 687 5k worth of sell part a match may give you a couple hundred robit worth of part if you be lucky thousand of match and when you have do it you have that one part not open access ot it and all low tier just that one part want to try a sniper helicopter or a gun sled or a bomber that be a whole new grind or you can toss 80 of your effort out the window and sell your shiny missile launcher the old grind be go the new grind be bad,neg
honestly go into this i do not think i would find this game to be as enjoyable as i do it be just a really casual unmoddable version of early minecraft but with more emphasis on material and with more of a vaguely sci fi slant rather than minecrafts vaguely fantasy one there be a few quirk in the engine relate to be build in unity rather than java for instance unitys physics be a bit spotty and sometimes underground mob will hilariously fly through the earth into the stratosphere as if call to rapture however from my end the game seem to run much smooth than minecraft do and it be much easy to set up a multiplayer server the big negative i have for it be that it really spend a lot of time advertising dlc to the point it really start to get annoying but hey at it be heart it be essentially another minecraft and who do not like minecraft,pos
i enjoy many type of game but horror be my favorite genre and as such i tend to be more critical of game that claim to be scary if you have tell me yesterday that a game could be scary cute clever and funny and succeed on all 4 front i may have guffaw at you but i be currently take a breather in room 400 1000 and to date i have have approximately 31 small heart attack and twice as many chuckle i would certainly have pay 20 for this since it be free you have no excuse not to try it,pos
early access review8 10 well than that steal dayz china numba 1 game y solo double squad 4 team mate this be one of the most beautiful game on steam by far 2nd good or maybe the good battleroyale game out there if you can get past all the bs humor funny content this sh t be a 100 legit shooter,pos
in my opinnion the good racing sim out there at the moment great ffb and physics realistic ai that do not file up into a train behind you awesome audio that sound right try out the callaway c7 and compare to the real thing for example people whine about the price but i think the concept work great the starter pack eu map pack will get your realy far and provide more varied online gameplay than for example project car 2 that cost more than twice of that content sure pc2 have more content include but you will not find anyone run it online,pos

early access reviewi much prefer this game to pubg i think pubg have a bit of an identity issue and want to be everything this game balance it out quite nice and the 3 different form of movement really add to the overall pacing of the game my only issue with this game be the combat the refresh rate and the grapple movement option combat seem a bit stiff and favor camping i know camping be inevitable but maybe add a gas molotov grenade to flush people out or something lean should always be a key bind action if implement refresh tick rate of the game seem a bit off on my screen i shoot dead on but die to a head shoot a second later it be always go to be an issue with battle royale game sure but it be still a legitimate claim if they want to be competitive or have a public k d win loss statisitic the grapple movement option be severely limited to the predetermined route on the map and the rock climbing be next to useless and extremely slow a glider player could just get ahead of the grapple player and wait for them to show up to the next point and shoot them or the grappler could risk take a fall and die or attempt to go back up the rappeling line which be extremely slow to turn around they should greatly reduce fall damage for grappler or add a parachute or increase the speed of the grapple movement and landing aslo something can be say about the game end heli but i do not have a solution for that yet overall 7 10,pos
early access reviewlike the game over all have have some fun in the battle you do need too pick the ship you want carefully or you will get hammer the other player be not go to let you slide the graphic have great detail could use a little more detailabout the ship like the armor rating of the ship an there damage mittagation would like the up grade to be accumlative and permaneant as well as expirience point for the crew stat like the game would allso like the taget range ship too have two setting nuetral or combat so you can messure the ship you pick in combat,pos
ok let start of by say i only recommend this game for compititive player with an iq high than a bag of rock people be just so awful in this game we have player run into terrain and shooting at the sky sometimes not even move at all will not stay in group and will not help their teamamte in trouble the list go on and on it really be a fun game though it be an arcade tank game it will not be anything like the original world of tank wot or war thunder it be also not a pay to win you can level up just fine by grind and you also get plenty of free reward like gold and premium tank by simply participate in tournament and daily event,pos

early access reviewthe game be good like two year ago now it be a pay to win grind fest simple minded bullet hell i play two year ago and i think it be a pretty good f2p game not too p2w but there be still someway for the dev to make money there be only car hovercar and plane fine they could have keep the game good but just add cool thing like the insect leg or the tank tread but these massive change be completely stupid i could go on for hour about how the robot tier be remove and robot rank be add be counterintuitive but no i will rather say that the game have go tothere be p2w homing missle launcher p2w anti air cannon and short range teleporter what happen,neg
i still can not believe this be free to play amazing game huge battle lot of play style vehicle basis and on top of that if you choose to you get to play organize as a platoon comprise of 4 squad of 12 player each with amazing coordination if you find the right people one of a kind it be not ptw but cosmetic upgrade can only be purchase with actual cash aside from that anything that be relevant to the game can be buy with in game currency that you earn play the learning curve be a bit steep so give it some time,pos
early access reviewthis game be incredible almost excessively generous ftp model and gameplay that echo the good aspect of both magic and hearthstone while trim much of the fat a highly recommend,pos
early access reviewi expect this game to get well over the year but all the dev be do be try to make it more profitable with microtransaction now i just feel that i waste all that time by expect it to get well this game be now far past its prime and it will keep go downhill the developer be try to force people to spend money when all they need to do be make a good game,neg
while the presentation of this game be phenomenal and the variety of card be already strong this game be extremely stingy with actually give out card with high price slow level gain and wide variance i just do not think this can stand up when compare to other f2p card game on steam,neg
i have be play this game since 2008 this be my 3rd account by the way anyways throughout the year of play this game i have see many change some good one and some bad one it be a very great game to be honest and i would recommend it sure there have be some bad change but keep in note that this game have many people play it after 10 year many people do not realize that if you be new to the game just ignore the idiot experience player call you noobs i respect every f2p and most p2ps most of the old player may think they be well than you and may try to kick you or target you and well they be idiot the community have bad and good people in it the game have bad and good thing in it just try out the game trust me it be a great game sorry if it sound a bit confusing,pos

early access reviewit be not bad it be not great it be not unique and it be not anything new but it be not bad that be say it be worth note this game be still in beta so what we be currently see be just an unfinished product hopefully by the time it come out it will have more in depth character customisation a more unique combat system and vastly improve map design seriously the area in this game be huge for some unknown reason and there be no sprint button either at least not one i have find yet i have not play an adventure quest game since 10 year ago when i be still just a dumb kid who do not know what he be get into it be nice to see that artix entertainment be still alive in kick despite the time that be pass,pos
freestyle 2 cater to both casual and hardcore audience the game simple learning curve allow anyone to just jump in and start have fun as for your main character you get to choose from 5 position point guard shoot guard small forward power forward and center there be also 2 competitive mode team match which be a 3v3 and individual mode be 1v1 co op vs ai mode be also available if you be a fan of basketball there s no reason you should not be play this game its generous it give you free stuff such as clothe and outfit on an almost daily basis premium character for free and an amazingly addictive gameplay experience to top it all off,pos
early access reviewa great experience be since the start proud to be part of this idea work hard on some balance go back and forth on change listen to community and keep the game update will definitely be a great release once they finish tune extreme imbalance between class ps the new update for 07 04 2018 make the game kinda annoying on solo mission with grow hp the rest be just greatgood fun mostly in co op game soloing get boring after a few victory and shenanigan,pos
early access reviewoh the balance issue if you get drop into a crap location your good option be suicide seriously if you do not get a decent weapon nearby you really have no chance after about one minute and when you blast some poor sucker in the first few second with your shotty and he have a knife you kinda feel bad for them but what suck beyond belief be the number of time you get catch in furniture and other prop its a major design engine failure that make it so frustrating the game be not worth play until they fix it,neg
neverwinter be a pretty cool f2p mmo so far lvl 26 i have not notice any paywall prevent f2p player from advance the game have a nice farming grind system to give f2p player some cool stuff overall the game seem fair and be pretty fun the questline be focus and do not branch out a lot but this be not necessarily a bad thing because the quest giver be fully voice and the quest offer more than just the typical go there collect kill x of something esspecialy towards the high level i think the game be nicely cater to newbie mmorpg er but it also offer veteran a good run for their money or in this case for free,pos
early access reviewi like what the game be it have a lot of fun mechanic and feature though a bit unbalanced however i simply can not recommend this game i buy the jekks bounty campaign for a little fun but mostly to get the extra card to hopefully expand the ranked game i be sorry to say but this campaign be absolutely rediculously difficult some boss be easy but the one that be difficult be so beyond difficult it simply make the game unfun i be not oppose to a campaign to play through to gain new card but i should not be stick on one boss for multiple game to which i still have not be able to defeat just to get the reward of card i do not mean to compare this game to hearthstone but at least when hearthstone make me pay extra money for card gain through a campaign they do not make the campaign so rediculously difficult that i basically can not complete it instead they make the main campaign for the card fun and the diffucult part for an extra bonus such as a card back i just do not understand why the developer have to make such a rediculous campaign for some card that just be not that powerful so completely agonizing i be mostly dissapointed that i be stuck on this campaign that i pay for if i could get a refund then i would not care as much but since it be a promo item this mean i be stick with a campaign that simply be not fun and be more frusterating than anything now the bad part about it be that i feel not that i have completely waste my personal time on a campaign boss that i still can not defeat absolutely rediculous figure out how to balance this poor develop completely,neg
i play a lot off steam start back around when plane be in beta as the game have move forward and new thing pop up there be one thing that remain the same and that be a complete disregard for the community and balance and in some case gaijin even in a subtle manner taunt the player base acknowledge the fact that the grind be unbearable as some country and the entirety of the ground force favor pay to not waste your time and it can be many hour or day for late game match have no solution for player be kill in one shot because they do not have any way to repair or stop their tank form burn down while more upgraded tank can result in you beat your head against a wall unless you be go to cheese the game mechanic or get good at snipe and wait for half an hour for stuff to kill be soft cap even if you carry the team to victory although the invisible tank problem still exist but be very hard to catch when it happen it do happen when fight around rubble and there be a lot of it plane have be neglect as they work on new stuff however it be more balanced than ground force but you can cheese the game more and the dev encourage it often draw out battle for little gain and do not even consider the naval battle they be a joke aircraft be pointless and the game try to mimic wow cqc battle with small ship but do bad kill same size ship be a hassle for little gain kill small ship be fun but for little gain and kill big ship require be sneaky but you be soft cap and will not get any further than you would have fight same or similar sized ship for less fun and drag the team down and be unlikely to succeed just a quick thought on the game hope this save people time as get in early mean almost nothing unless you solely play this game spend all your free time as new player get more boost to get past the early pain that you will go through and collectable vehicle get bring back for sale or near impossible event task or you can spend 5 50 100 usd on something that may not be worth buy as you probably leave the game before get that money back in play time however they be good at not revoke thing you earn or buy so if the game become worth play at some point it should still all be there assume someone do not hack your account then there be nothing you can do as their support be nonexistent extremely useless saved incase they decide to go on a neg review deleting spree as they have do in the past,neg
currently the game be awful it lose everything that use to make it any level of good and have now be replace with thing that make it total garbage and not worth play at all quickplay be go it be be replace with some god awful replacement call casual it be bore and do not have the feeling of randomness and surprise that the old pub use to have dosnt help that the queue time be god awful as well i manage to watch 3 entire sgbplay mario party video which be about 1 30 hour long each before enter a single match of badwater that last about 10 minute and in those 10 minute it be not fun because instead of have the old people on pub like the mic spammer who would be entertaining if they do thing like put music or do impression of morgan freeman or the team hoovy spycrab who you could walk up to have a sandvich with and maybe even conga for a few minute now you get a team of tryharde idiot who can not take a joke for the life of them hell even the lenny bind spammer be go this simple move have take all the character and charm tf2 have andall over it next be the balance this game have horrible balancing especially since valve do not communicate with the community to tell them what be come up or take joke people say too seriously or what they seem to enjoy do only listen to the competitive player people like b4nny and mr slin while awesome people be the only one who have their opinion hear by valve and to what have that opinion lead phlog buff of smissmass 2015 and caber nerf of summer 2015 two weapon that be perfectly fine especially the caber which be basically a suicide weapon and after the initial explosion do a fragment of the bottle damage and the phlog become the walk and die weapon of the century this update have bring unwanted unneeded change come on who be complain about the buffalo steak sandvich who complain enough to say it need a nerf next be the communication valve communicate with the community what a pipedream they never tell us what be come up for incoming update at most we get the ocassional neato in the sub reddit and why you may ask because the tf team be 5 people who do not care give aabout their own game overwatch be release one would expect valve to raise their guard their standard and so on no all they do be give us a half bake update with heavy vs pyro which feel like an excuse to not give us a full update from the getgo and stall about a month more out of us for the update if valve simply ask what we want and say that the update be go to take longer than expect we would understand most of the tf community would be happy know that valve do not abandon us and be work on the game meanwhile add the voting system to the game to see which class people want to see more get the update and finally my big gripe with tf2 currently it be more personal and i know i will get ridicule over it but the lack of mac support i run tf2 on mac which some may call but at least i run tf2 at 230 fps well would run it the game be in such a state where the mac support die off about 3 month ago the game constantly crash with the error out of memory or because the game fail to load a single texture not to mention the game load texture one at a time for mac user the first hour be a struggle see how long the computer take through freeze frame lag and so on while it painfully load every graphic one at a time so for the most time you be in a server with all the graphic either blurry or missing while they load in which have take me upward to 3 hour on 2fort alone also the game freeze in the menu in game or most commonly in the retrive server info part of the loading screen i be not sure if windows linux also have these issue but every glitch cause the mac to crash in some way or another there be even be instance where my entire computer not just tf2 but all of it crash due to tf2 fail to load me in the last true patch mac ever get be about 1 year ago in gun mettle where valve do some fix to help with crash cause by the update also anybody on windows linux mind tell me if the game also run like that on their computer this be a tf2 only issue gmod run fine cs go run fine but tf2 do not the game use to be great but the currently influx of bad update bug glitch and crash completly destroy a game that use to be great do not even feel valve be the one make the game anymore it feel like ea or god fobid ubisoft take the wheel with this game,neg

all these people whine about pay to win probably never stay for the event that kog keep put out and why be people complain about the unbalanced pvp when there be so much more to the game no peripheral vision for these thing whatsoever costume and extra skill slot and maybe even some extra mana or anything for in game benefit be all purchase at someones own conscious decision and to everyone bash the game just because they can not get those thing you do not need them kog be not innocent in this either they be make all kind of appeal cash item available to us especially costume and summon but all of this be optional and it do not make or break gameplay the game itself be not pay to win at all and while in pvp ring and such give an advantage but it be mostly skill that people develop as they play dungeon play be great with multiple player and four skill usually do one enough and people complain about the b slot just want to have more skill to use when there be plenty of bread and butter combo and skill to use and as i say early event exist for just that the past few event have quest that earn you a 15 day slot b medal and it be hard to keep throw jab at the game after you realize how generous they be be this be a very well developed game and it have a good team work on it still they constantly put out new event and update that keep the game fresh and it make for a broad range of thing to do when you get tired of do one thing basically unless you play for 12 hour a day to grind experience point the game will always be very fun every time you play,pos
in its current state i can not recommend it mostly due to the sheer level of bs level of grind not to mention the way they treat the community they literally insult the community by compare the m1 abrams a top tier tank with part and fpe which be essential to maintain a combat functional tank with one of their counter argument be that it be always there as if that make it okay these people be hopeless grinding for part and fpe have be make slitghyl easy by remove the need to research two modification to get to rank two which have fpe it will also automatically research track or tire which be one of the most idiotic thing i have have the displeasure of experience we have be wait italian tank for a while now yet we still only have two premium and helicopter can spawn camp from mile away not to mention how frustrating some of the tiering be the kv 1b and kv 1e but the kv 1b be the big problem be just an up armor kv 2 l 11 with a f 34 gun yet it be a low tier and the jumbo have no right to be able to get down tierd into 3 7 recently they have also start make more and more premium top tier vehicle this give any idiot with a credit card a ticket straight to top tier for a while top tier american team be get they crap push in due to noobs buy the xm 1 fill a match that should be fill with people who know their stuff with a bunch of noob make match extremely unbalanced i be not go to be surprised if gaijin end up censor this review but i will keep play it mostly due to how much i be into ww2 tank right now but if another game like this come along or i move on from tank i most likely will not play it ever again we have be promise italian tank for a while now yet we still only have two premium and helicopter can spawn camp from mile away not to mention how frustrating some of the tiering be the kv 1b and kv 1e but the kv 1b be the big problem be just an up armor kv 2 zis 5 yet it be a low tier i be also not go to be surprised if gaijin end up censor this review but i will keep play the game mostly due to how much i be into ww2 tank right now but if another game like this come along or i move on from tank i most likely will not play it ever again,neg
interesting concept but newbie be spawn surround by zombie without anything in their inventory and no weapon if you can actually make it to the area where there be item and weapon there be usually high level there wait to kill you its not really fun once you die you lose everything you have and have to start over after do this ritual about 10 time i have never actually make it a full day without get kill by a high level yeah pass on this one,neg

dcs world be not for the casual gamer or the slow learner as make obvious by some of the tone set by other reviewer your cognitive capability will truly be put to the test if you choose to tackle this complicated yet rewarding simulator the mission editor manual be 250 page the book for flame cliff alone be 150 page and that be just one plane the f15c this game will challenge you and that be put it lightly for me personally dcs be the only simulator that have capture my attention enough for me to dedicate my time and resource to learn it page by page,pos
i love this game they balance it really well so that there be not a whole lot of idle time at least not until high level when you start to hit your partys limit at that point restart your game will reward some idol which give permanent dps damage per second and gold percentage increase so the next time through you will be able to get further you only have to click to kill with your start character the bushwhacker all other automatically do damage to the close enemy on the screen and it do not take long to save up and recruit the 2nd character so if you do not like to click spam then this game do not make you do it much but if you do like it there be plenty of upgrade to make it worth while it be totally up to you whether or not to click for extra damage after you recruit the 2nd character i always replace the bushwhacker with someone else as soon as i have recruit that many character some character do high dps some boost the dps of other character and some increase the amount of gold enemy drop so there be a strategy to decide which character to field in your party depend on your immediate goal there be three save slot so you can save different party configuration and quickly switch between them i like to have a dps party for progress and a gold find party for when i log off or if i want to save up for something another fun strategy be rearrange your party member for maximum dps output some character boost the dps of erveryone in front of them and other boost the dps of everyone next to them so put your high damage dealer in a position to get boost by both most character have a skill that quadruple their dps output every 25 level and there be no limit to this that i know of every five level have a boss character with a chance of drop a chest chest have large amount of gold as well as item that your character can equip for bonus the item stay with your character after reset the game if you find a duplicate item for a character their dps be permantently boost by a small percentage i can not think of anything bad about the game it be what it be a casual side scroll click idle rpg with basic but cute graphic it be not diablo or grim dawn but like those game the magic be in the gameplay decide what to upgrade next saving up for it get it and watch the satisfying effect of your good choice as your dps meter skyrocket and the enemy start die almost instantly then you can advance a few level where the enemy be a bit tough but the gold drop be much rich and gladly do it again,pos
i really wish i could recomend this it be free and omages classic horror in clever way but it commit the cardinal sin of horror it be bore the jumpscare be surprising but end up just annoy quickly the room appear random and that just kill any imersion that may have be build i be on floor 200 and i just do not care enough to finish,neg
now let us just be clear here i like this game but i do not recommend it because i do not think many other would you see i do not really care what i do in a game i could just be walk around and i would enjoy it but that be pretty much all there be to this game just walk around a few fetch quest to do nothing much there be not even a story just get a dragon and perhaps grow some carrot the game be full of monotonous repetitive task that would leave most bash their keyboard to kingdom come out of boredom so therefore i deeply suggest you do not download this game and if you do i will shed a tear if you spend money on it really,neg

early access review note it be still an alpha a few bug but so far nothing game breaking or anything that cost me a fight core diffrence from fornight any unwanted loot can be exchange for shard a resource you can use at a forge to generate gear the armor shield be make from the armor you pick up the well the armor the more capacity you have for the armor bar which can be refill with a potion the class ability be very fun and add anew dynamic to fight additionally the fact you can get upgrade version which due more damange and short cooldown be also nice the rng of loot drop can be mitigate by use a forge scrap the useless stuff go to a forge and have it generate you a top tier class specfic weapon armor or ability at any point you can press z to summon a horse to get around climb mountain quicker when your down instead of lay their and need to wait for an ally you instead turn in to a chicken as a chicken you can run jjump around hop through small window to avoid get shoot and if you live 30 second you auto revive ally can not revive you instead their task on focus to keep you alive the map biome theme be pretty fun and diverse you can go froma frozen tundra to a barren desert to a jungle temple etc while it seem more cartoony than fornight even the variety of location and consistant art style and tone keep it visually appeal the gun system be simple with some uniqe gun poison bow hunter only etc very important when you deploy from the bus you do not parashoot you do a hero land you just crash land somewhere like a badass no fall damange other feature in game voice chat game modes duo squad only,pos

early access reviewwall of text inbound great game amazing game i love this game to piece at least i use to the game be awesome up until recently than crate arrive actually i should not blame one update i suppose if i be to pinpoint the starting point for this disappointment i would have to point my finger at the introduction of the crf this feature which i would like to say be nice in concept intensify an already present issue within robocraft and set in motion a domino effect that more or less lead to the train wreck we have before us today the crf allow for the rapid deployment of op bot or rather exploitative build i be go to use the tesseract as an example while not a huge issue on its own it be the way freejam go about resolve this issue that make matter bad to any veteran of the game that have some knowledge of the problem the simple and least devastating fix would have be to nerf corner slope health to the point where use as armor would be ineffective a more complex fix would have be to fix the exploit that allow the construction of the build armor sadly freejam do not choose these option and instead decide to add not 1 but 3 now 2 but still weapon design to deal with these build while the build be successful in their intend task they also take the rest of the game aerial population down with it this be not a review whine about badly balance aa though so onto the next nail shortly after this fiasco fj introduce epic loot a system widely revere as the complete opposite of its namesake alongside rip out a system that be work just fine and be much simple to balance they supplement this change with a system that could be best describe as gamble in a system where the house win 9 time out of 10 instead of a system where player could either work for or pay for a specific item they desire they be now force to test their luck with crate crate that logically fail to reward a player common sense dictate that high tier crate should award better loot this make sense the crate fj have force upon us do not follow such logic high tier crate rarely reward suitable loot in fact it would appear from my experience that low to mid their crate be more likely to reward a player effort this be ing stupid period there be also the complaint regard the premium row flaunt item however this have not really annoy me as much as other move on to the big one a lack of communication between the community and the developer can and will be this game downfall if every problem list before this be group tight and weight as a whole they would not come close to overtake this issue as simple as this problem be it be so bad in fjs case the simple action of posting plan for balance change or suggestion on the game dedicate forum be so foreign to those in charge that someone look in from the outside would likely see it as nothing more than a place for angry customer to vent why no dev will respond with exception of drognin but it be his job as community manager and we love him for it 3 the dev that have a proper power over the game development use twitter instead of their own forum it be dumb anyway as if this be not long enough i will quickly list the pro and con of the game so tl dr pros 1 builder may be entertain if they get good stuff 2 not pay to win because buy crate just mean you get more crap con 1 dev be usually silent unless they be be praise 2 balance weapon what be those 3 exploit meta build everywhere creativity doessnt seem to be a major concern to fj 4 hope you enjoy gamble i really like this game but sadly i can not recommend it to anyone because for 1 you be not reward for and the dev do not seem to intent on fix the issue,neg

this game be a kind of simulation of airplane you be able to fly certain plane in a simulated environment in military mission there be many plane available though most be extra dlc you only get the soviet su 25 t for free which be still very fun to play generally you should have a joystick with thrust and use either trackir or something like facetracknoir to control your head movement in the cockpit also important to mention be that the different dlc also call module with their plane have different simulation difficulty some have a non clickable 3d cockpit with simplyfied flight model and some like the a 10c require you to basically learn how to start up and fly the plane in a way you would do in reality with all it be button switch and so on overall it be a great game not the most accesible but the free plane be great to explore whether you like this game and you can always decide to go more hardcore with other plane or difficult mission aaaaand you also get the free mission editor campaign editor which allow you to create your own content so all sum up you like flight simulation and fighting jet try this it be nice,pos

early access reviewjust recently invite to play the beta i be barely at even 2 hour play time i have to admit i be a huge fan already maybe because i like super smash on nintendo so much it really be quite simular but have it be own nice difference to stand out i like the way you be able to unlock so many thing collor skin weapon and even the possiblety to level up character the way to do this could be a little bit more faster now you can earn gold with mission and i feel it be a bit slow never the less it be a beta so thing can change for example i hope to see character unlock by a story or tournement besides the normal way there be now also the money i earn with mission be ok but i can only do a set number each day wich make it slow last thing i feel the shield need some more work the difference with smash be nice but the dodging could be well could also mean you need to train more in it the good thing i like be the unlock and defenitly the weapon every character can use two different one from the start i believe they can use more later what be nice with it be the light and heavy attack every light attack be the same with every character but the heavys differ this go for every weapon a character can use this way there be something femiliar and something different to try out with every character and they be start weapon besides this the non weapon fighting do not change every character have the same non weapon move,pos
i like it more than hearthstone tbh i have play for a few day and i already have more legendarie and way more epic than in hs and i have play that game for almost a year also you get 6 card per pack and i think drop rate be a lot better adjust mecahnically the game be basically hearthstone with a few new thing so it be all good plus tes have great lore if you be tired of work so much for a single legendary in hs play this you will love it,pos
best most beautiful hunting game ever trap behind paywall and subscription hell even the mission for in game money have paywall i be not poope you need more free before i would even consider this a f2p game there should be allow more specie that can be hunt for free or just unlock whole map for free hunting then lock some map for member only that can be rent with gm instead of have straight up liscense for individual animal have more starter equipment with the ability to rent other gun with gm i love this game but its free to play title it have right now be utter nonsense its a demo that s it,neg
early access reviewi use to play aq on the web around 4 5 year ago now i be play on the computer i have to say it be quite fun and show a lot of potential sometimes i would lose all my progress for no reason and have to go through the intro again but that be a bug and probably will be fix soon some quest be confuse and have you have to search for 20 minute try to find out what you be suppose to do i wish it have a map that i could refer to other than that i find it quite fun to play and you should try it when it come out,pos
just another uninspired card game which more or less force you to buy ingame currency if you want to progress faster than a snail fun for 5 10 hour but after that just frustrating since you do not have the strong card as seemingly all the other,neg
the game be great i have be play since the early early open beta around a year or 2 ago and love it i would have give it a 10 10 but now ever since a patch that come out around last december i would give it a 2or3 10 the gameplay be the same and be very fun to play whether alone or with friend but now you have to grind grind grind grind grind just to get 1 plane before i could just buy plane after plane in tier but now i have to grind for research point which be very hard to earn to research a plane plus gajiin go and have to make the game go from free2play completely only buy if you feel like it to have to pay if you want to unlock a new plane in less than 50 match or more you basically have to buy golden eagle so you can convert them all to research point to speed up the research of a new plane i would still reccomend this game if you be into fun aviation type game and play with friend but the free2play aspect be just no longer here,neg
with almost 300 hour on this game and my first ever steam review i can firmly say that this game be absolutely fun to play however unless you be willing to put much of your free time into this game you will not go far it be not a game for people who just want to pick this game up and play it you need to invest time or money will talk about this in a bit with almost 300 hour although i have almost all the playable unlockable ever class unlock exclude vanguardian and many cosmetic mastery 298 you gain these mastery point from cosmetic and level up i be nowhere near end game for an mmorpg although i have access to all the content i just can not deal enough damage to be invite to late game run a because i do not have time to grind constantly and b i do not spend enough money you can get anything in this game over time without spend money however it be tedious because get well be much on rng without spend a ton of money gameplay wise this game be really nice 6 10 however if you do not want to spend more than 50 on this game it would bring you almost no fun without 300 hours4 10 overall,neg
want to point out to the new player that the economy and balance be effed out of the universe so be aware however the game be enjoyable until tier 4 that be y all have a good game,neg

early access reviewlooke at it for what it be a cross platform phone pc tablet it be not that bad face it this will never look like black desert on pc it will look the same as in your phone so no point in point out the obvious or ok no graphic be not that good for a pc game in the year 2016 but ok for a tablet pc cross platform thingy but that be fine game like this be best play on your tablet anyway while do no 2 or hide in the garage from your wife who want you to take her on a trip to ikea with that say it be pretty basic so far no surprise classic mmorpg formula and it get a long way to go before it be do but i see some potential in it as it be so i will give it a thumb up for now it be free and only 50 mb ish since the game be mostly serverbase i guess so why not try it out and see for yourself only thing i notice that annoy me a bit be some delay while zone and looting but it be beta guess it will get sort out in the future,pos
probably one of the good and bad arpg that i have play it be great in the aspect that it allow a lot of customization of your character build and in turn enable a lot of different playstyle the game fail in the aspect that it the playstyle you choose you be effectively stick with there be little tactical about the combat in this game outside of spamme what your build be good at and then hope for the good,pos
fallout shelter have arrive for pc as a mobile port itatms still a bethesda game and itatms still fallout but can a mobile fallout game work on steam first of all the game be free to play so yes you guess it it have micro transaction in it but i will write about that a little later the grafix in the game be very true to fallout and that please me when i see that itatms very well make and you actually get the feeling that you be play a fallout game now the game start of as you been a manager of a fallout shelter and you give it a name then you be take through a tutorial of some of the basic and then you be set and go for the rest the problem be though you still donatmt know half of what you can do in the game or what the game later will introduce you to there be a help section and i can only recommend you read it because it give you valuable information on how to management your dweller into the right place so you get fast resource and this be where the problem really start in my opinion and where it show that it be a mobile port the waiting time you have to wait for resource be pretty long when you really canatmt do much else 2 4 minute to be allow to press a button to get resource be a long time the first 30 min you be pretty occupied with the game because everything be new but then it start get bore there be small event that happen like animal infestation or attack on your vault but thatatms pretty much it i be miss a more eventful game maybe earthquake or something else than a fire that can happen because you try to be greedy with rushing resource the game have different item armor gun and pet in it that make it more interesting and it be cool have your dweller run around look different a way to increase your population be to make love and produce babyatms and that be a funny feature again though it take soooo long time to actually produce a new dweller and have it grow up to be able to work in your room now if you get pass the waiting time and play it as a normal pc game you will eventually get enough dweller to unlock the observere room where the more interesting part of the game open up be able to send your dweller on quest be a nice feature but yet again the time it take to do something be brutally long range from 30 min to 5 6 houre for your dweller to get to a location be something you just will not sit and wait for this be yet again a place where the mobile part of the game show because you be more inclined to close down and look at it again later when you be on your mobile phone than on a pc you donatmt want to open up a game to play for 10 minute to close it down again wait for new thing to do when you actually get to play a quest you get a new mini game where you have to kill something or answer question about fallout i like this part in the game i just donatmt like have to wait 1 hour plus to be able to do it off course if you use nuca cola which be the real money currency in the game you can get there instant and now my rant start the starter pack be 4 99 euro which be fine you seem to be get a decent amount of thing but then the price go up 4 5 euro for 6 nuca cola when it cost maybe 8 to go instant be way overpriced i be inclined to say that if you do not pay money for the game you canatmt play it as a pc game and have to play it as a mobile wait game and that be where i get annoyed if you port something to a specific console you should really make sure that the game be still fun for none pay player or ask a decent price for it and lower the time for thing to finish even minimise the game to try will eventually pause the game have it to reload when you return and if you havenatmt buy the starter pack you donatmt have the handy auto loot machine run around pick up loot for you yet again you be lose out when you donatmt pay the sound in the game be standard for a mobile game itatms not great but itatms all right it work for fallout shelter should you play it well that depend if you want a game where you be occupy all the time and have to wait for thing to finish be a bother for you without pay for it then this game may not be for you if however you donatmt mind have a game you open up from time to time and play for 10 minute maybe 30 if you do a quest then this can could be just what you need in your life,neg
early access reviewafter play the game for more than 100 hour i decide to write a review the developer update from time to time so there be new weapon mode and map and i can guarantee you it be not p2w every weapon available in this game can be acquire just through play the only reason you may want to buy in game currency be for skin either weapon or character skin graphic be not amazing but good enough i have a lot of fun with black squad and it be free so give it a shot try it out,pos

if you enjoy wait 5 10 minute for a match then match that be entirely unbalanced and then have the match overrun with hacker then look no further i always hear people complain about hacker in fps game but this be the first time i have see actual scripting it be uncontrolled and unchecked the admin do not do anything because the hacker pay actual money to purchase item in game if you manage to find a well balanced game without hacker it can be fun this happen very very rarely please look at my hour play i know what i be talk about if you play in the game american team lose 9 10 game this be not an exaduration once you commit a soldier to an alliance he can not change you have to start over as a german or russian this be seriously the bad production for an online game acceptable issue in beta not in a finished product game designer if you be listen get your hacker under control until then bye,neg
an excellent variety of ship with different playstyle i do not play a lot of space combat game but the tutorial lead you through nicely and the space comabt meet my expectation of what space combat should feel like great hulking ship with a massive array of beam and laser canon and small more mobile ship with cloak function and other trick on a free to play level it do not take much grinding to get whatever ship you want and the ship be relatively balanced however i have experience a few game populate by toxic player that trashtalk other player even those that be obviously new to the game but there be an option to report such player,pos

ok so overall i think this game be very good it have its main server and stuff for those who just wanna casually play but not just sit around it have trade server so people can screw around and trade stuff and the community server have all the various mode that be not commonly available or those that be not available at all very strong community and very strong game with load of variation all for the low low price of free heavily reccomend it,pos

early access reviewgreat gameplay reminiscent of all the great tcgs for an early access the art be above the par better than hearthstone already and much easy to get into and to amass in game currency it be the good online tcg i have ever play and almost well than live magic the gather people have issue with the deck size be too big and get mana probs but those individual have probably never play magic it all just depend on balance mana and that be a problem that be easily remedie by just learn how to build properly as well do not play online unless you have a well deck than the beginner series the matchmaking system care not for your deck content so you will be match with high tier deck than your beat the campaign first amass coin in gauntlet get some new card and build a well deck first amazing game wonderful content awesome gameplay long running battle provide your opponent do not play aggro deck with absolutely wicked play that can be make with the large mana draw this game have compare to magic 10 10 would recommend again,pos
this game be continuesly compare to league of legends and dota 2 and for good reason though generally look at primarily as a league of legends clone smite actually take a different approach into game mechanic and especially p o v point of view where as league of legends and dota 2 work out as a more linear top view design smite do in a third person persepective where you can see the area around your god now for the game mechanic it be pretty straight forward with w a s and d as your movement key 1 2 3 4 as your skill mouse 1 as your attack and mouse 2 as a cancel key and e and f as your relic like league of legends and dota 2 itemization be key into first learn how to play and the role be pretty similiar in the competative level a solo laner usually bruiser a mid laner usually a mage range champion a jungler usually an assasin type or tanky and can initiate an adc apc generally range champion but can be magical damage base as well and a support generally with hard crowd control peel or initiation disengage the community may not be as big or as widespread as other it be compare to but the one it have be strong and continue to push update patch and change mostly positive to the game as a whole and i wish it continue to do so as hirez in my opinion do a good job in make sure the community interact with its developer overall i would give smite a 8 5 10,pos
for those who be curious about this game but do not know what its all about imagine the lovechild of minecraft and planet explore both very good game this be a survival crafting game with a tech approach very interesting concept i buy this game when it be first release at the time it be buggy incomplete have very little to do and the game environment be very plain and boring so i uninstalle it and forget about it i do not remember how much i pay for it but i feel very disappointed in the game i just reinstall it yesterday and find out that the game have go free to play you now have to pay a fee if you want the add feature i write to the dev and ask them about the pro package and how it apply to people who back them on release they reply to me within a few minute of me post my question in the forum probably the fast reply i have ever see they say anyone who buy the game would get all the pro feature for free i be delighted that i do not have to repay for anything so i get back into the game and see that there be so many more feature and texture and block to play with that they do not have before unfortunately this game be still unfinished i be disappoint that they have not yet do anything with the water biome or create aquatic creature but the rest of the game seem pretty solid they be lack with the variety of creature you encounter and i be hope that more will be soon to come i think i will put this game on the back burner once again until this game be more finish so for right now it its current state i recommend people put it on their wishlist and check back from time to time to see what progress the game developer have make but for right now i would not want people to buy this game it have great promise but it still have more that need to be do keep up the good work dev bring us more content and keep us post with development,pos

while i have only play about 2 7 hrs as of 20160927 the game have pull me in quite a bit i be not a fan of mobas but the title do a really good job at mask the moba concept it adopt 5v5 with two lane essentially and an arena in the middle that open up occasionally during battle the team base combat do not feel too pushed but you can really feel the necessity when fight against human player as with most competitive mobas perhaps my favorite feature of the game be the f2p aspect in essence this be how all f2p title should work if you choose to spend money it do not give you an advantage over other as you be only unlock the ship and crew member soonr as well as obtain skin for ship overal this title be a must play i mean come on it be free what do you have to lose just uninstall it if you do not like it,pos

dtm experience purchasable in game be overpriced 40e do not represent the quality of this game as it be i would say 20e would be a good price 25e a decent price and 30e a high end price 40e be simply too much unless the 1 0 version of this game will be of significant well quality which i think it will be because it be only in beta0 2 at this point so nice game but need plenty of development and as be it be overpriced,pos
early access reviewit look great it sound great it play great and it do not feel like it pay to win heck i would even say it do not feel like a free to play game it be not perfect yet however server stability should be improve and matchmaking should not under any circumstance match you up with player that have 200 ping but that be say this game have huge potential if they can keep the micro transaction limit to cosmetic item and tweak the server a bit this may be my new go to game,pos
at first glance seem to be a minecraft rip off in actual fact the creator have apparantly take the block concept and do something very different with it it be very very enjoyable and i have only play about an hour so far can not wait to explore more if you be go to compare it to something minecrafty then probably something between mc and tekkit here,pos

early access reviewokay i have be prove wrong before when i have enjoy a game in beta but i really hope this go through into actual full release when people say it be like smash they be right when thy say it be a smash clone they could not be any more wrong the basic set up be very smash esque but the play be a style in its own right you play on a 2d stage with minor element of hazzard such as pit fall and smash an opponent off the stage which be all very smash like but where it come into its own be its style of combat you all start off bar fistedwhich all have the same move set of a straight knuckle upper and sweep to knock an opponent off but each character have two set of weapon which you obtain randomly from pick up in on the stage a good few seem they be clone but most have their own unique combat style and flare make no two the exact same to play as you also play with low gravity and a lot of move capable of keep you air bear make for some cool air bear fight and juggle even when it seem to be over when you be fall to your death you can make an epic come back when you use the right move from the edge of the stage the combat style be what i love the most though about the game it be all fast all go with no time to rest yet it flow really nice and keep you excited even if you be lose you be still just enjoy the rush and pace to top off each character have their own bio and be quite unique in the look department and varied there be quite a selection already and can not wait to see what other character they release and what new weapon they include all in all if you like smash get it if you like a decent and develop fighting experience with quirky character get it if you just want a game to let off steam on or just enjoy pvp get it,pos

early access reviewwhile i do not play for very long it be like a complication due to the manner in which i be play over a verizon dsl network streaming from a windows 7 pc to a window 8 laptop the main problem i encounter be a slow network connection from the router not the game fuzzy graphic that do not want to play nice and display properly on my laptop likely a result of not configure them properly on my desktop first or even have to do with the router again and drop from game in the middle of a fight which i can blame on verizon once more but it may have have to do with the game itself overall i would recommend this game the gameplay i do experience have a focus on teamwork on strategic maneuvering to enable you to appropriately apply the force you have at your disposal from fly a capital ship and well 3 dimensional movement in space combat be always nice this game be for you if you have the patience to play a moderately pace game be willing to work with your team mate even if they be stranger and have be look for something that focus on large ship space combat this game will not scratch your itch if you be look for a game like tie fighter vs x wing you will not by fly small fast fightercraft and engage in dogfight and that be okay there be other game that do that some in space some not so much war thunder last i play do a very good job in give you plane to fly around and dogfight in overall it look like a game with a good amount of potential that have already live up to a fair bit of it it be an early access game so expect bug but the feature that be already in from what i have see lie out the foundation for a solid game,pos
this appear to be a mobile console game port over to pc it certainly play like a mobile game it would feel right at home on my droid turbo 2 that should be enough say if you be look for any level of decent tank combat simulator because this be just not it edit i actually look this game up after post this it literally be a mobile game port to steam i have see some folk mention in their review to skip this and get the full wot game from their website also free but i would say skip both and go for war thunder i start play that game in 2012 2013 and i never play tank until recently and it take a while to get use to into it come from plane but now it feel much well and more natural than this game i download this because i play this game long before tank on war thunder and i enjoy it but this just do not compare to todays ground force in wt can not wait for naval force over there either,neg
download it a couple day ago play 16 hour straight it be very smooth addicting and huge mmofps it be not just a fps the game work a lot like real war infantry need air support and tank support to take location in total they be hundred of location to take faction choice be more preference base then gameplay change base you get some different look stuff and some faction have well stat towards item that there faction be advertise to be you can not log into this game as an experienced fps player and expect to go 40 5 score like you may in cod or other related game this game be about teamplay and stratergy they be 6 different unit type all of which can counter or push or sneak the enemy to help your team group unit outfit clan faction take an objective i still do not fully understand the game which be a surprise since i be one of those kind of 40 5 player when it come to fps game on the pc however this be not a game where you call people noob or get godly score infact most people do not get good score the game say you can die a hundred different way and it be practically true the game be about the real war vibe soldier attack objective die over and over until air and tank support finally take over sound 9 10 very realistic and immersive make you feel like you be in an actual war with the light off pgameplay 10 10 can feel unfair at time but the over all goal and experienced be more then achieve by the game combat 8 10 again can occasionally feel unfair but not unabalance luck can help as well as group play air combat 11 10 so realistic and responsive require a lot of learning and practice to dominate tank etc 9 10 very realistic but can not be effectively fire use third person shut you down from your surroundingpay2win this game be free to play some gun be cash only but a lot of gun be in game credit you will find yourself somewhat grind here i be only able to unlock some gun attatchment and upgrade after 16 hour of gameplay however the beginner gun be very good they be not make crap to force you into buy you could happily and easily use all the beginner item forever and be a good player however i feel some cash gun do offer advantage but it be strange the pace at which someone can die be never change by the gun some gun just assist the person mean if you be a good fps player it will not matter if you be a new fps player or a bad one you will often find yourself over power by cash user over all not anywhere close to p2w ps the sniper unit can cloak small vehicle and fire from them whilst remain cloak sniper unit can also use some rifle be stealthe with a rifle for me be a broken aspect of this game and one i do not enjoy or support snipe it be nothing like call of duty or other fps game so if you be a quickscoping fanboy do not bother with this game sniping be very realistic you have to aim where your opponent will be bullet travel time and distance vastly affect your aim also most beginner sniper do not one shot unless headshot but do lot of high damage which be how it should be like air combat sniping actually require practice over all rating 9 10 completely free to play no hacker that be overkille the game lot of stratergy group and action not pay2win addictive and balanced feel like cod battlefield good of both world with slightly less graphic compare to say battlefield i would say on max setting this make any cod game look simular graphic i have a msi nvidia gtx 970 over clock at maximum overclock and i get 100 120 fps with very high setting in fight of 1 12 or 12 24 i get about 60 80 fps in fight of 24 48 and 60 70 in fight of 48 96 and 96 the texture of the game be somewhat ugly compare to other game but this be often misunderstood as a bad thing you have to load about 30 400 player in one somewhat small objective area at one give time include the sky the tank and turret mine the map itself the rock and map design and filler include helicopter etc all move at once i feel the texture be bad for a reason the game be unplayable on any standard none gaming gpu amd nvidia be require at atleast about 70 per gpu 2 gpus or 200 for one gpu to run the game at an eye pleasing level,pos

this game have be out only a few month and i have somehow play it more than any other game in my libary for a free to play it be very generous for a card game it be easy to learn but hard to master and very intresting with alot of option and the card have very good detail and lore to the series a must try for people want to learn about card game and for people who enjoy the elder scroll series,pos
early access reviewi have play a lot of other card game this card game be the good replacement for mtg fan who love standard or modern but could not get through the major pay gap but hate the uninteractive aspect of other online tcg game like hearthstone the big difference from mtg be that counterspell can not counter creature which in my eye be really nice those big creature that you love to play so much will not be circumvent by a silly 2 drop counter spell in their full hand they also do not have a silly thoughtseize god i hate go second against someone with a turn 1 thoughtseize something people can explain say better than me be about the pve element not to familiar with how they compare to other but i quite enjoy it anyways i actually enjoy this a lot more than mtg and hearthstone,pos

ok so its dota 2 the large and most popular game on steam at the time of writing if you do not have this game and you be an avid gamer you will most likely pick up this game at some point due to the fact that it be free and well why not from a graphic point of view at maxed out on a gtx 660 easily it look fantastic and that be not even the good graphic card so the requirement arnt huge but much low than that on budget pc with the bad graphic card ever and you may get a few people compaine about your wooden pc increase the time to load up into the game and if bad come to worse you can turn it to complete minium and i bet you that even if you laptop have one of the bad gpu on the market you can eventually get it to run at a playable pace from a gameplay point of view as you can see i have spend well over 500 hour on this game so it must be pretty good and some other reviewer have spend from 1000 hour and above the reason well there be 1 map that have a few variable that can change the game such as the rune weather you get a good creep from the jungle to control and take on your enemy with so 1 map you think hummm that must be pretty limited well yes i would kind of agree with you but the fact be that becuase of the 100 hero and many hero combination and counter no game be the same with each game change the way you play slightly depend the character you play how you play it and who you be against and how they play it so the game do take a while to get old and even then have the same map mean that you can really know it like really know it how to do specific techneque and pull creeps where the enemy hero can see you and how to position yourself so in that term the gameplay remain fun and interesting while still for player like me challenge the community this be the one issue you get with this game some people be not very forgiving for your mistake and there be a lot of anti russian stuff mainly because when you go to play on an english or us server and you get strange man shout at you and your team in a strange language that no one on your team but him can understand people get a little to say the least annoyed althrough the high your battle rank and mmr i will talk about that later mean that eventually you will get player who actually make an effort to co ordinate with you the rank system and how valve make its money so the game be free and so how do valve make its money well first let me explain the ranking system basicaly after each game you will recieve an ammount of battle point for you to increase your battle point level each level you will recieve an item i think and acasionally you will be able to open a present to get free item these item can also be drop through luck randomaly to people at the end of the game valve also sell hero costume in the dota store in game shop these item will only change the look of your character and will not actualy affect the gameplay which i find very unique and mean that there arnt huge pay to win in the game which annoy me hugely when people make a good game and then make it pay to win these costume item be very effective with the steam market allow player to sell their item cheaply to other player but valve still profit of that by take a transaction fee also due to the popular steam workshop player can submit their item design to be avaliable in game and they will also get a cut of the money make which be a nice thing for new artist to make some money while have something to potentially put on a cv also when you reach a battle point rank of 13 you will unlock rank matchmaking which will allow you to play game with other people of that level 13 and high to increase your mmr with the top mmr be 7500 and bottom 0 you really have to be bad to get 0 with 5000 mmr be very high mmr be for more serious player that want to really test their skill with other of that level but on a down side note 2000 2700 mmr be very hard to get past as there be people from all different ability so that can be a little dificult to get past but eventually with experience and a little luck you will get past and eventually be on the climb you your ability level this conclude my review for dota with a few 10 10 statisticsalso please consider take a look at my youtube channel where there be some dota content and some help video for new player 8 5 10gameplay 9 10community 6 10 as it get well later onranke progression system 9 10,pos
i have spend hour upon hour play diablo 3 i love that game too this game be pretty awesome in it be own right but while they come from a similar mold the two game be as different as night and day i think both be good personally but what make this game really amazing be the outstanding value this game give everything you would expect from a triple a developer literally just give it to you nothing that be sell in the store be in any way go to help you win the game unlock content that be need or give you a special edge in the game it be a full on retail value game literally for free play it all you like make up to 24 character have a huge share stash by default i be go to end up support this game eventually when i get the money not because i have to but because i want to this game make you want to pay for it because it be freak awesome if this have not get you interested i do not know what else will but if you be a fan of diablo torchlight or the genre in general you should give this a whirl without a doubt,pos
after spend countless hour into this game i feel i be ready to give my side of a review yugioh have be a trend ever since the anime show of yugioh plus people like us duel with card like in this game it be a very fun concept duel where player vs another player duel against each other use monster trap and spell card it be one of those game that make it very fun to play and still this game be originally from mobile now i will get to the most detailed part when you start the game you have 2 legendary duelist you can start off with seto or yugi pick any 2 do not impact further into the game because you will eventually unlock more new legendary duelist by complete mission what be great be most card be very balanced however the downside be cut 2 trap spell and 2 monster zone from the original mat but you still have graveyard field zone extra zone for your fusion monster you can compete against the world duel with your friend buy card pack available to buy hope you score well card customize your deck your card and mat layout there be alot you can do oh do i mention you mobile user can transfter your datum to your pc well now you can if you do not wanna drain your phone battery by play duel link well you can play it on your pc instead in conclusion i would truly recommend this game to any yugioh fan out there despite not have 5 monster zone and 5 trap spell zone 3 each be not half bad give this game a try you will not be disappoint,pos

excellent little game some other review s have complain about the fact that in order to disassemble the choose gun you have to do it in a specific order of part while yes this be unrealistic the game have time trial to entice some competition and incentive to play it over and over again and to give muscle memory through repetition and allow you to do it faster the model be all very detailed the control be also all excellent as be the hitboxe for some of the small part when you be click on them even if your click be not super extra precise the soundtrack be not super annoying to me personally which be a major bonus i highly recommend this game for people that be interested in gun or just want to kill some time tl dr good game much fun decent sountrack high replayability massive variety much detailedness do download and play,pos

team fortress 2 seem like such an understatement when i say i recommend this it be probably my favorite game of all time with over 2000 hour log on it even though people may not like the hat and new item personally i think that be what keep this game alive every time the game feel like it be get boring or repetitive they add something new that make the game feel fresh and fun this be the only game i think i would ever give a perfect 10 10 because the game always expand the community on the other hand be quite a lot like the sonic fanbase and i will just leave it at that in conclusion if you have not play this game before do it i can not stress that enough download it and play it it be free but i highly recommend buy something in it at some point in time,pos
early access reviewmagic the gathering be know as a definition of tcg but at some point with all those expansion and new mechanic it become incredibly complicated and unfriendly to new player soon after that blizzard release hearthstone the renown digital ccg which quickly get well deserve popularity as a casual and easy to get in f2p game but few year later hearthstone now come alongside with some issue mostly its rng base mechanic and debatable balance of some card come with new expansion and adventure so the story kinda repeat itself and hearthstone get more and more complicated and hard for a new player just like magic do at this point people that be hook in by hs start look for something else with less rng and more skill base or rather prediction base gameplay and here we be look at this beautiful game call eternal with great art style magic like mechanic and casual feeling of hearthstone the game be evenly interesting fun and complex summary the game be fresh and worth at least check it out beautiful graphic interesting mechanic but still casual enough to enjoy even small session of game,pos
in my opinon the best free to play game on the market i first find elsword on steam then download the game from the official website i have spend numerous hour on this game i have find that some part of the game become very repetitive play the game for too long without take a break cause me to get bored this be a game that i like to play for an hour or maybe a bit longer take a break go play another game then come back and play more overall i believe this be the good overall free to play game on the market,pos
first they come to our phone then they come to our computer at last they come to steam this game have make very little change and from the start it be almost a clicker game where you would have to click on the production room to gather the supply they make and for a phone game it can be understandable but not really okay by me the game would have be by far a well game if it be make more as a strategy game where power food and water be continously gather but always go up or down so if you be head towards too low you have to make a new room or find well people work that room rather than just risk set everything on fire and continue the clicker game basic where they start it be free so why not give it a try at good you will love the boring gameplay and eventually find the quest okay or at bad you will not play past day 1,neg
another poorly design iphone game port to pc after the first half hour of play you sit around and wait for something to happen then you get bored and frustrated so you gamble on rushing which use xcom rule to determine if you succeed i e if it say 40 chance to fail it be more like 90 when everything finally goesup include half your population the game wave it be microtransaction in your face remind you that real money will fix everything on top of that the good way to play the game be to not play it the game practically play itself and disaster only happen when you be micromanage slow boring frustrating and stupid basically another hamfisted cash in to sell microtransaction do not waste your time and especially do not waste your money,neg

once you get over the fact that this game be not in spirit a free to play it be one of the good hunting simulator in current day you have to buy a basic membership if you plan on enjoy this game so you have all license ammunition without either expire in hindsight the membership be actually cheap then your average mmorpg which charge you at average 15 a month thehunter only ask for 31 for the entire year or if you want extra stuff to work with 50 for the trailrunner and you can keep everything in the package even after it expire the animal do not interact with each other realistically like in deer hunter season 2005 but even with that the game be still extremely enjoyable especially in its multiplayer make new friend in this game be very easy and motivate you to hunt new specie explore more of the reserve and try out different way of hunting also this be not a run gun arena shooter game like call of duty so if you have the patience span of a gnat d ck you will hate this game so understand specifically that this be not a total free game but the asking price be not terrible either especially with the content that can be explore buy thing in the game be optional some thing you do need but can buy in pack duck hunt you do need the caller or you can not hunt duck camoflauge play a big deal in it too so if you plan on spend money in spot for different hunting then plan out where you will spend it without go broke manage your cash be all i can tell you so give thehunter a chance or if you be too broke then you will not be able to enjoy this game,pos

do you feel like play a game that do not involve micro transaction that give people the edge over you do you feel like fight in a fair fight that be not one sided every day do you feel like take off in your very own spaceship and fight the enemy and do you feel like get to know a certain set of weapon without fear they will get nerfe any day well what the be you still do here decide wether or not to get this game planetside 2 be 100 pay to win the team be not evenly match and the developer do nothing about it the spawn be not safe from team kill and blow up your brand spank new space ship that you can only spawn in every 10 20 min that s if you have the resource to spawn one the weapon be constantly nerfe and change make the game harder and harder to play let alone have any sort of fun the competition be go out of the game and for your own sake just look past this game and get star citizen or even a game that be 1000x well than this snake for the nokia 3310,neg
look i will admit i play more than my fair share and will continue to play i do not drop on real world cash on the game and for good reason gaijin entire monetary gain be base on your own frustration and bottleneck you to put money down you can play sure without spend any money that be what i do but the amount of time and effort you be go to expend it be go to be at least 2x that of a premium player and god forbid you want to try any vehicle that be premium base entire section of the game such as italian tank most lend lease capture vehicle certain camouflage etc be totally lock from player unless they drop real world cash on it or spend insane amount of time on wager which be extremely unreliable in themselves unlike most other game that these day encourage more sportsmanlike fighting gaijin be the exact opposite punish victim of teamkiller and rammer encourage spawn camp both way and moreover empower wallet warrior from throw coupon at you to point out every game here what you would get if you be premium to part fps re crewing grinding and more gaijen have largely by far create a game that do not extract money by trick you into lootboxes or loud showy sound or other psychological trick it be often pay with your wallet or patience i will not tell you to not play it because it can be fun i find it fun i really do but frankly if you want a dev that actually care about player feedback do not play this game if you want a game that be fully free to play do not play this game i could go on but this become a dead horse beat the fact of the matter be for the love of god do not give gaijin your money they do not need any more encouragement they really do not seriously it be to such a point that you can find statement from gaijjn employee that basically conflate player frustration grind with profit and if you be rich and you think this game be for you do not be fool even for the whale you will feel the sting of thing because notice how i have not say it be pay to win because it be not moreover it be pay to avoid spend excess time you can buy the most expensive thing in the game you could buy every last bit of content in the game with real world cash and ultimately it will not give you any increase in skill or anything you will still find yourself sucker punch in spawn by a guide rocket you will still find yourself be dove on by a chalka you will still get that single bullet hit you that split your aircraft in two so just play it do not play it just do not give gaijin more of your cash until they stop abuse the player base because really for those who actually shell out cash to this game it be always an abusive cycle of legitimate complaint introduce shiny new vehicle add more microtransaction legitimate complaint it be an abusive cycle and frankly it be only go to sour gaijin and the player base more as it repeat,neg

early access reviewcreativerse show so much potential though it be basically an ftp version of minecraft it be a lot more detailed and more fun than most minecraft copy that i have see the only problem that i can see be the fact that it be online only which i do not have a problem with personally but it do create a problem for those who travel a lot or those who do not have a very stable connection a few suggestion for playful be basically add in workshop support so that user can share their world and creation or at least add in support for server so that we do not always have to play with friend another thing you guy could add would be something like minecrafts creative mode for those who do not prefer survival and maybe a mode that add in hunger deletion of all item upon death and the need to sleep for those who enjoy a more hardcore play through all and all creativerse be a great game i definately recommend it to those who enjoy sandbox style game,pos

early access reviewi it fun yes be it worth money depend the game be an early access version of what will eventually be a free to play game with a tech tree similar to the like of war thunder or world of tank however it throw away the tier and instead balance all ship together into one matchmaking block similar to mechwarrior online it be enjoyable for a while but the grind begin to get excessive the good news be that you be not go to need to worry about repair or ammo cost which eliminate a point of stress in the grind the graphic be also absolutely beautiful unreal engine 4 be put to the max and boy do it look good the ship also be interestingly design the game have two mode a tdm style mode and a capture the base mode both be enjoyable but something like this could really use some more mode to keep its longevity and now onto the negative these mode will not keep your attention forever and you will quickly want more the various class of ship give a huge variety of playstyle but again you will be grind a while to get a ship you may or may not like unless of course you decide to throw money at premium currency in which case you can push to that ship faster and this be a bit of a problem unless you have snag the game on a free forever weekend you have already toss money at the game and now they be ask for more money via microtransaction this however be only a temporary problem since the game nee not be buy once it get release there also be major server issue despite there only be a peak of about 1000 player online in the world half the match i be in i will get severe lag stutter that be serverside not on my end final thought i would suggest you definitely get the game on one if its free forever weekend it will definitely net you enough enjoyment to be worth the download if you want to get the game with money i would also say it be probably worth it especially with the steam refund should you not like it will it be worth the microtransaction you decide,pos
only just start play but it be pretty fun the monster be cool and each have their own strength and weakness the ai be smart than a lot of game i have play and the art style be nice i will probably play some more,pos
this remind me of valve new artifact game everyone be excited for half life 3 but they get a crappy dota card game everyone be excited for elder scroll 6 but then we get this anyone else see the similarity it be not a bad card game though either,pos
the game its just addictive it have some positive and negative thing at least the game be just a perfect example of side screen game positive various character as elsword raven rena eve aisha ara lu ciel add elesis different class for every character every character have 3 different job lot of dungeon to play featured level 99 pvp be fun spar pvp training make you wast a lot of time with friend playing or chat a lot of nice costume suit etc for every character nice visual effect you can get all of pay for win item or costume by the money of the game ed negative take too much time to level up from level 50 all cool stuff its really expensive with ed money of the game and on real money the costume be expensive for real money a little bit of salty people if you pay you win more easy you probly do not want to know the price of the item on ed take too much time to get an amount of ed for buy something cool lag when a new thing be up event be a little poor but w e free stuff the game probly can have more point but the economy on the game to get a nice costume be a so that s why 8 10,pos
early access reviewcrache constantly early access or not the game in it be current state be just horrible too bad though it get a lot of potential so would advice people to wait till actual release to touch this game in anyway to avoid frustration,neg
early access reviewif you have not play this game yet go find a way to download it now it take what i love of super smash bros and give it a unique twist it be a great party game but it be as much fun climb through the ladder in rank this be a smash esque game where you actually want to have item on the lore be very well write i can really see this game be a big hit once it be open to everyone i would go into further detail describe all these point but i be sure many people have already do this in their review a couple suggestion though make the weapon pick up predictable there have be many time where i desperately want my hammer and i get an axe 2 3 time in a row i think change it so everytime you pick up a weapon it be guarnteed you will get the other weapon next time you pick up a weapon so essentially the weapon be on a rotation and you get that certain weapon every other time more gamemode in ffa i would love play brawlball stock and bombsketball with stranger i do not know how the matchmaking would work though maybe once the game be big the less desirable mode would not have that bad of a wait stance should be allow in matchmaking i have not see all of the stance so idk if some be ridiculously op be not but form what i have see they be balance out i be pretty sure there be really good reason why they be not in rank and what not but i think it would add an extra element to rank more of the daily mission i be sure you guy be go to add more mission but i just want to point out that i can not wait till that happen as a very casual player you could probably tell by my review thus far i like have goal to complete i would like them to be more advanced too idk what it will be but play as a certain character for 2 game in 1 day do not feel advanced enough maybe get a double kill as a certain character more thing to buy with coin do not get me wrong i do not want you to change any of the mammoth coin costing item into coin costing item i just want to be able to buy stuff with coin that be not character buy stuff with coin be a goal i work towards in game that keep me go as somebody that be consider buy the legend pack i be worried that i will not have anything to work up towards with coin maybe like profile picture or maybe you can unlock extra lore i do not need any of these suggestion in the game i be just brainstorm i would especially like for the weapon pick up not to be random though ever since pax i have be in love with this game and i can not wait to see what happen with it in the future thank for read d i hope this be helpful in any way,pos
at the time of this review i have not put much time into the steam release of this game i have play it a lot on my phone from the pc bethesda launcher and windows 10 store this game be really good it start off slow but get well the more you play it it be a much well game than i think it would be from look at the trailer gameplay footage it have optional micro transaction but be not pay to win over all the version of this game i have never put any money in and i have more than enough cap dweller nuka cola bottle and so on i be stockpile resource on every version because the game without put money in give you more than enough of each the game have a lot more depth than i originally though it would and now you can also leave the vault and go on quest i highly recommend give this game a serious try and put some time in with it if you be a fan of the fallout game you will understand thing a bit more but i can image even a non fallout gamer enjoy this game in my opinion this game work really well with a controller but be far well with keyboard and mouse it be free so check it out,pos
early access reviewi have try this game and it be actually great good thing about it it be similar to csgo with the keybinding and stuff rank system good aim and yea probably load of other good stuff bad thing when you buy the armor which give u 50 defense then buy 25 defense one you get the 25 defense one and lose 50 which should be fix imo u should either get 75 or a window appear say you already own this etc also when you die your weapon should drop and you have to re buy them from the shop make the game more challening and fun d although i know it be early access but still thank for me great game still,pos
early access reviewvery fun game if only more people play it i can not get in any game due to very few people be online at a time there a few lag spike here and there probably due to my internet,pos
early access reviewi play a lot of mtg as a kid then find hearthstone and love it but it eat so much money and the meta be always so stale and boring and deck building be so limited i be dissapointe after a while then i stumple upon eternal and it be really perfect generous to f2players and when you do spend money you get a lot of stuff for it this be my favorite game i return all the time,pos
as a player of smite since early beta i can definitely recommend this moba i find it be the good of its the good of its genre and have have hour and hour of fun with this game and with friend as the dev release new god it take a while before they balance them but eventually all the god in the game get balanced and ever single op god can get counter in some way whether its team composition playstyle or your character build this be hand down the most fun i have have with teamwork base game the community be good but with this now on steam i be not sure how that s go to change its only every so often you get troll on your team but if you be a more advanced player an easy fix be to play ranked match for the most competative experience most like feature gameplay game style the map be beautiful and the mechanic of movement and ability use be what make the game so distinct and fun most disliked feature loki isop you never see someone play bakasura unless its random pick and they get him this also go for a few other underrated godsoverall i find this game to be one of the good game for playability integrity and mutltiplayer if you be a scrub with no friend the game can still be enjoy 1 10 ign,pos
i really do enjoy this game for a long time and its a really good idea of a game but the game be become somewhat of a pay to win when you remove the ability to get a new class in a game that s enjoyabe because of its variaty of class and only make them obtainable through in game purchase ruin the experience of the game,neg
  i have around 80 hour in the game not nearly as many as other but i figure i would give the pov of someone that have never play the first planetside and be intrigued in play the second first off the developer of the game be superb they care about their playerbase they listen to feedback and they improve balance thing on a biweekly basis they recently have a huge optimization patch and i can say that i notice significant improvement to the game gameplay be apart of the game that i be not too particularly fond of but it can be fun if you find a group of people to play with solo play in a massive shooter like this will not be very rewarding unless you find a sweet spawn camp spot or somewhere that people be not hawk over to every 10 second i have find that with a group i have a more enjoyable time because i can get revive by friend and they can cover my back while play alone i have to watch my own back and sometimes random player that be play as a combat medic will not revive you for some reason user interface be always something i have to touch on as i be a ui designer myself for planetside 2 i feel they have do a great job refine the ui from what it be around beta release the attachment and certification system be much well than the original implementation and you can easily navigate through the ui to find what you be look for each of the icon on the bottom of the menu screen be precise in what they do so you be never fiddle around to figure out how to look at your weapon or view character progression or check out the station store each faction have different weapon that can be fully customize and have completely different high quality sound the weapon between each faction have different balance such as fast firing rate but less power or more power and less ammunition faction vehicle be also vastly different attribute that come into effect like speed firing rate rocket type etc all weapon and vehicle also have different camoflage color you can apply unique sound for all weapon and vehicle in the game really add to the immersion of be apart of the faction if you be vanu soverign your weapon be go to shoot little awesome laser beam that be for sure one thing that i feel be really lack in the game be the sense of community unless you be in a huge zerg squad you do not hear much communication over the voip and not many people talk in the chat mattherson server nc the community seem to really stick to their clan and do not really venture out to new player if you have question you may have to check the forum and even then if you post a question that be already answer you be in for some deep there be a lot of other aspect of the game that be great such as weapon vehicle customization instant action deployment resource system etc score gunplay 8 10gameplay 7 10monetization 6 10user interface 9 10customization 9 10sound design 10 10community 5 10,pos
early access reviewi really like the atmosphere and the ability to control large capital ship so overall a fantastic space shooter that i have be look for however two thing i find lack on a first impression and limited play first off in general i feel it be too fast from combat itself to the speed and destruction of the large capital ship and second the large capital ship seem really undergunned for such a large ship frigate corvette and destroyer style ship should be quick and manueverable with limited option for weapon sacrifice heavy weapon and armor for manueverability and speed where as the large cruiser battleship and carrier option should be much hard to kill and have an assortment of heavy weaponry at the severe cost to speed and manueverability of course i only play about an hour so i may be miss some of what the game have to offer this be just first impression,pos
  it may not be pretty but business tour be absolutely a work of art ign 10 10 masterpiece joke aside if you be look for a game to play with your friend from time to time and have fun this be your game p s it be pay2win and it have a lot of bug idc much about that tho,pos
a different level of moba where you have to skillshot your normal attack and most abillitie a different point of view where you can not see loki sneak behind you and different map game mode also kappa xd,pos
need some improvement to really be a high rate game what s good take apart and reassemble its not perfect the control be really wonky and instruction be not totally clear it be not always completely flexible either but still this part of the game be a lot of fun and as a gun owner it be fun to take apart the same gun i own in a game and see its interpretation of such what need improvement the shooting range it be god awful they could really borrow from arma 3 or aa for some more realisic shooting this feel like a cheesy arcade shooter and the recoil and ballistic be way off i realize that maybe its not to be take seriously but this game be go to invite gun nut like myself to play and when we go to the range portion its go to let us down i have to reaffirm these point because the game also presume to reach for your wallet at every turn want that next gun buy it with real money or grind exp for eternity want that other range yep pay up or grind its okay to ding around in with the free version for a bit but otherwise its not worth a long time play and if they want that much money they need that many improvement,neg
early access reviewlevel progress be not worth anything anymore as you get a box with random stuff whatsoever not worth build a high rank robot anymore or more than 1 or 2 functional one no garage x2 bonus no hero bonus no chance to forge what you want to have if you do not have a huge arsenal from bevore the update do not bother start play this,neg

the game be awesome when it start germans vs americans but it later go down the drain first there be the mighty german team but they be nerfe in a few month by some dev who think the americans should win before the nerfing i play around 460 hour but the nerf be the reason i quit i try to join later but they still want germany to lose this be the time the m1 g be buff and could one shoot at body shot with full hp at that time the player for germany be need the less damage upgrade to survive they then add russians whom at the start be destroy the buff americans and the nerfed germany at this time there be at most 80 germans play match then they nerfe america and the russian be buff later when i quit play and join back the iron sight of weapon such as svt gew m1 g kar mosin and m19 be nerfe the gun down sight be put further away and you could barely see where your reticle be after that the accuracy of semi bolt and rev weapon be nerfe so the rifle be become terrible a few day ago the game itself be have some player one shote people in the leg at full hp which i hope to hell the dev figure out but nothing have happen for a long while this be where i be now i notice they make the sound of foot movement quiter and the fully upgrade silent foot movement make no noise at all when walk so now you can not easily tell who be nearby even if you check map and right click the game be great starting but it be terrible near the end if i be to rate it at start it be 9 10 for everything but some map but now i rate it 2 10 for the terrible condition that be now in effect the graphic and map be well at the cost of the experience i would suggest play well ww2 game now but if you have a time machine go to the time the game be start because it be well then than it be now edit 1 also even if you do not have or do have a good pc the game will compensate by slow down the well pc game so the other terrible computer can catch up an example be when say you get in a gun fight your game may glitch out and a hint be you do not shoot where you aim when this happen so you be go to die i find out that there be no counter measure for spawnkilling so be careful or leave the terrible match btw i would suggest level all the country up at the same time cause if you get to gold level and you want to start a new character for a different country your new weak character be still put in top tier gold match so you end up get screw most of the time by mg sniper with sidearm or tank which you can not do anything to at the moment edit 2 spawn point for the assault map be terrible some of the map i suggest not play be mountain town town and forward airfield the terrible skirmish map be hill 60 and village skirmish both encounter map be great but once the battle be near an end the spawnkilling be unbearable important note when you die or use your gun you lose credit so try not be on a lose map say when someone pick your gun up you still lose credit for the use of that gun germany be know for well late game weapon tanks america be know for well rate of fire plane and russia be know for well damage infantry by the way the soldier skin be not share with each one and germany skin be more expensive than both america and russia german green pea can cost 790k for body and 107k for helmet american nagual can cost 352k for body and 97k for helmet russian palma cost 352k for body and 97k for helmet if you want cheap clothing go for america which at the least cost 30k for dark green body and 13k for dark green paint helmet or dark green cloth helmet which cost 35k america have the good tanker gun germans have the good recon gun and russians have the good infantry mg gun,neg

early access reviewfun for a quick jump scare quite a long game for a completely free to play game it start off cutesy but soon get dark in lighting and tone 7 10review spookys house of jump scare be a fairly fun horror game it start with a rather cute look ghost spooky tell you to traverse the room of the mansion along the way you will see cute cardboard cutout of octopus and ghost as you get further into the mansion you will meet other monster that will chase in a less jump scary fashion such as a slime monster or a ghost girl the only real downfall this game have be that it be rather repetitive as it be jump scare after a short while they lose their edge and scariness so you just end up speed through each room and majority of the monster be just slow chaser so you can just outrun them it do have some different section amidst the repetitive ness such as a space like section a rusty school section etc it be mainly a shame that after room 760 there be nothing new for now as the developer have a message pop up state that from then on it be incomplete,pos

planetside 1 hold the crown of the first truly massively multiplayer shooter for a long while until dust 514 come out but now the reign champion be back better than ever sort of the scale be indeed massive and the core mechanic work well but the feature list be not quite as long as it be predecessor that be not necessarily a bad thing but there be an unsteady balance between performance feature and quality when the team focus on one the other suffer give that it be all about pvp the difficulty curve can be unforgiving at first but the variety in combat scenario and the smooth flow from one battle to another make this game worth the effort,pos

its okay but not great that s just it it have so much potential as a free to play game but you can not play free unless you be in a clan tradeing be limited and thus so be your ability to play free you can not buy krono if you be a free player and you can not sell thing on the auctionhouse to get the plat for krono if you can see past limitation and want a good game to explore this game be for you the craft system be a nice feature though the sound may put you to sleep as it be very relaxing overall the game be more of a 7 10 for what it have to offer but bear in mind that you can expect some pretty steep limitation if you just want to play free update i do not know what the hell happen but the game be now riddled with bug you be officially well off play runescape,neg
  2000 hour play before switch to steam good game with a lot of potential but ruin by terrible developer who only care about monetize one more and more feature that should be free2play instead of listen to the communitys feedback they choose to belittle us and avert their eye from the problem i have be play the game since 2014 with 500 spend but after the recent controversy i will no longer support this company,neg
early access reviewamazing game so far only one thing i dislike about solo be that when you kill an enemy they become a chicken in which they can run away and get self revive after a time limit of course like come on dude i already kill this guy why do i have to kill him in chicken form to get his stuff it just waste time i like the idea of unique class and ability and that other class can not use a different class ability also that in order to get lengendary item class weapon ability you have to go to a forge there be multiple forge on map in which can end up be a bloodbath because everone will want to go to the forge to craft stuff how do you craft stuff you collect shard by destroy duplicate or basically every weapon armor ability drop by other player in other word i already love this game and only have like 48 minute on it this be my dream game i have always want a medieval battle royale or at least something close to it this be fantasy battle royale there be still gun but they be like musket,pos
early access reviewas you can see i have not play much of this game i have play aq and aqworld think and most of their other game this be kind of like aq but i could see it be go to be way grindier then aq and that s say something but with the same type of art style but well 3d it have a similar style to aqworld thought because it have the attack and 4 abuiltie but the ui be set up for touch screen so its really accuard to play honestly i would agree with most people right now that its not really ready to be play yet unless you be really want to grind heavly,neg

early access reviewthis game be outstanding basically its a free version of super smash bros i recommend this game to anyone who be look for a indie action fighting game i play this game every day this game be amazing one of the good platformer for low spec pc,pos
an acceptable way to spend your time if you be look for an mmo that be not wow but not worth play if you be not plan on subscribe the f2p model be atrocious especially for return player restrict content be tremendously overpriced it be cheap to just buy a subscription the poor handling of the f2p transition be really unfortunate since the game have retain a lot of charm over the year and still have some of the cool player housing available consider this a trial version and not a true free to play game,pos
early access reviewit a lot of grind for nearly no reward seriously and even the grinfing be slow its not like in aqw where you can quickly grind the 500 type of mob need here its 1 mob 1 2 minute i get this game on alpha and seriously there be nothing to do its just a sense of progression no real end goal you kill inocent monster after inocent monster call yourself a hero and that s it,neg
  art style fit dark and realistic theme perfectly graphic be also technically great without performance issue huge passive skill tree which lead to unlimited different playstyle gem base skill system allow you to try different setup anytime you want combat be not much different from other arpg but it work damage hp mana balance be pretty good level design be ok game lenght be nice for player who seek a good campaign and the good everything above be completely free not a single balance destroy microtransaction so there be almost nothing to complain,pos

hand down one of the good arpg title i have ever have the pleasure to play and i do not have to pay a dime do not stop me from do so as the cosmetic be awesome and often time come down in price during big holiday and season base sale the game itself feature one of the more robust skill creation system i have ever have the pleasure of play with and likely be no where near do make new way to let player battle foe the gear be solid and the grind be not too bad up to what be consider the end game there be always a strong fight wait for you around the corner as well the music i have to talk about the music some of the good stuff out there right now with boss fight be wonderful and several area have the grim dark and creepy music you would expect from a game such as this but even the more sacred track such as the crypt aka church dungeon see love even though its a side area and man i could sit there for hour listen,pos

early access reviewok the game do have it flaw but that do not mean the game be bad it be exceedingly mediocre not the good mmo i have play certainly not the bad my opinion graphic i think they be very good the scale of thing be right on the tree be nice as well 8 5 out of 10gameplay mix emotion here some of the skill be confuse combat be fast than other mmo 6 out of 10 translation need some serious work here 3 out of 10overall have it postive and negative 6 out of 10not as bad as some make it out but certianly do not hit the mark besides trasnlation and stuff animation customization bug make some people give it really awful review it be early release so hopefully they can fix and get ther act together,pos
  please give this a read so i have just take a peek at the review for this game to see if other have be enjoy it as much as i have and i be shock with all the negative there be a lot of the negative response i see be complaint on the fact that the game itself be not really free to play or that it be pay to win but you be play the full game you be just limited to what you can hunt which be mule deer now that do not sound like a whole lot and it really be not in comparison to what else the game have to offer but i spend a solid 3 hour straight tracking and hunt mule deer and have a blast i quickly realize that this game be well worth shell out some money for the terrain be gorgeous the way all of the animal behave be very realistic the tracking keep me very interested in the hunt and the overall experience be just amazing to those of you who be look for a free hunting game with lot of gun and animal to shoot i be sorry to disappoint you but this be not it the free part be just a demo really of the full game where you can hunt mule deer and get that taste but if you be look for a great hunting game and be willing to drop 30 40 buck on a bundle that give you 12 month of unlimited hunting a 12 gauge shotgun come with all different type of shot to hunt everything a new strong rifle with a new scope a 44 and 357 revolver some well camod clothe some call and a few other goody then this be definitely the game for you seriously if you enjoy the experience of just hunt the mule deer for a bit drop some money into it and go for the full experience it be really worth it this game deserve to be pay for 9 10 only because of microtransaction with all the rest of the item that do not come in a bundle but none of that other stuff be actual stuff that be need to enjoy the game and have the full experience,pos
before i play lafter i play 7,pos
early access reviewthis game be really well make very fun and offer an intense and spooky experience this game be great one of my fave game i have play recently i be so glad i hear about it and get to play it it say i only have 3 hour on record but i convince a friend to download it and i play the whole thing in one sit we all agree the style be great and be a game that should be try please play this fun and spooky unheard of until now,pos
i do not know what tf be go on i love it chaos everywhere this be a game engineer for my specie for sure hahaha there be always like 2 purple guy and 200 red and blue hahaha they loose their territory in no time sadly all those guy who pay be op and also it be cool on the beta where everything be affordable no it take 3 decade of grind to get an underpowered gun damn 7 10 yeah you hear me,pos
never get into arpg like diablo have not play a game like it there be quite the learning barrier when you first start up but thank god the internet exist overall it be enjoyable slashing and hack and use frost blading in a cone like projectile shoot and use a ghostly totem to wack those boss and mob i like it remind me of warframe when it be intense defense 50 round no stop,pos
this game deserve more recognition it be just insanely good and the developer seem to care about it so far also the amount of stuff they give away for free be insane it be not for everyone since it be a moba and it be hard to learn to play but if you will get past the initial beating you will find in this game a very good game,pos
early access reviewearly impression be wonderful custom game be even more enjoyable than the matchmaking rank seem to be really tactical in 2v2s only thing i hope to see in the future be large map each legend feel fairly balanced and can be counter with a few changed tactic i highly suggest gather friend up for nonsense hope to see brawlball get it be own queue at some point 3v3 brawlball would be pretty amazing worth a download if you enjoy smash bros or castle crasher,pos
i have try lol dota and a few other mobas but i just could not get into the isometric click fest after have play the beta i give smite another shot when it launch 1 5 year ago and i never look back more than a 1000 hrs later i be still play every single day it will take you some time and practice to get use to it all but it be more accessible compare to other mobas due to it have less item and be able to turn on auto buy level positioning be a big part of be successful as well as aim timing communication and synergy make it hard to master the game be base on mythology from 7 different pantheon and the 69 god at the time of writing all have lore relate direct taunt which add a lot of humour to the mix 5 different class 8 game mode on 5 different map offer something to enjoy for everyone regular update and patch keep the game fresh with plenty of free gem event and sale you will not need to spend tonne of cash on cosmetic if you do not want to i have accumulate 1000s of gem and free stuff in my playtime be the 3rd big moba with 2nd large tournament prizepool in e sport history i think i can safely say hi rez finally hit the right spot with this game the only negative thing i can think of be that on a rare occasion the server lag and sometimes matchmaking can be a bit wonky which be not too big of a deal if you do not play ranked league as with any online game you get a few toxic player every now and then but they can easily be mute or ignore and more often than not you will find nice and reasonable folk in your match furthermore i can reccommend play queueing with friend once you get use to the 3rd person and aim turn off auto buy level and use site like tiermonster com for item build the bot in co op game mode be horribly bad get into pvp as soon as possible read some guide and watch stream to improve your game if you enjoy the game get the ultimate god pack unlock all god future god it be the good deal in moba games vvgl good luck vvgf have fun 9 10 would kappa again,pos
early access reviewto be honest i be love the gameplay so much i be put off at first by the optimization use unreal engine it require me to read a reddit fix for the ini file and tweak some stuff but once i get over 30 fps finally i grow to love the game combat be well than expect and this be refreshing from bdo less grindy more quest and exploration pvp orient kinda about the jourey idk i be just have fun i bash it the first day along with everyone else but it be a decent game but they must fix the optimization issue quickly yesterday it actually remind me of when i first play wow the sense of awe i get from explore the scenery in this game,pos
its boring i know its try to be relalistic but you walk at a snail pace and barely see anything special it all look the same so if you want to wait for ever for a second of action this be your game but its not for me i be pationt but this game get on my nerve but hey its free cough micro transaction cough,neg
every time i try and log on it take me to the charecter creation screen and its a good and bad good because i can make a new charecter for free and get new dragon and bad because it do it every time i log off or try to switch charecter then the loading time it take take way to long for me to enjoy the game,neg
after take a look at the negative review on this game regard it say f2p when they have a guest user system which be essentially their version of free user i do not see why you be all upset about this the system work perfectly with the game and despite many of you say you have to invest lot of cash to actually do anything you would be supprised if you take a look around their starter pack page and various retailer for the game key website amazon etc you can infact find ridiculously good deal for this title i will explain that further on i myself find the game to be one of the good hunting simulator i have play in a long long time the cabelas series honestly have be blow away by this title and the community as it stand be in excellent condition the game be regularly update and despite have a few issue in the past it be turn out to be one of my all time favourite game due to the fact that there be an unlimited amount of fun that you can have from have hunting competition with your friend to solo hunting in the dense forest or in the mountain peak the graphic and the game ballistic physics be clean and very well do despite have hiccup rarely with a few glitch they need to iron out you would be supprised at how much you can actually achieve within the game the achievement and reward system for competition and general milestone be another feature which add a sense of achievement to invest your hour into the game same with weapon skill and track spot skill level on to the weapon currency and customization within the game customization be somewhat limited due to the fact you can not swap camo on your weapon so the marketplace often have weapon of the same type but a different appearance but it do not really matter as they share the same skill stat aslong as they be the same model character appearance be another feature you can customize within the game by simply mix and match clothing to your desire with the wide range available it be really not that bad as well as you can swap out clothing on different enviroment condition or depend on what you be hunt to give well visibility and sound reduction stat currency em gm within the game be something you would definetly expect for a game of this type with a large multiplayer endorsement around the game i would not have expect anything less than the requirement to buy different weapon clothing and equiptment with the virtual currency which be perfectly understandable for this title and be implement well within the game em be the real world exchange currency where you purchase it use real world money or you can complete survey as an additional way of gain it for those who can not justify support the title through currency purchase gm be the free currency which you can gain through suveys again or by complete challenge or competition within the game however you can purchase limited thing use this currency honestly despite what you guy be say they should have no shame in call themselves a f2p game i have spend many hour within this game and spend what i would say be a fairly reasonable amount on addition for the game they offer a nice range of deal on their site for starter pack for the price of 15 you can get almost everything you would need to have a nice start to the game the 12 ga pump action shotgun include can hunt almost everything within the game you gain 3 month membership and access to hunt everything and travel anywhere as well as various other equiptment and a sidearm include i do not realise it before but i find various retail version of the game available on certain retailer website and despite already have a membership and a nice collection of weapon i go ahead and spend 14 on a retail key from link remove who offer a very nice retail package for this for the price of any regular game so what be the shame in call this an f2p game if they give you a variety of free option and then the ability to upgrade to a full version of the game with a membership starter pack retail copy for the price of any regular game it be perfectly justified and for those who be interested in that retail copy it be beyond belief what you get from it and i would highly recommend that to anyone interested in start or continue play this game it include 6 month membership 7 weapon 2 shotgun 2 sidearm 2 rifle 1 bow as well as access to everything within the game and another large assortment of equiptment and caller to get you start note one of the shotgun be an exclusive non market shotgun too weapon in the game be definetly very fitting for the title the developer have keep far away from unrealistic hunting weapon despite firearm such as ar 15s and semi automatic rifle be use regularly in real world hunting they have take the right desicion to not spoil the fun of hunt and keep it to a nice selection of rifle shotgun sidearm and bow they even add a muzzleloader for those who want a way back hunt expirence perfect match for a perfect game overall in my opinion the game be absolutely superb with it be stunning graphic unbeatable realistic physic and it be very well implement multiplayer community and feature definetly a 10 10 in my book and for those upset about the pricing of thing seriously check out the retail copy and the starter pack for the price of a regular game under 15 you can get everything you need to have endless hour of fun within the game hopefully this be helpful if not then i be not sure what you be expect from a review note over 100 hour on the non steam version felix b,pos
sure its just a clicker idler but the content be actually really well put together its not ptw or ptp you can grind it out or spend money if you would rather i run it in the background mostly but enjoy the collection of character and odd mission,pos

pro good if u into oldschool yugioh playstyle no xyz pendulum syncro and otherstuff yet con lazyporte this whole software still design for mobile there be even no max windows button literally you could call this emulator not a pc version harder than dark soul because i get auto lose for almost every ranked or kc duel because some of connection problem while i have decent and stable connection and in term of game u only get 3 field for monster spell trap card instead of 5 dw seem useless for me why you bother duel ai who can not fight back stage quest would be good too if we do not have to duel many pointless battle even with auto dueling prefer to duel 2 3 game against good ai than many game with auto duel like thatwell can not complaint more since its free to play and i do not really mind about micro selling in free game would recommend if atleast technical problem get solve and have pc friendly user interface,neg

i do not expect much from mobile version of really enjoyable game but to be honest i never think it will be this bad and i do not mean graphic and stuff here 7vs7 battle do not feel really exciting map be way too small to enjoy even 10 of original pc version of world of tank almost every battle do not even last 2 3 minute and it be not only low tier thing also have no arty be not a good thing but i know it would be too hard to pull on mobile game there be no trace of tactic leave i really want to play it for much longer but sadly i will not i do not really understand the reason why mobile port make it on steam not the normal version too scared of war thunder have some kind of competition be always great but world of tank blitz will probably make only people stay away from wargaming game,neg

early access reviewremember that time when you be play a game and think that this game need a lot more mindless action and fighting so now you have it and you do not even need to pay for it review legend the legend have repetitive weapon but each one of them have their own unique skill with them but unfortunally there as always those guy spamme spear rotation to not let you get back in the arena the legend be completly free o money you just need to play a lot to buy the one you want the game have a weekly rotation of legend so you can play with em all without even buy them arena the arena be kinda simple with some of them that actually have some feature or other the game itself get kinda of 7 8 arena but they all could get an upgrade and new feature all the arena be spear spamme friendly but with the right momentum you can just tell the sheethead to go away with a punch in his head skin the game give you the oportunity to have all the legend with only play the game but the skin just with mammoth coin translate real cash i kinda think this be good because you will only buy the one you like for the one you play but there should be another way to get them not like csgo with crate and sheet but kinda a presential month list that if you get all day ingame you could trade for a skin buuuut that s just me gameplay consist of the couch the single player the online and the rank the cool part of them all be not that you just play by yourself this game bring back the good old same screen co op gameplay meaning you can add more than 1 player in one pc for me this be actually awesome the game consist in kill everybody else in the arena be it in team or f4a free for all all legend have 2 weapon and can still just brawl their brain out with their fist end for all of you whom be reluctant to play this i shall tell you let freaking explode their brain with freak massive rocket spear 9 5 10,pos

early access reviewbrawlhalla be a great smash platform remake it be very fun to play with many people and have great strategic gameplay however the gameplay itself be the bad kind imagineable its server be probably the bad i have play on ever i ve explore to see if this be come from my home internet connection but it be actually come from the direct server themselves every single game i have play lag immensly and be sometimes unbearable there need to be a massive update for multiplayer and server performance,pos

early access reviewthis be my first steam review and it be for a great game if you be look for a game to scratch that magic itch before arena come out look no further develop by some top mtg pro lsv chapin and it definitely show come from magic i love the combat and the power influence system there be thing in this game that could not be do with a paper card game like persistent effect in the void graveyard buffing card in your deck before draw them and steal unit end up in your void there be less opportunite to respond to action than magic but more than hs and it keep game move quickly it be definitely the most f2p ccg out there the game practically throw pack and gold at you if you keep up with quest and event they often have event in game that you break even in term of gold value without put up a stellar performance i have spend 25 on this game but it be only be for cosmetic item i do not even need to spend the gem real currency because i have more than enough gold and shiftstone craft currency to do what i want to do at the time of this review there be 3 set out and 2 campaign which be already a pretty good card pool with more on the horizon the development team of direwolf digital be great with their interaction with the community the initial tutorial be a bit long but they give you a nice stash of gold and base card to start with there be two ai mode that give pretty good reward one be a forge a draft lite experience you pick one of three card option and then be present with 3 more card and so on until you have a deck you keep all card from draft and forge no phantom draft here the other ai format be gauntlet where you play a deck of your choice through a gauntlet of ai deck with one loss end the run at the end of the run you fight a boss deck that have a specific gimmick that may benefit or hurt both player i e both player start with 3 power when you play a unit play a random weapon on it etc whenever i get burn out play pvp i like to reset with a gauntlet or forge run,pos
good computer base cardgame to date this be what hs want to be before it degenerate down to a simple rng feast most game in tesl be very intense and the comeback mechanism with rune be just pure genious the fact you can actually grind together deck that be quite competitive in a week be just ice on a very good cake,pos

so i have unintentionally play this for 5 hour today yes it be like minecraft but it be well in just about every way imaginable the craft system be well the tool system be well the movement system be well the sound be way well the only thing i find that be not well be the constant reminder to upgrade to pro that be pretty annoying it be a big advertisement i expect i eventually will get pro because unlike minecraft i expect this game will go on sale at some point also 20 be a pretty decent price i would like to hear some more review on the pro aspect before spend the money though for now it be a very fun free to play minecraft2,pos
even with the limitation of time and game engine i still find this to be fun my favorite class be the gunslinger which just so happen to have a great skillset for new player hence why they be a starter class this game diversity be unique from other and that be what i like about it,pos

the idea be great and truly unique but the execution be just so poor in this game app all you do be click and each time you do that you have to wait through a rather slow animation which also affect the camera which be annoying model be fairly detailed but low poly and they just look bad everything take forever not only progression and get new gun but also the process of strip the gun itself there be stupid bug like press the mag release will for some reason not release the magazine you have to click the bottom of the mag to take it out there be no physical fire mode switch you have to click a hover button to use that function additionally while strip gun you have to follow a non realistic path that the game force on you overall it be a nice idea but the game itself suck,neg
early access reviewthis game be break when you have a flak you be op and when you be a low level you need to play so much game to finally get something good that be worth something when i open crate i get the cosmetic stuff that when i buy it it be worth 20k but when i sell it i only get 8 that be not right in my head i like the game a while ago so please make it like the old one or fix these problem,neg

world of tank blitz the smash hit mmo tank game have take the mobile world at storm now before you make assumption about wotb its graphic be good but however with every good game come its up and down wotb with a bad wifi connection can reach up to 2455 ping which be exeptionally high not a good thing since that make the game respond much slow to your command at a time delay of around 2 6 second and that may not seem a lot but low ping be crucial espeacially when there be high tier in the match wotb consist of 2 team and 7 player each team the ussr and other country country which be currentley include in the game be ussr united states of america japan nazi period germany up to tier 9 in the medium tier anyway britain and other premium tank like the angry connor a scottish tank tank type tank destroyer a type of tank that do good damage but many be turretless heavy tank a type of tank that have great armour and can take a beat medium tank faster than heavy but weak damage and less armour but have fast reload speed light tank fast mobile and weak armour serve as a scout car summary at the end i would definetley reccomend this game and please like it if you do it really help,pos

early access reviewi think people be highly go overboard with the negative review the game still in early access still be add to and adjust and some how in 1 2 day people think they know everything about it and that its problem will never get fix firstly i must say out of all the early access game i have play in the last few year this have be one of the well one if not the good only one or two maitenance on the first night no real massive downtime on the first day roughly about 2 hour all in all it be down for on the first night for maitenance so i think its do fine the game itself be quite fun there s a bunch of thing to do nothing that have not be do before but still a variety and it do not feel like a massive chore the combat be fun for a tab target game the combo system make it interesting i prefer this kind of combat to pure action combat because its not a a buttonmash fest and you have to think about what your use and how to utilise the stance to get the most of possible the problem atm be quite normal for any recently release mmo and i can deal with that it will get well with time only problem i have which be just a preference be that some class i want to play be not out mostly assassin but that s not much of a problem ill just get familiar with the game till its out another issue i would like to pick up on though this fail in other region and be a old game accord to some its be tweak quite a bit for us and they keep on tweak it just have patience i still feel like it have promise and i hope people give it a go because neowiz be actually really try as a company to live up to what people here want which be suprising since i can not think of many company who would actually go to the length they do to make this build of the game for us it be similar but at the same time very different to the other build it have in other region i hope it have a steady success and help people remember what mmo be for to have fun and enjoy the adventure be it pvp pve or other,pos
first of all i would like to say that while there be certainly those who be more qualified than me to judge this game i feel i have play it enough and over a long enough time span to write an accurate review and yes i only get it on steam so i could review it mean that i have play for quite a bit long than 0 2 hour use the browser version next i give this a very tentative recommendation since this game be great for some and hell for other now for the actual review,pos
early access reviewi really enjoy this game i spend entirely too many hour play this game over the past few year and i truly love it one of the thing that make such an amazing multiplayer game like this be a healthy relationship between the developer and their community freejam recognize this clearly because in the introduction to their product they make the claim robocraft have be build with a dedicated community of robocrafter from the very beginning unfortunately it seem like they recently replace someone within their company that have absolutely no respect for their community or have no desire to retain their exist player i be already extraordinarily upset when they remove megabot that be a big deal to me because i have 4 custom megabot which i spend countless hour build they be the game to me when freejam remove them read delete overnight i be shock after a week or so i get over it and rebuild some bot and resume play albeit a bit more reserved this late update take my disdain for change to another degree and completely remove my currency entirely both of them i have over 200 million rp and now it be go i have 20 worth of their premium currency save go my compensation for this loss be a crate which have some white block in it no apology no word of solace or anything which may remotely comfort me and bad of all no explanation in game the fact be these people have no regard for their community whatsover they further have no regard for their time or effort they simply do not care plain and simple they care about one thing money more specifically yours the individual reading this review debate about whether or not they should install it and give it a shot go for it install it love it build your dream robot and have a great time it be a really fun game unfortunately for me and thousand of other by the look of it i be do i have spend far to many hour only to have my effort toss aside with zero regard no consideration for their exist player i quit,neg
take the same mechanic from other game like clicker hero and add some wonky battle formation mechanic which ultimately do not matter that much because it be an idle game all individual eventually just turn into a dps bucket of damage over time so you be just leave with a clunky interface need a lot of ui slimming quest be not meaningful they be just some text and a kill so many x or collect so many y which be not functionally any different than just kill a set number of enemy every level,neg
product receive for freeearly access reviewthis game be a really nice twist on the moba genre i personally do not like mobas but with this twist it work really well i have see the development change and evolve and the developer be work hard to make the game great and improve their product definitely reccomend,pos
its a grate time killer i get so scared after 4 hour of try to find something a bear come up to me like hi its not a scary game but when its so peacefull u do not expect anything to pop up p,pos
  note my playtime on steam do not reflect the many hour i play on my phone so i see a lot of negative review on the game and i do understand where they be come from but to be fair this be originally a mobile game and most of the problem that be pointend out come from the fact that it be a mobile game to get straight to the point do i recommend hell yeah if your a fallout fan and hungry for some extra fallout content definately go for it its even free and really by all mean try it out cause its not a bad game at all if you have play mobile game before you will aprreciate that it be one of the gem in astorm that be the google play store for a more detailed overview here be the pro conspro its fallout decent vault managing content nicley polished fallout style graphic lot of loot and equipment not a pay to win con quest line can become repetitive quick no strong story line or dialogue tread in grey area difficulty drop pretty fast can take long to perform upgrade or craft now with all of the above be say i would like to point out that some of the con be quite inevitable for a mobile game no strong story line or decision make dialouge for this i have to say i do agree that life or death decide moral decision will spice up the game a lot but you have to take into account that this be f2p people spend cash to get there rare equipment or dweller imagine thestorm the dev will have to go through confront angry player who have there cash item disappear to an ingame event the main fallout game can give you difficulat decision cause you have a savegame to fall back too plus if you up you can always start a new game with out have to pay extra for anything can take long to perform upgrade or craft its a mobile game guy people who play mobile game usually do not spend hour to play a game in one sit they usally play while on break while they go home during lunch etc the hour do not matter to much because they spend most of that wait time to do what they do plus the game be not a public service the dev need money to create new content upgrade speed boost be a good way for them to monetize the game you can hate on microtransaction all you want but this game have one of the more reasonable microtransaction scheme i have see in year for a mobile game plus for fallout shelter the pay be really just for time reduction there be no pvp element so your not missingout on anything even if you do not pay quest line can become repetitive quick difficulty drop pretty fast these two i actually have to admit be probably the big flaw of this game even consider the fact the dev can not really throw you difficult decision the questline available be very bland just to be fair i think the dev decide to add the quest content as an afterthought because it dindt exist at launch for the difficulty it get really easy pretty quick the raider death claws roach become easy to repel soon enough and serve nothing much than a minor annoyance in the later game occasionally fire may breakout in the vault but that be also a minor issue until the dev introduce some new threat and new building after you build up your vault 100 dweller it will get repetitive that s pretty much all i have to say about this game it have a fair share of flaw but if your a fallout fan its deffinately worth check out it may serve as a good filler in between your long journey in the mohave and capital wasteland 8 10 will send dweller out again for population control,pos
my h play say everything about this game enjoyedit i change my mind i m not support this game anymore cuz his abusive moderator they have in the forum they delete every post they personaly do not like it so until dev of this game teach and keep in leash some mod i l not play support anymore this game support money,neg
early access review generous in term of card acquisition marvelous deckbuilding in term of design and creativity it can allow broken combo and you need a lot of expensive card sometimes but quite cool in the game you can have up to 4 copy of each card per deck still i say it be really free to play automacic mulligan you can keep it or draw a full new hand a little frustrating and not in your hand resource mechanic sigil a k a as mana land etc in other game be kinda broken magic style not horrible but somehow annoying you can have 8 resource card and nothing to play or the opposite easily it be early access but it be a desing flaw they should fix the only signigicant flaw i can notice be the same as before where build a deck be certainly a very fun and interesing experience play it be not a lot more than click avaiable card for your turn and keep a couple of reactive spell in hand i learn quite a bit about deep mechanic and the game have a lot a lot of super powerful combo wich make even big the feeling of only one person destroy the other either you or your opponent this make the resource system somehow not that big of a problem but still frustrating sometimes still it be worth a try in my opinion but keep in mind deckbuilding be very deep and fun and actualy play be as hard as say the alphabet it have a gaunlet mode wich be like a versus ia arena you can enter for free and earn some card and gold so i would recommend try it a little bit,pos
well i have to be honest and i do not think i have ever write such an entirely negative review if you pay attention to a lot of aspect of this game you realise that the developer probably do not care very much i know this sound harsh but i will explain why i think this the game itself be entirely generic to be honest you go into town and get gun and food you try not to die to player and zombie issue with the way the game work melee weapon be all the same range despite their model brass knuckle to polearm like weapon they all have the same range not to mention some of the model be entirely break the shiv be entirely invisible with no model at all as well as one of the other weapon entirely lose it be tip when it be jab at thing melee weapon have one attribute damage that be the only thing to them other than look and i be fairly certain they all attack at the same speed not to mention the very good melee weapon you can get do not work propperly and will miss the opponent often enough that it be not usable at all see as you will take damage use it because enemy will not be stun by your hit skill tree not only do this skill tree only have a handful of skill they be entirely generic if you be look for a unique character compare to other people character you will not have any luck that be not even the end of it if you want to be a melee base character prepare to also be force to invest point into sniper base trait not to mention these benefit be so tiny that you will not notice them you will also question if they even code it correctly and the trait work in the first place as they do not tell you by how much they will increase your ability path 2 survivalist which make you not need to eat as often or drink as often which without the perk you will never have a problem with ever you will not even have to pay attention to your food and water value even after play for hour on end path 3 health and stamina increase path path 4 super expensive exp wise give you pretty sizable increase to damage and double stamina etc point be do not expect anything special silly random thing like a wooden baracade make a c4 explosion sound when it break and alert everyone in the area of your presence despite all this i do have some fun play it it be free and i have a lot of laugh with my friend at all the glitch like have to jump over a curb because you can not step over it during an intense zombie chase the one thing that i really like about the game be that they have ton of gun i have honestly never see a game with so many gun do i think this game could ever become more than it be now no to be honest it be a very generic premise i do not want to see another game with such low effort conceptually i know it be a free game but they be obviously make a lot of money off of this since this be their second itteration of the game which they do not change barely anything between the game seriously i have play both it be the same game map be the same zombie model almost everything not an exaggeration it just boast slightly improve graphic to the developer please find someone with an imagination you do not have it i give the game 1 10 ps survival mode be a complete mess where you will not see food or water spawn and you can not drink out of the large body of water no special skill tree for survival expect to see 40 gun or melee weapon before see a single food or water item survival just be not a fun experience because it be balance poorly,neg
it be a must have game unique in many way and extremely enjoyable also feature trading which be way big than you may expect be sure to give tf2 a try edit i proudly nominate team fortress 2 for the test of time 2016 and labor of love 2017 and 2018 steam award,pos
i honestly would reccomend the game if the sound would not glitch so much i run on a pretty good gaming computer but upon download the audio script music be miss however great game but do not live to my expectation,neg
it have a learn curve but its a good game with big battle so make sure you twek your setting if you do get into this game then this game could use your help to get even well for me this game be worth finacal support have a good day,pos
you know i love this game but damn hi rez stop release new content and fix what be already here the game be in need of serious balancing and its make me not wanna play because i can not leave the meta,neg
after 16 year of mmo gaming this have be the most innovative and fun game i have play i be an old school mmorpg player and also a long time reader of the book of forget realm and this game have keep to what the actual world its set in have be portray as in the book which be rare the combat be more than just click and go you have the ability to completely dodge an attack and that make this game require some actual skill which only a few mmorpg have it give a sense of challenge and do not empower those who spend money to a point in which a person who do not can not compete with them very fun and a very friendly atmosphere i give this game a 10 10 in all point give this a try if you enjoy game where you can be uber without year of grinding or dungeon run and enjoy a game that be completely playable solo see you ingame,pos
probably one of the big and good team base fps on the f2p market the good part be that you do not need to spend any cash to remain competetive lot of gun tank and explosion,pos
when i hear last year there be go to be a card game for elder scroll i think it be go to be lame but then 6 month ago i decide to download it and play it and figure ill give it a chance i be really suprised about how good it be and i never like hearthstone but this game surprise me i think its a well version of heathstone for everyone who ask if its p2w or not i have be play for a long time now and ill tell you right now it be not you can get a lot of good card in the game without pay a only thing you will pay for be story or if you do not have patience and want shortcut you can buy card pack and see if you get lucky,pos
i really love these type of game i have play a lot and i feel i could easily sink a few hundred hour into this title pro great class cool graphic easy to get into but with layer of complexity build in with formation strategy and place toon in just the right spot and it be great that it play even if you log off so you be always make progress con very very addictive i be really glad they add the game to steam because i think it be great,pos
it be ok the fact that there be perma death be cool but it kinda suck when you have 200 thing on the screen at once also no pause button if you stop move you almost quite litterally die i hear this game use to be good before all of the real money transaction become available i be kind of so so about this game i do not play it for that long but almost nothing make since what do i do where do i go who be i that s what this game try to do it do not perfect it though i always see some message come up about the mad god but before i read it you can pretty much imagine what happen i do not know what level you should be for some area difficulty wise also i have no idea about anything or anyone because of no explanation half of the tutorial be just you move around the other half be just kill some enemy that you can one shoot if this game have well storyline explanation and community i would recommend it but i do not because it kinda suck,neg

early access reviewdo not install this gamethis be a mediocre game on its own but it act like a virus once its on your pc i try delete it through steam and the launcher stay and redownloade the game then i use the control panel to delete it and the launcher redownloade the game again now it open itself when i start my pc and continually redownload itself my computer tell me the game and the launcher do not exist but they keep redownloade themselves do not install this game,neg
early access reviewnote i have many hour outside of steam as well although it look like a minecraft rip off on the surface once you start play you will realize that it be its own game not all sandbox game with square be try to be minecraft especially this one the graphic 7 5 10ye the graphic be really nice to look at along with the animation the world come alive much more than many other game include minecraft however with all that be go on nearly everything be animate it can get a bit laggy just because your pc can run game like grand theft auto v at 60 fps on high graphic do not mean you can run this game on high graphic i know this firsthand i have all my setting set to minimal i can barely tell the difference between max and minimum graphic visually but it do effect my fps overall really nice graphic and animation but it need to be optimize for minimal lag the ui control 9 10the user interface be fantastic all around it be not the same bare bone ui you would expect in early access game i see you over there ark but be instead detailed and elegant it could use some improvement sure but for early access the ui be really nice and self explanatory the control be somewhat familiar if you have play minecraft there will not be a huge learning curve wasd and mouse button be the same as in minecraft it have more control actually and it still do not seem overwhelming even on your first time play the gameplay 8 5 10like most sandbox game when you load up a world it do not tell you what exactly you need to do you start off explore play with the control and see what there be to offer eventually as you explore you will find a craft table once you find that it become self explanatory find this craft this build this do this it be not confusing however do not mistake this for the game be linear it be not linear at all you can take your survival in many direction unlike many sandbox survival game you have a single do it all tool that come attatche to your character and you simply have to upgrade it to break new type of block this make the game less confusing but may even make it too simplistic however overall the game be quite self explanatory but in a fun way you will not run out of thing any time soon and if you do the multiplayer your world be server when you create a world it become public on the list of world people can search for the name of your world and try to join it you can password protect the world or make it so those who join can not edit the world but anyone can view your world by search the name of the world this make multiplayer with friend extremely easy you simply tell them the name of the world and password if you set one they search it and they can easily join it be fantastic there be also a wide range of administrative tool for your world and setting to make your experience easy or more difficult the community 10 10fantastic community the dev reply to my problem within hour and the community be equally ready and happy to help this be not an immature community the problem there be no chat in the game even if multiple people be online in the same world it require a fairly update graphic card there be a good chance you will need to do some updating of your driver it can lag even on great pc need some optimize i be a little worried about it become free to play at launch i fear the microtransaction overall 8 5 1010 10 would kill leaf creature with a twig again,pos
i be very excited to check out this game sadly every track server that have driver in it apparently would cost me real money to purchase before i can race on it wtf f2p my i will stick with the crew and need for speed,neg
very good game i do not really understand why people hate this game be fun may take some time to kill a deer or any animal but that s like real life you do not expect to find a deer right in front of you you need to find one,pos
early access reviewthis game have have its upp and down but the fact thet they be try to fix it for us show promise people have be bash the game for personal reason more then anything but like any game it will have its critic instead of assume what the game be about why not just play it for yourself i do and fall in love with the game the current state be ok and have proble but the overall game be so much fun that i just do not stop play and do not plan to stop anytime soon,pos
i like elsword even if it feel a little dated be the game as an anime style mmo side scroller beatem up or a side scroll beatem up with mmo element well i can not decide but you may be able to if you try it its fun you may just find yourself hook a note though be that as of this review the game be have all sort of issue launch from steam you can download it with steam but then you will most likely need to launch from the game exe 3 18 14,pos

i can not say i recommend this which honestly make me feel down as i quite enjoy the series movie and original book however the massive amount of lag render this game unplayable and i be not over exagurate about that i literally could not even register because it be lag so badly it take 5 minute for my mouse to move to the register button this game must be horribly optimize or have some kind of basic issue like that because i be capable of run game like subnautica with little to no issue and i can not even get into this game also from my perspective on the menu i see advertisement for at least eight different pay to get pack and whilst that normal for an mmo this one be targette toward child 5 and under which make the whole thing rather sketchy in my book not to mention the obvious fact that it be not free to play if everywhere you look the game be ask for you to pay to get this that or the other,neg
product receive for freeearly access reviewi use to love this game dev of hero and general if your reading this the game would be much more enjoyable if everything in the game 50 off it take week just to get a lmg or a pistole so please make a change and stop make dumb vehical to hide the truth,neg
alright first thing first i have clock about 200 hour on the steam version and roughly 300 on the mobile version i have play this game a lot this be and eld scroll card game it play well and be somewhat balanced in no way be this game pay to win but you can buy the expansion which be quite fun that will add card to your collection that be only obtainable through say expansion you can either pay for them with in game currency or with money the base game be pretty straight forward the campaign be good and there be some story behind it and since its base on the elder scroll if you like the lore you should enjoy the nod it provide now for the expansion dark brotherhood it be fun add some challenge and have an interesting story overall worth pay real money for clockwork city this be an interesting change for the neutral side of the game add a variety of card that can really make have neutral card other than meta card useful i recommend buy with money but in game currency work as well puzzle now these can be quite difficult and brain tease fun to complete but no replay value to them this one do not give you direct access to certain card but card pack i recommend buy this one with in game currency rather than money as the price be not justifyable now on to why i do not recommend the game i will not lie its still one of my go to game to play on my phone and something to kill time but the playerbase be dwindle and you will be able to find match easily but it feel super rig from time to time you will often find yourself in situation where it will give your opponent every single top deck card they need and you do not have a single answer for anything you can often tell from the first 5 6 turn whether or not its go to be a how or not but this be not concrete and you can have some epic comeback the game be balance exceedingly well before the house of morrowind update now that you can have 3 attribute 75 card deck they be often more or less t and annoying to play against some card feel extremely broken though they can have an answer to them if you do not waste your useful card and be often just not fun to play against they add too many new card in one swoop and it throw the meta and average game into a weird place most deck create prior to the expansion feel obsolete and not viable when play against people with seemingly random deck with the new card their slogan be you tired of lose to rng be laughable at good there be quite a few card in the game that be completely rng base and its a card game its go to be rng anyways luck of the draw you can absolutely get decimate by rng in this game and its very annoying seem more prevalent after house of morrowind the last two month of the game do not reward a new card and only give in come currency and card pack for the ranked reward i get they may be run out of idea but i like the fact that a new card be be add at least once a month balance pass seem quite rare and tend to nerf a lot of go to set up card and card that be just really useful in general overall the game be fun but very aggrivating once you have put time into the game and have skill you will never be guarantee a win until the last turn of the game and you can not go into any match expect to win either keep that in mind,neg
after a a 10 minute registration and the 2hour download i get into the game where there be no fov so i feel like i be play through a 2x microscope and to be able to control your car be impossible in itself there be no video setting either i give this a 0 25 100 not reccomende,neg
this game be a mixture between world of warcraft and diablo it play like world of warcraft with the same viewpoint same looting system and gameplay etc ie do pvp gain glory in order to buy pvp gear do heroic dungeon to get epic gear at max level but it then have a diablo twist with the same style gear system and ability system where you have a limited number of spell and you have to choose the good build love the game so far and play 70 hour i would recommend to everybody,pos

early access reviewreally great game build your own robot and fight with them the 11 different teir offer both upgrade to your current weapon armor sheild and mode of transportation as well as introduce new one as you advance through each teir the game have really good balance and you will be hook from the get go i would also like to add that while there be micro transaction they be entirely unnececary as all they have for offer be either cosmetic item or a premium membership which double the money and experience you earn both of which can be gain quite quickly without it,pos

to fully illustrate what make dota one of the most compelling multiplayer game of all time it help to have a bit of background on the game itself dota have its root as a warcraft 3 modification warcraft 3 introduce a unique mechanic in its campaign and multiplayer mode of hero unit unit that actually gain experience point ability and item as the game progress this really make it feel like you have an investment in these unit and you grow attach to them to a degree these hero unit effectively commander of your army of relatively disposable unit become your avatar in game it be a brilliant concept and dota take it a step further dota create a multiplayer mode that focus exclusively on play these hero unit it remove the base building and unit management see in the standard rts format it be one of the good example of less be more than i have ever see and that description hardly do it justice manage your individual hero and your income position on the map constant decision making and be able to size yourself up versus your enemy bring more depth than any other game i have ever play i have yet to play any other multiplayer game where every member of your 5 man team be crucial to your victory everyone must do their part and do it better than the other 5 man team there be very few case of where a game can be winnable 4v5 and teamwork become a huge factor in the most intense and close game the level of immersion really can not be match it be hard to think of another game that draw you in more than dota especially when other people be count on you to do well it be a hectic stressful enormously complex and in depth experience not to mention absurdly fun this be what keep me come back and i would recommend it to anyone look to really experience what multiplayer gaming can truly offer if you be new to the game and want some background on specific hero and strategy or just want to watch some gameplay be sure to check out my youtube channel thank for read,pos

early access reviewcannot recommend the game right now edit below to name a few reason why the game be unoptimize heavily probably the most unoptiomized game i have play in year the graphic and visual be okay but even when you have a 1080ti i7 16 gb of ram and good hdd it stutter lag texture take a bit to load every time on character menu seem to stutter the game when you open them the server issue be bad too frequent disconnect i have try on both 20 20 and 50 50 vdsl do not matter one bit if there be too many connection there be good chance you will be stick at splash screen no matter your connection the game do not try to reconnect again and you be force to restart the game that may also happen if you randomly disconnect after finally get in so atm you have a chance to be one of the lucky one to not be disconnect or be the unlucky one who get to play 20mins out of 4h you spend log in the translation be pretty bad i suppose it could be forgive if the dev do not say they spend 60 million on get the game to na eu the combat system be dumbe down if you be look for an experience similiar to bdo or even tera you will not get it not afaik anyway i look and look and could not find the action combat option in menu while it be there in jp version right now the na eu version have tab targette and sometimes it do not work the voice over half the time sound like it be record in a bathroom with an old mic too close to mouth it be terrible i think that be all and if the dev really improve the optimization server issue and translation i would happily change this review and try the game again but atm for the price bless online be not worth leave other mmos for edit the game be still break af the recent nerf of damage bring all class to 50 75 dmg nerf which make main story quest undoable as dps the marketplace be set in the same way as gw2 marketplace there be no set price there be no account share storage also there be no player to player trade the game have huge memory leak take 7 13 gb of ram when just on heres a report of do the first lvl 13 dungeon as 4 class two dps tank and healer,neg

early access reviewhello all this be my opinion of the game take what i say into consideration before purchase this game week 1 major issue be happen not anything new to a new mmo launch fix pretty quick to say the least apart from other mmo i have play week 2 be ok i believe pvp start up get to experience it and be not bad but some class be op and consider this game be focus on pvp it do not meet alot of player expectation but pvp be hard to balance but pvp be the only end game there week 3 4 dev kick half if not all emissary some deserve to be kick and some do not emissarys be post to give feedback positive or negative if the dev team can not communicate to emissarys then why even develop a huge potential game and very profitable if it be execute right gameplay i think the gameplay be smooth although huge fps problem for alot of people include me i feel optimization could of be well for a early access game that be mostly do just a few minor fix here and there but that be not the case combat be ok kinda feel clunky even switch stance feel clunky to me combat be a slow fast pace mix when use skill but overall pretty fun tame brillant idea that i hate to see go to waste love this aspect of the game you could capture anything just about in the game hope to see other mmo use this idea but make it even better although idk how you could make it even better haha craft it be simple i like that not really into lifeskill that much dungeon be pretty difficult after a few patch but the loot be meh even for the last dungeon this game fail because of poor communication from dev youtuber who only play to lvl 20 and so forth but i can not recommend this game in its current state i hope to see it bounce back but i highly doubt it take to big of a hit,neg
i find fallout shelter to be an amazing game just do not use your money to buy anything like ever i spend 30 on my game and have weapon for everyone everything be perfect then out of nowhere invincible molerats overrun my shelter i pause and google if pay for object and such carry out between save but sadly they do not i waste 30 on this game just so i could be easily overrun it be basically like me spend 29 99 for the game but once you lose you lose the game too this be the only reason i do not recommend this game i strongly disapprove that they be lock to specific save especially consider the fact i spend my hard earn real money oh you lose thank for playing please insert another 29 99 it be like a sick overly expensive arcade machine that instead of quarter cost 29 99 and you do not get 3 life nope just one lose it and you have to pay an arm and a leg just to start over this happen a couple month or so ago but just now decide to rate it final conclusionif you play this do not spend any of your money on this otherwise a great game,neg
the good game on steam above all else if you do not already own this game or intend on play it i suggest you literally just shoot yourself here and now this game contain next gen graphic and gameplay with amazing mutliplayer potential the fishing and farming simulation be second to none and becasue of this the game second as a solid alternative to either the game farming simulator or fishing simulator i definitley prioritize play this game to either study house work or even get a job due to it be amazing feature with not a single bug 10 10 would deeply reconsider what the actual i be do with my life and also reconsider all of my life choice again,pos

fallout shelter be a free to play management game with quest combat and baby make everything be very easy to learn and pick up and all of the different activity be more than enough to keep one occupy the vault dweller the character you control all work very smoothly and offer some humorous comment or easter egg from time to time my only gripe with the game be that it will get stale after a while but before then you should be able to get in plenty of time to enjoy all of the various action and event fallout shelter have to offer 10 10 really worth give it a try,pos

i start play this game on the 15th of august 2012 and little do i know that this game actually would be the most important game i have ever play in my life it have give me so much but storytime later this be my review of the game every 2 week they give out a new patch which shaken up the meta balancing and adjust god item and maybe change some of the ingame elemental on the map and i believe every month there be a new god to learn to play and counter it freshen up the game every time there be 5 class hunter guardian mage assassin and warrior every class design for a different role adc carry support mid jungle or solo however it do not lock the class to their design role usually you would want hunter for your carry and warrior for solo but it do not say an assassin or guardian do not work for solo or a mage for carry it be all about your playstyle and how your team could work as a team and make the composition work every game be different for sure there be alot of playmode aswell you have conquest the standard moba map with 3 lane a jungle and alot of objective this be the most competative playmode and also the one where professional play be involve with smite esport be amazing to look at especially if you enjoy play the game and want to see some really good team play against each other with different practice tactic then you have the casual gamemode such as arena as the name state you be basically just brawl out in a big circle with 3 different buff on each side teamfight and kill be what this mode be for but you have to watch the minion assault be also here where everyone get assign a random god there be just 1 lane and you can not go back into base and buy item unless you die which also put your team in a disadvantage for some second until you return strong to lane however be alive for too long put you at a disadvantage all random all mid this be also obviously the most unbalanced gamemode where your team can lose by just the god you be assign with but hey this be make for casual fun and play god you probably normally would so why would you play assault if you be just go to complain then there be clash the mix between arena and conquest which be 2 lane a huge buff monster in the middle and some sidejungle with a mana buff quite fun but also just really a cluster of switch between lane and outplay the other team the last casual only gamemode be siege which also be two lane and have a big siege monster in middle which be assign to the team that get the killing blow on it this have alot of hp and bring down tower quickly a quite fun gamemode where it be not 5v5 as most other gamemode but there be 4v4 there be also motd or match of the day to touch on where balance be out and there be a new gamemode on rotation with different twist then you have the semi competative gamemode with both casual and rank involved which be joust and duel duel be a rank only 1v1 gamemode where you ban out god you do not want to play against and it be only you to outplay the enemy 1 lane with an objective to turn off the tower and two buff mana and attack buff it be all about outplay joust be nearly the same it be on the same map but it be 3v3 so you alongside two ally play against 3 other to see who come out victorious this game have so much to offer ton of amazing skin and a really great community both on famous smite player on twitch twitter and aswell with reddit and some group on facebook honestly just all around the good moba out there to me atleast because it be indeed a 3rd person wasd movement base moba this game have give me friend over the entire world and i even go from norway to usa to live at some guy house for 2 week all because of smite thank smite for everything you have give and this be definitely my all time favorite online pvp game,pos

early access reviewthe game live up to its reputation of be a mix of hearthstone magic the gathering the only problem be that the gameplay be not fun i truly give it a shot suspend disbelief and complete all the tutorial play an arena play some online game but overall its just a bit too technical to be fun hearthstone be successful because despite it be so simple its fun this have superior mechanic but its just not fun to play if you be look for an alternative card game besides hearthstone i recommend faeria smite tactic be too imba pvzh be not bad too but its mobile only i would say eternal be like dota it only become if you be willing to dedicate time to it,neg
at first this seem really cool before i download it then after spend an hour or so i find it to be a total drm p o s i mean you have to friggn be online just to play this thing wth every time you want o play disassemble assemble a gun the game have to redownload the model why suppose you live where the internet conenction be bad or your camping and want to goof off after a long day hike on your laptop noooooo even the shooting range be limit cause it be only for one kind fo gun you can pick the kindof shooting range you want choose whatever gun you want and start pop off shot no it be whatever they want to give you and only a small fraction of gun get to be use in the shooting range the game be constanly tell you how much more exp you could have earn by buy a booster pack and even fork out 40 do not unlock every item good thing i only get the free version disassembly be dumbe down too oh sure some model require you to remove every screw but only for that region even then most gun assemble disassemble as an assembly mean a group of part com apart at the simple click of a button i really do not feel like you learn much texture range from realisic to flat out lazy the ak and 1911 be very pretty but gun like the tech 9 sport few convincing texture especially the barrel assembly the game go so far as to tell you you can unlock any gun at any time if you pay money while the multiple x ray mode attchment be cool there be really nothing redeem about this at all if i be to actually get a copy that do not require the internet to even use and still require money to buy i would may consider it but inthe end it be really a modern day corrupt app and i do not are if the dev say well we want to preven piracy to heck with that noise this exact philosophy be what make sooooooooooo many gamer tick off about the original feature of the x box 1 so why bother with game like that at all i do not care if this be more of a simulator than a game i care about integrity and i find this game to stink to high noon with questionable business practice real gamer do not need their wallet to unlock feature nay sayer can go suck a lemon,neg

early access reviewit a nice game in general but it have a lack off update and optimaztion you can also see why the german side be get pick more often they have well gun and they be favor in war this make the gameplay a bit fragile i would say that its fun for 50 our with friend just to go and explore around the map but it have no future in it what so ever so if you seek that you should probably wait for battlefield 1 red orchestra 2 or battalion,neg
disregard all of the scathing review for the new look because while i be also not the big fan of the new look and what not i would like to talk about the actual game you dinguse and you know what it be still a fun and balanced card game it be a free to play game that honestly do not feel pay to win in the slight sure the gold grind be a little rough but there have to be some engouragment to do in game purchase to be fair speaking of gold you can buy a deck with a theme like aludin dragon parthunaxx shout for about 500 which i reckon be possible after about 12 hour of somewhat grind and you will be pretty set after that or at least have a nice place to start want to also give prop to the campaign they be neat little story that give pretty great reward the downside be that all except the default story come in 3 act each cost 1000 gold each for a grand total of 3000 gold to play through a whole campaign oof lastly i would like if the arena see a bit of a change or ticket for it be more common without a ticket it cost 150 to enter a good run where you completly beat it all will probably give you around 125 gold huh also i do not like how rng it be your deck rng the special rule rng but be usually something that benifit the opponent all in all a solid expiernece for peep who like card game or be thirst for elder scroll content lore also it be free just give it a whirl dude,pos
note while most of my gameplay hour come from way back this review be about the current state of the game not about what it use to be in short robocraft be a game which allow considerable freedom to build creative bot and then battle it out it be also a game which do not really allow much creativity if you want to be competetive the autobalance be bad and new small bot will be match against massive leviathan with more gun than you own progression tie to loot box think battlefront 2 good side lot of tool and part to build exactly what you want many map detailed info about your bot allow for easy planning support many control scheme simple pre make start for new player leave cpu unused give damage boost but bad side large bot with many gun get a health boost all progression tie to random loot crate luck matchmake small bot match with one 10x the cpu no proper feeling of progression just random only 2 gamemode with respawn available get repetetive overall robocraft be a game which have many interesting system but which also do not support create with them while dev have make this game more accessible they have also cut away so much bad matchmaking ensure you will have a hard time unless you get lucky or pay up for the loot crate lock progression behind random chance be just the last straw i can not recommend this game,neg
early access reviewthe game have some issue when it have a glitch that prevent hyperspace when the game start and require a rejoin as well as some ping issue when other game ping run better than other possibly lack of many server but besides that it run smoothly even if its at a low fps you can see everything go on and the graphic be amazing as well as attention to detail one thing i look forward to see in this game be more ship damage like an ablity to ram a ship in a weak point and tear it in two i look forward to continue to support and play the game and its potential for the future,pos

early access reviewthis be a great game eternal be pretty much slightly simplify magic the gathering that feel like more like hearthstone in term of gameplay speed you can easily pay for card to get your collection go but the reward system be generous with handout as well if you be a twitch prime member you also get a nice infusion of card pack as of 9 1 18 which be very helpful i end up buy gem for the campaign chapter which i normally pay for in any card game i play online but it look like you can grind gold to pay for them as well rng can be frustrating at time give you only resource card and then give you no resource card while give you only one mulligan but such be life eh give it a try it be free,pos

ever since the developer switch this game have lose its charm grant that it still play the same and some of the loading screen time have be reduce the gameplay experience have suffer significantly the table itself be reminiscent of hearthstone with less emphasis on card artwork animation and voice act and more emphasis on garrish color minimize detail and reduce actual game time,neg
ok first i have be 56h into this game at first i think this game be great because i like yu gi oh and this game be beginner friendly the p2w element be not very expensive i have see bad today i play a pvp duel i get my opponent into 400lp leave then he play a monster with an effect that make him pay 1000lp at the end phase so i be like yes he be go to suicide at the end of my turn i win but i be play my card and i notice my time limit be at 3 secs i hurry up to play my card but it be too late loss by time limit since when a card game lend you a fix number of second to play your card for all the battle duration in all card game when it be either player turn the timer be reload especially in this game where there be ton of effect you would take time not too long to read your cardseffect and your opponent this be disgusting and humiliating to lose like this for those who be lazy take their time to read card or be just slow i would not recommend this game because with this timer system the game basically tell you to hurry the hell up and play ps the timer be only for pvp duel not pve one,neg

elsword be a whole lot of fun if you be into fighting game the game have an interesting cast of character and very very many choice regard moveset and playstyle the game skill system be expansive and sometimes seem too big but i be an indecisive person so i just have to deal with it the core game mechanic be wonderful and the ability to chain combos off of one another almost flawlessly be incredibly gratify the equipable weapon and armor system be interesting but it can get very annoying to micromanage and the sheer amount of item and number to consider can be a turnoff one major complaint i have be that the game seem to be center around these event that keep you play the game will give you the opportunity to find these crazy item and equipable armor or weapon which be awesome and all but you can lag behind a lot if you miss an event in short the game struggle heavily with power creep they keep ramp up the power of these exclusive weapon and item so that you can be even strong if you get the stuff from this event and the cycle continue as the stat go higher also the item drop can get flat out ridiculous for instance on my main character i accumulate over 1200 complete recovery potion those thing restore all your hp and mp what the hell this basically make me unkillable in any dungeon of my level which make the game cool for a little bit but boring and trudge after a while overall though i would recommend it,pos

early access reviewthe good multiple soldier class to choose from mean multiple play style to utilize and select from separate resource for soldier and assault team the ability to rank up your soldier and their individual weapon skill to specialize them how you wish the ability to unlock more powerful gear and vehicle by invest time and experience into the previous level the ability to unlock and choose a perk for your soldier in combat such as fast reload reduce damage take and carry more ammunition three nation to choose from allow different gear between faction with few exception each soldier can earn more for fight base on their rank provide an incentive to continue to improve and rank up the ability to give a general gear to other soldier of the same faction once say soldier become a general the bad each soldier start with no experience base gear and must play through the same tutorial to start earn credit in battle just by play experience gain be painfully slow with gain and reward become more insignificant over time until they start become not only more miniscule but more time consume as well each experience tree not only unlock different perk but different item and do not intersect often hold new item in the middle or later stage of the tree each nation unlock different thing in different order mean some nation will be able to unlock well equipment at different point such as tank at least one soldier must reach the rank of field officer before you can participate in the general part of the game unless you purchase a general or high rank soldier use real world cashall weapon vehicle class and assault team can be purchase use real world currency the only exception be ribbon level and perk which can be unlock faster use booster or a premium accounteach player be thrust into match with high level player randomly upon reach rank 3 with one soldier mean they often face off against vastly superior enemy very early on even the balanced match be not balance because soldier number on each faction in battle can be uneven to an extent all three faction be treat as separate entity make a game base off of the second world war seem more like a free for all game spawn point can be easily camp by enemy player use tank make for a highly dissatisfying battle vehicle can be spawn sideways upside down or in the immediate line of fire make high action point a nightmare to use especially when say point be the only remain one to spawn from weapon can be modify to allow for instant one shot capability no matter where the victim be hit frame rate and connectivity be a huge issue especially during high activity in small area weapon can be modify to allow for extreme fire rate make it nigh impossible to react before one be kill ally player be able to repeatedly kill their own team with little to no recourse note as of yet other than a minor loss of experience gain any type of currency be slow and tedious on top of the high cost of modified and specific gear player can join battle late and end up earn absolutely no reward for participation even if they play a significant role in the battle player can buy the ability to equip two perk a fourth weapon and gain a boost to resource and experience earn through a premium account certain perk either do not seem to work right or be consider overpower such as the ability to remove the kill camera which be actually the ability to see where you be kill from player can enter match in which they will be force to fight against tank player even if their team have none and oftentimes can not do anything about it other than be crush this happen even in the balanced game mode in game war last an average of 2 3 day require player to select their server and faction all over again every time one end even if they themselves do not participate paratrooper can not jump out of a drop plane that be currently plummet without incur a suicide penalty meaning whomever shoot down the plane get a free reward for kill them edit you may not occur a suicide penalty or give another credit but you still die instantly once it be start to plummet fighter plane have little to no variety and be build almost entirely for joystick user in their control player earn a miniscule amount of gold fund once per day just for playing and would need to play one battle every day for 294 day in order to purchase the low rank war bond in the shop which reward them with a total amount equivalent to 310 day worth of first battle bonus over half a year meanwhile the low amount of gold available for an equivalent of 350 day worth cost under 8 usd for whomever consider that this be an unfair review for a game consider to be in early release still please note that this be a personal opinion and an early release review on top of that meaning that as more patch be add this review shall be edit and reconsider over time as it stand though i can not recommend this game to anyone for the reason that it seem highly prime to detriment new or less skilled player and benefit not only the highly experienced or skilled player but also the one who throw money at it and yes i do calculate the equivalency of currency to time need to reach that point,neg

tf2 be a casual free to play first person shooter on its own that do not really translate to much but with a wide variety of game mode incredibly high skill cap and diverse class with a variety of weapon to cater to a large amount of playstyle tf2 do stand out as be a cut above the rest balancing unfortunately be not as strong as it could be and there be a few legitimately overpower weapon and not all class be equal in usefulness however with the lack of cash shop base game stat and the default weapon generally be the most versatile and reliable in the game on top of the skill cap of the class keep in mind the casual nature of the game any issue with balance be minor enough that it can be work around through player skill and team coordination their business model only require a single item to be purchase from the in game store or to be gift a premium upgrade package at which point any cosmetic weapon or upgrade can be find through play the game craft or purchase through in game resource it be a very fair game with one of the best free to play model in the market the primary difficulty you will find with the game be start it with a lackluster tutorial un cordinated public game and little assistance in the relatively deep tactic and game mechanic for the various class it can be hard to become skilled enough to coordinate in solo play play with friend and do some research into the game be highly recommend as tf2 will not do it for you tf2 on it be own be highly mod friendly and have a variety of community make server run custom game mode with a bit of search you can find hangout mini game training server custom map unofficial weapon and the like on top of the official game and fairly friendly community it be not especially difficult to get hundred of hour of enjoyment out of the game without any issue or requirement to invest money it have its problem but ultimately they be minor what tf2 offer be a rich fps experience with enough community support to satisfy a variety of taste so i have no issue recommend this game to any fps fan look for a team focus objective base shooter,pos

early access reviewme at launch i like this game it be a unique vehicular base shooter where teamwork and communication be the key to success sadly this game be fill with 10 year old but even without communication its a cool time killer you get to design your vehicle fairly easy and its pretty cool that everyone have a different machine add a large amount of diversity to the game to get cube to build your vehicle you earn a currency during match that you can buy cube with and you unlock more cube with a different currency there be another currency that cost real money but it buy the same thing as the f2p currency and a couple cosmetic but that be it a very fun game me later ok they change the game a little bit in way i do not really like but it be still an ok game you still have the f2p currency and the p2p currency but now you do not need to unlock the cube it make it so someone can take a super op gun and put it on their tiny vehicle and it get group up with the weak vehicle with 20 very weak gun it do not matter how small the op vehicle be because it kill anything that it see instantly there be also now a community market which allow people to post their creation and other people can download them if they pay for all the cube that it cost to build it a cool sharing system but now people can just download the very well build vehicle which mean now there be no creativity or diversity in most match when 5 people have the same op vehicle a pretty t update if you ask me but the game be still all right i guess me now this game it ing suck now there be no f2p currency nothing now we have ing crate oh wow so unique ing crate you can get all the cube you could have buy before by play the game but now you get very very very much less oh you spend the entire match heal a guy who be defend the base and pretty much save your team from annhilation oh here you can have the bad chest in the ing game that give you 20 corner block so now you be ed because when you be try to build a unique vehicle have fun build it out of corner block meanwhile the guy you heal the entire match get 20 kill and get the good crate in the game so while you have corner block that selfish have a heat seek rocket launcher oooorrrrrr you can spend 20 and have all the cool stuff and win the game so yea do that freejam freejam more like paytohaveachancejam do your self a favour and never play this game in this state if they fix thier game they probably will not i will change my review have fun hopefully play a different game,neg
  this be my review of this game for starter the game be about ww2 where you pick faction in early game the soviets the germans and the ally us each faction have pro and con for what i observe it be a free to play game make by reto moto the game itself be fun wide map you have opportunity to become a pilot tanker recon or a general itself please do not be like those bad general if you become one like the map have no car bike etc as a new player of the game you will have an infantry as a starter character of the game if you play us you will have m1 garand which have good sight in my opinion if you play germany you will have g43 or gewehr 43 which have good precision when not aim if you play soviets you will have svt 40 it be a flexible gun now here come the new player life as a new player you will be on bronze tier and will be on encounter match this be the good part when you try to understand the game mechanic use this opportunity to understand the game just my advice you will be verse with bronze skill till silver skill then gold once you have hit the gold tier welcome to the bad part of the game q why be it bad when you be onto gold skill tier a as a new player you will be just run use bicycle use civilian truck and you will be get camp by recon or infantry with bolt action rifle 1 hit this part will irritate you the most a the second bad be that tank with he shell spawn camp you be grateful if one of your teammate be anti tank psycho a the third bad part the plane will destroy you if they see you run in the open my advice if they have fighter plane heavy fighter plane and you do not have a car go run in the forest area or a place where keep you hide with shadow a the fourth bad part be that once you be onto cap zone enemy who have heavy set badge will be hard to kill because heavy set badge reduce damage and you be just use your tiny cute stock tier 1 gun and you will be the one who get kill first because they have well gun than you a the fifth bad part for you you will be verse with insanely good player in some game the matchmaking have skill callibration where you get to your own skill tier and this game have do not q why i do not recommend this game a the game be way too grindy this make you pay a real dollar into a pixel money sound stupid but that be the reality of this game i prefer to grind in an different mmorpg game than to grind in this game a reto or the game company do not listen to the community opinion they just make new bs plane new gun they should improvise the map with weather and the infantry character for me once you get your 1 hit gun mgs badge car plane tank good assault rifle then the game start to be fun let me tell you if you want to enjoy be tilt trigger or become a masochist then this game be for you my game rating 4 10,neg

business tour have surprise me in many way some way be negative some way be positive let us look at this in more detail when i first notice business tour on the store page i be not intrigue in any way whatsoever why simply because board game be not really my go to when play video game however i decide that i need to try something new and actually give this game a chance before i ignore it like any other game that do not spark my interest i never know that my decision would later completely change my outlook on board game as a whole business tour have me addict from the first hour of gameplay and i honestly could not believe it this game allow for strategical thinking which really be the sole reason to why i fall in love with this game in the first place this game be also mainly focus on the concept of luck pretty much deem every game to be unpredictable thus make it for me much more entertaining however although this be a great feature they take the idea of luck to a whole new level and this be not necessarily a good thing player such as myself have notice that most game have be prove to be very one sided have one player get an insane amount of property or cash whilst other player have be virtually deprive of these thing compare to them this really take away the sense of achievement when emerge as the winner in a certain game and this honestly take away the fun this game aim to give despite this flaw i can not help but to love this game for it be creativity and enjoyment consider it be also free to play i definitely recommend it to anyone search for an enjoyable board game experience,pos

early access reviewi think this game be somewhat difficult to play even though i have be play adventurequestworld for over a year i would definitely recomend adventurequestworld to this one because not only do some of the control scheme not work but some thing get more difficult like pick up item in aqw the game would automatically collect item the enemy you kill yield but in this you have to manually pick up drop and add on with the bad camera control can make it infuriating to try to do i definitly think this game have potential if it be updatied to fix some of these issue as well as make it a little easy get a grip on if this be the first adventure quest game,neg
this game be fun and all untill you get sever be not respond even though you can play every other single game send in a ticket do not really help and make new account do not work even my ranger have a glitch besides the server problem and that be be he lose every quest and could not level up i spend about 30 on this game because i think it be put together and well make but these dev really suck because they do not make the gameplay smooth and it be really frustrating when you can not play it be really fun but i be just so feed up on have to delete the game and restall it also the patch be huge so when you need to restall you have to wait hour for it patch please fix this,neg

i try to like this game do not call me out on my playtime because i be play before it come to steam but since i have come back after a while there be many frustrating problem and ridiculous developer desicion firstly the launcher be complete and utter garbage most of the time i find myself wait for 2 3 hour to get in because the loading screen freeze and eventually crash then tell me i should verify the file which take about 10 20 minute then after verify the file it do the same exact thing rinse and repeat it be very frustrating when i actually get into the game the beg level be actually quite fun and the combat be nice but when you get to the high level you be block by an immense amount of grinding and paywall the event be garbage pvp be a pay to win and pve be like queue into a pile of who have alot of money and pay for everything who do not know what to do verdict use to be a fun game the beginning level be fun but later in the game be destroy developer please fix this game and you will have gain another player for now 4 10,neg

the thing about this game be that it have so much potential the detail the fun and everything only 1 thing bring it all the way down it be that it will take age by age i mean age for you to actually unlock a new gun get xp to unlock a gun will take a long time you can reassemble and disassemble gun again and again but it will not give you that much of xp the only sustainable way of get xp be the daily reward which be flaw by itself everyday you get more and more xp 100 200 500 until 3000 think that it will help you out i think the same too but then after reach 3000 on day 7 the count restart to the measly 100 so much for come on everyday and this reward will increase so if you count the daily reward that you can get in a week that tally up to 6800 which at first seem like a lot but eventually you have to unlock gun that cost almost twice that amount so you just have two week of opening and close the game before you can get to any action when i play i always ask myself what be the point of have so many gun if you can not even use them the price to unlock all the gun be ridiculous too 50 dollar you may as well just add 10 buck to it and get battlefield 4 or something in conclusion this game could have work out brilliantly only a flawed daily reward system and the crazy amount of time need to progress bring it down all the way 3 10 star,neg

surprisingly great game at least for an oldschool arpg lover like myself for me it outperform d3 main competitor on todays arpg market in every possible way needless to say i have already spend 100 hour in poe and it seem that this number will significantly increase over time pro dark atmosphere it be way dark than most game nowadays i dig it well balanced of course there be thing that be still arguable plenty of choise i mean plenty you can build really crazy character that still do not suck even on third difficulty real free to play no p2w at all completely even char slot count and stash size be quite fine by default game evolve over time new skill unique balance tweak every month act 4 in development all of this free of charge of course con desync on third difficulty with 10 exp death penalty it can be pretty annoying particularly for the melee char class i will not be explain this problem a lot here just google it there be plenty info out there,pos

ignore the 0 5 hour that s just the steam version i be in tier 5 america and have a positive kill death ratio in the p 51 mustang to anyone who have ever play this game long enough you will praise me as your new lord or repel me in the name of christ for anyone else let me tell you why this game have so much potential to be good but it squander it in the silly of way so let me just get this out of the way it be russian bias not even go to lie do not have to because i be in the safe steam forum where kgb i mean gaijin developer can not execute my post imagine this it be a terrible day to be a tanker the germans have a tiger and you have 1 t 34 in real life you win by number advantage in warthunder you win because the tiger decide to replace it be armor with paper and line it be hull with high explosive ammunition i can not believe how many time i have be ammo rack in a tiger you can be shoot in the track and your tank could randomly explode how do gaijin explain the game be still in developement that be why when tank first come out let just reduce the list capability of all german cannon by about 20 or if you wanna be technical model it at 15 degree before even regard what you be hit so technically you could hit something dead on and still be penalize 15 degree and just be glance off be this just one case example definietly not everytime they put new stuff in the game while completely ignore exist issue if it be russian they just say screw it raise all of its value from the previous plane time that by 2 and make it a ufo if it be anything else case example the twin mustang which be litterally a p51 time 2 be actually now 1 2 in value instead of make sure that the plane and tank in the game work well and historically they add in more plane and with the twin mustang be too lazy to even code the second engine wtf logic be that look i be not go to recommend this game this game feel like an abusive relationship in which many like me be give false feeling of love frankly the kick that i can get out of this game be win in a tiger or p 51 because the odd be stack so poorly in your favor that its the feeling of satisfaction that i like if you play for that i applaud you but for everyone else fly ufo plane and ww2 t 90 you be so blind to how bad this game really be btw i can agree with many of the other negative review but the positive review seem like they be from easily impressed people the funny one be from people who recognize the blatant issue but still think this game be worth it i do not as a ww2 history enthisiast i have be push to world of tank that be how bad this game have become at least war gaming have a method to their madness here make sure you pray to rngesus,neg
i differ from most reviewer that i have read my gripe be not against the cynical pay2win design or anything like that i utterly loathe the art and the game mechanic people say this game look pretty i i be truly flabbergast by that as i think it be the ugliest most generic look piece of garbage and the game mechanic be superficial and in no way interesting i would stay away from this game a long long way away,neg
early access reviewshould you get this game ansew be yes and let me tell you why it all start a long time time ago rughly about 16 hour play on ring of elysium and boi oh boi be i sceptical people be say its a well pubg but i know as pubg have laggy server and i think to my self bright if you get this game you will be dissapote nope i be wrong good battle royal game i have play so far it also have bot and custom match come to it d how exciting,pos
i be not sure i would bother it be an okay game if you just have it run in the background while you be do something else but later on in the game the table just turn to the absurd i have fail like 7 8 rush in a row when they have a 30 or low failure rate this happen because radroaches spawn inside and start siphon off all my energy and mole rat for some reason at high level siphon energy extremely fast also everything siphon energy when you get above 60 people in your vault the game just spike in difficulty when you get to 40 and to 60 people so i think the smart way to play the game would be to just sit on your hand and try and pump up all your character below 39 people and then play the game afterwards even so the mechanic be stupid if someone break into your vault and nobody be in a room which happen it seem 90 of the time they go for an empty room you have to send people from another area then they inevitably get there too late and the invader burrow to another room so eventually all your people be run everywhere and you can not keep track of which character have a good gun to actually fight off this invasion all the while everyone take radiation damage and physical damage and they be siphon off your energy which in turn shut down the majority of your vault building its great so then you have to temporarily pull people off of every other duty they be do when your vault be hum like a swiss watch and put them onto energy production then you have to manage to remember to put everyone back where they be before hand a near impossible task its just an annoyance a huge annoyance then if you be lucky you spend the rest of the time just click on status update like gather energy or gather food or the rare opportunity that you be able to to level someones stat up i think this game would be a lot well if the endurance stat do not exist apparently the only way to really level up your hero health a lot be to pump up their endurance so you have to put all your low level on endurance training for like 4 real time day to pump up their endurance only then can you really make use of them in other capacity if you really want to maximize their experience it be pretty dumb the whole game feel like a waste of time sadly i just do not have much else to play so i be do it i swear though the first time someone come in and wipe my vault i be do with this game forever its really a micro transaction game about gamble with the lunchboxe they give you early on because lunchboxe that you have to buy with real money to get in any regularity contain card which can help you when you be struggle but they can also just give you useless legendary material that 99 of people will never be able to use because they will quit the game before they can make the stuff its stupid even then manufacture a rare weapon take 16 real hour i can only imagine a legendary one would take 5 day or something so in short stay away it just be not fun enough over the long term the only real fun i have be go out on quest and even those require you to wait hour and hour unless you buy some nuka cola yes real money again to speed thing up it be just a way to siphon money and its too nakedly obvious to want to even do it generally game like this have you provide you with a fun experience along the way but this one just feel 100 design to siphon money,neg
early access reviewthe game be not bad at the start it be really nice get use to the switch combo be the hard part of the game then i get ban because i be use a outside program i have no out side program so i get ban for no reason on that one waste 77 hour on this game to get wrongfully ban contact customer support and that so far have not be worth it can not even get a response,neg

i want to like this game but its feed a gambling addition that in mind i be watch the odd and like all game that feature card or random odd i be count i be give it a thumb up for now i have suspicion that they scale difficulty in the event like the draft and event understandably you have a level as well if there be scale odd associate with these feature it should be disclose in black and white feature odd against the scaling and or disclose the player pool you be against at each level or do not modify the odd beyond pure random,neg

planetside 2 be one of those game with an unusual combination of genre however it work in this game advantage because it be work out really well come back to my point earlier a fps mixed with a mmo be not the combination you think of when make a game or it be but very hard to work out planetside 2 do this very well there be 3 unique world where you aim for domination by claim land as your own there be also 3 team replubic who be part of this battle in short only 1 world already contain thousand of player duke it out to be the victor that be just so much fun and work correctly there be 6 class to choose from so you can choose the character that fit you the most your class have different weapon and style depend on the replubic you choose this also come in the form of vary vehicle which also work very well in this game there be both land vehicle and airplane and both be easy to handle once you get the hang on it it will take some time before you have build your character with customization and weapon but trust me it be definitely worth it and if you be not sure about what weapon to choose you can hire them for some time or test them out for free as much as you want in the training section there be 3 world in total one be indar the kind of desert world most of the time that world be also most crow on the other hand you have esamir the snow world this one be usually the most quiet and finally there be amerish which be a jungle world this one be mixed on people there be one negative point that i also have to mention that one be character customization which be not or almost not part of this game everybody look the exact same depending on your class you be able to give you armor and weapon several color but this will cost you real life money and it be not worth it planetside 2 be definitely worth check out i would advice pick this up with friend though because it can be a bit boring when you go alone,pos

early access reviewi see a lot of people complain about now have to spend 20 on pro even without it you can still do a lot of thing perhaps they be upset that they can not fly or use a flashlight both which come with the pro account i play a while without it but decide to upgrade to help support the game as people have say creativerse be a lot like minecraft it be also a lot more though instead of craft normal tool such as a pickaxe or an axe you make cell each one help you dig further and further into the ground until you come to the final layer you unlock recepie by craft other item make a wooden fence and you unlock wooden gate and stone fence for example instead of cow pig and sheep you have weird monster like creature that you can tame once you feed them they will produce item which you harvest with your cell then you must bathe them rinse and repeat of course like many new game there be a few bug you need to keep your tame monster in the stay position if you let them wander they may dissappear for good i would give this game an 8 5 out of ten i look foreward to more update in the future,pos

ps2 be a great game and i highly recommend it if you have get a strong enough pc to play it smoothly be play on and off for the past couple of year not on steam i have 389 hour in on the miller european server before i switch to the u s west coast server for a grand total of 418 as of this write a big thing for me be that the player base tend to be considerably more decent than that of a lot of other competitive shooter type mmos i have play and dbg seem to be really on top of hacker and cheater lately they tend to announce in game when they have boot a cheater i recently see a broadcast message to all player a few session ago that ding dang dong have be bing bang ban for cheat i guess the guy name be that or something like that and the admin online be feel frisky get a kick out of that anyway but of course the real kick of the game be the massive battle involve 100 150 player with bomber and fighter spar overhead as the tank and sundies troop transport mobile spawn point roll across the battlefield amid the blip of player on foot it really accomplish something there and the feel be great as with any free to play game progression be painfully slow if you do not spend some money on the game to get a few important goody like a heavy pistol anti aircraft gun for your max and light tank and some heavy weaponry for your heavy tank but the begin weapon be note as be competitive in all honesty i really do not know if i would continue to enjoy the game nearly as much if i would never spend a cent on it and i have be pretty cheap we be on a tight budget so i have spend 30 total on it but i suppose it be a matter of patience i can say though that if you can the game be worth the money you will spend on it unless you be on a core 2 duo or something in that case just no you be go to be very frustrated with this i be not sure i think they have optimize it better but it be still very heavy feeling at least on our 4 gb core 2 duo clunker those caveat aside it be a great game and i highly recommend it,pos

i have to compare it with hearthstone because it be very similar and we all know that hearthstone be at the top right now i will break into part while review pay to win vs not so pay to winish as far as i play we be all aware that hearthstone be p2w because without pack you can not have card without card you can not make a decent deck without a deck you be enforce to lose earning pack be not that easy or fun and when those hard earn pack give you only 1 rare card it get really annoying let not forget that they bring a new expansion each 3 4 month or so you have limit time to get the card you want you can always pay though in this game as far as i have see it be easy to earn and drop legendary and epic card i get like 5 legendarie in my 5 hour playtime each pack give you 12 card you have more chance and you get what you deserve p s hearthstone pack rate make me a fckn psycho 1 legendary in 30 pack gameplay1 this game have so many card type that i can not even remember while play i think a majority them make no sense charge poison stun spell i can understand every card game have them but there be many other that i can not even remember their name hearthstone be easy to understand for these aspect idk in what condition it be right now 2 so you can not attack minion in this game directly with other minion you select your minion to attack if the other player choose to block with one of his minion you attack the minion instead of the hero it be a little different and i do not like it it get so confusing with other aspect of the card while play i be like how the f do he attack me and i could not or i just block you how can you attack my hero i simply do not like it 3 your mana do not increase on its own you deck consist of 75 card 30 of them be by default mana card that when use you gain 1 mana and can be use 1 each round this make the deck creation process more hardcore you can decide on this yourself but sometimes i be draw like no mana card and stick at 4 mana while my oponent be at 11 manas events singleplayer etci only play the tutorial singleplayer mode and it feel normal like hearthstone would have also the same mode do exist like create a deck and play with other player until you loose a certain time for a prize i think that be all i be really hope to like it but i do not maybe i still have a love for hearthstone deep in i do not play anymore or maybe it be just bad and confusing like i say,neg

why do steam allow a mobile game onto their store just because it be popular you have no reason to download it to your pc just get it for your phone they just copy and paste the game app from the phone they do not even make it a proper fullscreen so that i be leave stare at like a 3rd of my screen with a background on both side and they not even change the ui to make it easy to navigate in with a computer,neg

i love this game to death it be an amazing game but gaijin have push the limit on their playerbase just google the free abrams debacle their forum mod be at time obnoxious and they be use shady and flagrantly obvious mean to squeeze money out of people i understand it be free to play and they need to make money off of that i respect that however they also have do a terrible job of communicate with the playerbase and it have get to the point where it be frankly insult the in game economy be not set up properly you can lose money even after get multiple kill and complete objective if you die balance be a constant issue particularly in air realistic battle it have now become obvious in the extreme they be now intentionally release unbalanced but shiny new content which net them the large amount of money while manage to ignore and in some case offend the concern of their dedicated player the grind be insane and take an unbelievable amount of time and effort to unlock and make the upper tier vehicle survivable at all in combat it would not be so bad if i do not have a life outside of this game i want to be able to at least progress in a manner that do not take literal month i have play this game for year but with all the other aforementioned issue it be start to lose its appeal to me it be at this point obvious to me that the management of the company have probably sit around a table discuss this issue and probably quite literally laugh with each other because they know people will still keep give them money,neg

i enjoy my time play this it have pretty simple yet fun combat and when you be not explore the game world you can create your own you get a house you can bring with you to each world like a campsite that you be free to customize to help you out on your adventure which give you a great chance to show off your building skill to other player this game be definitely worth check out i be a big fan of mmorpg and while i realize this style be a homage to minecraft this style be not really see in an mmo set very often which make the game unique since it be try to make the voxel style appeal to a vastly different market it be definitely worth check this game out,pos
early access reviewadventure quest be the good web base rpg ever and now it become a 3d which add awesomeness to the game and i really love it if you want an adventure of a lifetime then play adventurequest 3d because it be more fun to fight undead and dragon and anything under the sun together with your imagination with an overwhelming story behind every quest you conquer indeed this be the excellent game that artix entertainment produce for the many successful year they have in game industry good job ae,pos
indeed even though i have get almost a 1000 hour log not even include the many hour play this outside steam before it officially launch i can not recommend war thunder reason the grind it be horrible it take hundred of hour to unlock high tier tank and plane force you to grind or pull your wallet the graphic be great the gameplay be great except for terrible balance issue and it will hook you but it would be well to avoid be hook a terrible waste of time if the grind in the high tier be comparable to tier 1 2 it would be a great game but of course that would mean many player will reach endgame unlock everything there be to unlock and potentially lose interest great for player bad for gaijin as every customer be a potential virtual opium addict milkable of cash it take 1000s of dollar to unlock everything a premium account only help on low tier you still have to grind xx xxx hour on the high tier and that be the problem freemium be not free i be all for force free to play user to grind but those that spend money on a premium account should notice a huge difference and that be clearly not the case spend 60 usd on a premium account 1 vehicle unclock be but the tip of the tip of the iceberg so even if you pay it will not make a difference on high tier the reaility be that it take month or week at 40 hour a week use a premium account that be just ridicilous get million of convertable xp use it to progress faster but pay 50 usd on top of that to be allow to actually use it there simply should not be such a grind for pay user spend around 60 usd should give you a lot more bang for buck pay 100 usd for a tank take the fun away gaijin can do whatever they want it be free but the implementation be offensive to loyal pay user i would happily spend my money on premium but the difference be so small that i do not do so anymore every game even those that hold a pricetag should have a certain amount of grind the difference between free and premium progression be just too small to justify the price it take to progress,neg

early access reviewok let go through the pro and con pro 1 there be plenty to craft 2 you can upgrade your mining cell 3 there be a lot to do and the game be super fun con 1 early on there be a really hard mob that you have to fight call the dust devil and i think it should only spawn when you have a sword at least well than obsidian and there be no more con so it be a great game and i highly reccomend it,pos

first off why do steam allow a mobile game onto their store just because it be popular you have no reason to get this port just get it for your phone if only it be a good game this game only gimmick be that it be the original format no synchro no xyzs no pendulum just the og card except the fact that konami have to put in new card into the game in order to boost consistency and support also you only have 3 monster card zone and 3 spell trap card zone which make some card and archtype like dark scorpion unplayable speaking of card where be the good card 80 of the card be pack filler garbage 15 be decent 4 9 be good and 01 be great also some card from the og format be go for some reason most of the element hero fusion be not there some gladiator beast be miss and there be only two monarch and the reason for why the monarch be go be the main reason of why this game suck the og format suck almost all of the card suck and the concept of archtype be still be figure out so consistency and support be nonexistent synchro xyzs pendulum and even link summoning be far well than the og format each one help evolve yu gi oh into a well game except maybe link summon sychros make the extra deck actually worth have xyzs speed the game up and allow easy access to the extra deck pendulum allow well swarm and link summoning help counter op extra deck spammer what do the og have a lot of crappy fusion that be not worth run and ritual monster that only where relevant due to two ritual archtype that come out after the og format literally the only reason that you would play this game be for nostalgia and nostalgia be the only thing that will carry you through this game if you understand this game even a little you will become to op for npc in no time you will mow through them so efficiently that not auto dueling will become torture really fast in 24 hour i be almost able to collect all the card available for one box set of card that have 600 total card in it with the amount of card you get with each pack be only three measly card it only take me around 30 pack to make a deck that be so good that i have to brick in order for my opponent to have a chance to beat me as for keep you come back to the game the game offer pathetic event and the fact that every energy bar that be the staple for long mobile game like this fill up really quickly that you have no choice but to keep playing which be bad for game like this the reason the energy bar exist be to keep gameplay in quick short burst and prevent burn out if a mobile game force you to sit down and empty your battery it go against the entire point of a mobile game finally another big problem with this game be the skill to keep thing simple the skill allow you to cheat and make the game even easy skill have appeal because it make you feel like your playing like they do in the anime but let it sink in that everyone in the original season cheat and the anime have to make up card and edit exist card in order to allow the heore win with their terrible deck grant you do not have to use skill unless you want to play against other player speak of which how be play against other player not that good the more you face off against high level player the more you start see the same card over and over again be this game good no be this game at least playable yes but not for long there be far well yu gi oh game that you could be play instead that play this be down right stupid just play one of the console handheld the actual card game or buy and play yu gi oh legacy of the duelist on steam 3 10 would never want to play this game ever again,neg

  before read keep in mind i have close to 30 ish hour but my bethesda launcher break so i re download it on steam this game be great especially if you be a lore guy the card artwork be not sloppy and the game itself be quite interesting if you like elder scroll but may not be into card game i would give it a try anyway the story be not very good but it be more about gameplay every race play differently for example imperial spawn large number then buff them up it bring you in slowly but if you jump straight into multiplayer it can be a bit overwhelming all in all for the price of 0 i would say its fantastic,pos

early access review it be in fact the recent slew of negative review that first bring this product to my attention while explore my que and get me curious as to what the hubbub be all about then later on that same day a twitch youtube streamer that i frequent start stream the game and get me really curious once i actually see the gameplay i think this game be a blasty blast it bring thoughtfully strategic and tactical gameplay in a 3 dimensional environment to a broad genre of game that be very similar to each other longtime rts moba and shooter fan alike could all find different reason to like this game the ship be gorgeous and remind me of cover art for sci fi novel out of the 80 and 90 i e larry niven steve webber isaac asimov and the like if you be ever that guy that like the idea of moba arena style gameplay like lol dota 2 hero of the storm paragon smite etc etc but be look for something that slow thing down a little bit not the length of match but the pace of gameplay then this could be the game for you add in the fact that you be pilot massive warship with kilometer long engagement range instead of a wee widdle hero champion trudge down the same dirt path and it get even well fan of game like x2 x3 x4 that think the world be a little lonely without other people or the strategy gem sin of a solar empire that want some more fast paced and short game time match but still want to get their blowy up the space ship on should give this a try people who like the concept of eve online and enjoy the basic pvp gameplay but get turn off by the way super hardcore community world etc may also want to try this out hell even starcraft fan may find something to like in this game the community be dangerously small i hope this game make it to full release and the overall level of content have a long way to go before this game be ready for the masse but it have that magic spark that could could develop into something awesome if you want more on the negative aspect of the game go find another review if you want to figure out what make this game awesome just install it and give it a try and be patient this be not call of duty in space,pos

i try this and it fail to impress me i love racing game and have be play them for 15 year on pc i could not get my wheel which admittedly be pretty ancient to work properly find the car seem to have no weight look pretty enough but if actual gameplay suck then its not worth the price of admission in my humble opinion this do not hold a candle to the brilliant but old papyrus grand prix legend which be still a challenging and enjoyable experience even ten year on i can not recommend this game really but if you can get abetter controller it may be worth the time give it a try but the free content be pretty limited and should really be describe as a demo not free to play disappointed as so many race game seem to be aim at the console market codemasters use to produce some fun driving game but now fill their arcade racer with fantasy city track and bore drift course be not that what nfs be for perhaps i will have well luck with ac meanwhile back to grand prix legend ha ha i also find the menu system here really clunky and poorly think out i quickly get bored with the free content and be not charm enough to risk good money on this yet i know it be still in development but it still need a lot of work to get it sweet,neg

early access reviewafter read some of the negative comment i must say it be not as bad as they paint it the game about building vehicle like they be lego and put gun on them and pin your creation against other people creation it be fun satisfaction come from see your creation bust up the creation of other people as you shoot them at the end of the match you return to your mothership to make repair and or change to your ship before the next match repair cost increase the high level you be but you usually earn more than what you loose in repair at high tier it do start dig into your pocket but it create an environment where careful strategy against the enemy become the main focus and not some rambo crazy kamikaze attack because you will literally end up pay for mistake with credit you can use to otherwise upgrade your ship sure there be premium user but that be not a huge deal all they get be block that you can also get with some game time they still have to level up to use enough of them because of the cpu point system so it be not exactly pay2win because i must emphasize that you can get what they can the more you play my favorite part about this game be the physics engine you can not just make any vehicle work out so it be funny see people at spawn flip over onto their back or fly ship go haywire because they can not get good weight distribution overall it be a great game to pick up play for a bit and then do something else you will not regret it oh do i mention it be a free download yeah review update 12 10 2015the game just keep get well and betterrepair cost be go and new part just keep flow in optimization be fantastic and with each update come a fresh breath of air that spice thing up,pos
i would recommend this game to anyone whose be aqcuintate to me a man should be hard robust strong like a tank and the game improvement really bring something in mind see if the thumb up down feature can do something on the match make like if i be worthy opponent so i can battle fight those 7 tank which worthy too also i must say this again and again match make should implement rating system like cs go have you can not no long battle with noob newbs and s anymore if you be a decent player rating like cs go be good it show us what we be and who they be to fight to,pos

after play elsword for some time i would have to recomend this game its not to complicate or need a high power system to run well it follow a simple side scroller hack and slash format like the desc say p at first it may seem complicated at first but it all fall into place after a while my only problem with es be that the quest get boring and repeatative if you be work on many different character you can not get an international group of player on the same server and how the game be update be really unbalanced meaning player in korea have the most update version of the game the us be the second most update and from their it reduce down quite rapidly india have the least update version of the game it would be nice if all contrie get update at the same time but that can be a good thing mean you can look at video from people play in a different country and get sort of a spoileroverall good game easy to learn very addictive only real down side be that not all contrie get update at the same timemy score 9 10 totally worth it,pos

tldr up front have its pro and con as a game but if you be not a loaded and b a super hardcore combat flight simmer for the con it have this game seriously be not worth your money and oh boy you be go to have to fork it up to buy in if you want to know why i think that read on so i have a few hour in the steam version and many many more in standalone i have a handful of module why be i come to steam to make this review despite be a standalone player because see this in steam be what get me to check it out in the first place and i be lucky i get my nose in the community enough to get warn away from the steam version as for the pro of this game there be more than enough glow review of this game to tell you the pro so i be go to focus on why i be not recommend this i will save the problem with the steam version for other negative reviewer in here as they have more skin in the game than me so here go my first gripe with this game be that the actual gaming content just be not there there be no dynamic campaign to speak of what be this 1995 despite dynamic campaign otherwise be the industry standard the mission editor be weak and do not have a big community like armas hammer out content there be almost no professionally develop co op content to speak of multiplayer be lack with the exception of a couple community dynamic campaign and the on rail singleplayer campaign be meh at best yeah flying be fun but if i be look to have fun just fly i would look at a different game i be here to fly high performance aircraft and blow stuff up eagle dynamic ed need to step their game up literally this game deserve much much well content which lead in to my next point that point be that the dlc module aka the plane you buy be obscenely expensive this be a true example of the gillette razor business model they give you the razor for free and they charge your pant off for the blade most of the plane in this game be sweet they be thorough they be model to a great level than pretty much every other civilian simulation out there but when you do not have the content in which to really have fun with these module their intrinsic value drop like a rock you can not convince me to drop 80 buck on an early access f a 18 when aaa title that have solid gameplay from start to finish to post completion be consistently 60 i have bill to pay ed and not everyone that play your game be some kind of filthy rich flight sim snob that have hundred and hundred of dollar to blow on dlc the absurd cost of these dlc module seriously make me think you guy believe that i get that development be expensive but you have to price this stuff at a level that make sense for the consumer and with the state of the gameplay itself it really do not help justify the high cost of these module i be a pretty serious flight simmer i have be at it since i be a little kid and the cost still just do not add up 80 for a plane that i can jack around with in instant action play a campaign that will be fun once and only once hope there be some community develop co op for if i be actually able to get my friend into this game or play multiplayer with a bunch of people i do not know or i can pay 60 for a full feature aaa title that i know be go to be a great time heck i would probably rather just buy a 30 indie title that i know i will lose hundred and hundred of hour in they charge you for the map besides georgia they charge you for wwii asset they charge the crap out of you for the buggy land warfare module they charge you 60 70 for the other top of the line module they charge you for additional campaign assume you already have a great rig to play this on get a hotas and headtracker the minimum require peripheral imo and the price it cost to get the full fidelity plane you want the buy in cost for this game be ridiculous that be not count the cost of plane down the line if you want to get into vr or whatever other side asset like map or vehicle they be go to charge you for that be why i seriously do not recommend this game the cost to fun ratio be seriously not there that be come from a sim aviation enthusiast and a general gaming enthusiast unless you see yourself build an all out sim pit in the future just about any other low fidelity combat flight simulator out there will give you a well time and you actually have a chance to get some of your friend to buy in and play it with you,neg
early access reviewas someone who hate this genre alongside survival game i be very surprised i have be enjoy this game i would not play it alone but with friend it can be good fun once in a while for a few round it be basically pubg in the snow for free the game run mostly good on my old system and the look pretty nice the map be well design and the inclusion of glider and snowboard make for some good fun the gun sound and feel pretty good although they be way too loud right now the game can be insanly loud need some seperate audio slider for car footstep and gun if you be bored have some friend and want something random to play i recommend this otherwise it be just another generic br game,pos
i be pretty new to the game but i just have to make a review thing that i rarely do first i want to talk about the community in my many year of play video game i have rarely encounter such a friendly and welcoming community they embrace me from the beginning and they be really cool when we lose game because of my noobness which be quite often the dev work pretty close to the community most of them be big fan of their own game you will play with them quite often if you wanna team up or you have any question just join the official discord the game be pretty cool too beautiful ship beautiful enviroment and plenty of pew pew and explosion you can get all the ship in the game quite fast just by play the game no hide stop or sneaky micro transaction you can get anything in the game with credit except the skin which still have a chance to drop from cargo box i get 2 this be the pure form of free to play that i have ever see in a game especially in a moba this game be awesome not perfect do not get me wrong it still have some issue and it can be rough around the edge sometimes but you will not even notice it the community be awesome like i say but i still have 1 or 2 bad encounter moron be everywhere and you can not really avoid it but i use that lovely red report button it be a game you should really try nothing to lose only to gain sorry for the horrible formatting and the huge block of text d,pos
one thing you need to know be perhaps in 800 of the 1000 room absolutely nothing be happen once you realize that the game completely lose its horror thus while in the beginning i be nervous that fade away and the game become simply boring and tedious while i can see how many people sincerely enjoy this game unfortunately i have to say that i feel more like it waste my time with me wait for something cool to happen,neg

early access reviewths game be a lot of fun and the combat be usually pretty competitive all be fine until the epic loot update and they remove the rb reward for match use to buy whatever part you want and replace by a random drop system the random drop system be not fun at all since you can play for a good while without ever get part you will actually use and instead get a ton of useless part you then recycle them at 1 10th of the part value and end up get maybe 1 usefull part per 10 to 20 match i totally recommend this game as it be fun but be prepared to be incentivize more than ever to buy premium status and even with premium you still get that sad random drop system because that be such a turn off for me i have to give a thumb down to the game at this point i really really hope they will bring back the rp system and if they ever do i will be extremely happy to review this review,neg

early access reviewi be actually play this game before it come to steam when it be all do through a browser so my timing on the game may be short but that be because i be a long time player before steam release so i originally get into this game as an alpha before steam hit back then the game be start out and come a long way since then graphic the graphic be actually quiet good and overal a nice touch on the game with some cool effect and detailing when in battle and not control these actually take some get use too i find the character control to be slightly annoying but then that could be the kinda sim feel to the game i think but it do take some time to get use too so be warn audio the game be basically wwii sound and so on i must say some of the sound in the game be really good and spot on with detail and worth have it loud now the game and it be feature would you say the game be pay to win yes with what i see in the game it be very easy to buy some of the good stuff and just run around kill stuff quickly you also get a few idiot in the game that just mess around in the middle of battle which be highly annoying but then in the middle of a battle you see a guy on a pushbike riding past a tank rather amusing and enjoyable even though there that kinda pay to win aspect of the game you can earn the stuff in the game still as it just take some more time to get there so that be annoying but then be a very enjoyable game i can not really doubt it because the game be very fun and mixed with the graphic which be very detailed i would say full look around massive plus would i recommend the game yes and no and the only no be the pay to win on the game but everything else be yes without a doubt a free to play wwii shooter basically an update bf1942 game with kinda more,pos

to be fair you can get through the vast majority of the game upto levl 60 without spend a penny in real money i only start think i may need to buy item at a much later stage in the game as pvp at level 60 be pretty hard and its cleara lot of the guy have pay stuff which give them a massive advantage however i pvpd right upto to 60 on a competitive level with armour and weapon gain freely neverwinter be a enjoyable game if you be willing to put the time into it its not one of them game you can dip into for 1 hour and expect to be draw in craft your characer will take considerable time and effort and in some case do tedious quest over and over its a very in depth game with lot of angle too many infact but in a way that give the game a long life span as there be always something new to do graphically the game be quite nice but can get laggy on even the good of pc most likely due to server congestion overall i would recommend people try this game but be prepared to put more than a few hour into it to see its ful potential,pos

after 2100 hour of play this game my recommendation be to never even try to play the game it be fill with toxic player racist player and trolls the problemis that valve will never fix this or ban them do not let anyone rope you in to play this game true you will enjoy it till your life be dominate by abusive player racist player feeder and troll i have never see a game where a player just jump right inb and his pair with way more experienced player and do not even know what his ultimate power do if it be just that it would have be fine but no you have to deal with racist and bigot that harass you because of who you be i can not count how many time my religion have make someone follow me about and call me name till i disconnect from the game because the harassment be too much and guess what valve punish me for leave a game where i be be harass valve support racist and troll do not even get me start on the ranked system that be no different that litter with cheater and toxic element it be also rig to benefit their so call pro player take my advice and play another game this game be bad for your health valve will not fix the matchmaking do not deceive yourself and oh it take 30mins to queue up for a game,neg

first thing first the game be controversial do not get fool by my playtime combine with my time use the soe launcher my gametime go into multiple thousand of hour so here my advise if u wanna go alone and just grind gun stay away from it you will find the grind tedious you will be outgunne by people who be bad than you but win because they gang up on you i be not say u can not have fun in the game go solo from time to time i do so myself the actual joy come in when you become part of a team do not matter if you be an elitist in your small squad of energdrinking doritoeating memelord or you be be a small part of a way big machine play continent wide king of the hill while do so the cert u need for all of your upgrade will come along the way actual review overview we have here an mmofps in which u can play one of three faction or all of them that emphasive the management of population and the right form of deployment in a nutshell when u be bring 12 guy deploy as light infantry and you be go against 48 player go at you combine arm style you be in for a rough ride and should question the sanity of your squadlead when two army be manage properly and be go at each other then you be in for an experience that be unrivaled across all game i be aware of the faction you can play be suppose to be asymetricly balanace but in reality the only realy difference be the gunsound with a different gimmick here and there to make a perfectly inaccurate statement nc hit hard fire slow tr have big magazine vs have fast reload speed and no bullet drop the bullet drop be not so handy though graphic and optimization the graphic age well the game be from 2012 and on ultrasetting u will get some cool visual however the optimization be far from perfect so u need a decent rig to able to play the game on low setting its recommend for all lowend rig to completely turn of shadow and light effect gunplay this game use clientside if you do not know what that mean pls use google before you read on the ttk when play infantry vs infantry be pretty high 6 8 hit there be a lot of shiny thing u can use use to upgrade you class but they be not of any use if u do not understand clientside people camp in corner will be in a disadvantage in this game also because of the high ttk infantry combat be relatively close quarterish compare with other game vehiclegameplay i will not go into ground vehicle here since well everyone know what they can expect from them there be tank armour trooptransport and what have ya not that different from what already exist irl however the airgame be different from u may have experience in other game the fly vehicle in the game all kind of act like attack helicopter this be due to the ability to hover that all airvehicle have this turn dogfight into helicopter battle where the combatant usually face each other instead of get on the six of one another if u wanna be more than cannonfodder in the air you also need lot of practice since the more advanced manouver be not really intuitive and need practice there be some good vid on youtube for that psw there be nothing currently avaiable in the game that can not be earn through just play the game however camos and other cosmetic be only drop when u win an alert and its a random drop so if u really wanna have a certain shiny thing on your armor u may help out your grandpa in the garden and invest the money u get there in shinys all other thing can be aquire by certification point that u get every 250 xp point or so as state above if you be just play this game for the grind while also go solo u will have a hard time to aquire the cert u want to unlock the much need upgrade on you utility slot general advise the basic gun u get to start with be the most versatile invest your first cert in the actual class abilite and slot will upgrade your char more than a 1k cert gun that u just buy because some good player use it there be implant in the game that can be buy in lootboxes with cert or with real cash i think the mechanic be problematic but the implant be not these implant give you tiny or nice to have gimmic that improve the qulity of life but do not make you inherently strong you can have the good implant in the game when you do not know how to clientside u still get rekt it be worth note here that if the main continent the one with most population often have a queue to get into if u play the faction with most population if u aquire membership also give a bit more xp u will be treat with priority i can not give definitive answer here since i guess that the whole psw need more definition i can tolerate it,pos

early access reviewlet us do it really short because i do not wanna put too much time into review a game that be pretty much still in developement and have not too many complex feature 1 be this game an innovative battle royal well i would say it be a very fresh new touch to the variety of br game that be release over the last 2 year or so it have some nice new mechanic start kit and bring a very interesting zone mechanism with a unique end game 2 be this a good game ignore the fact i have list above this game honestly need some decent polishing before i would even bother comment on the quality of the game in general there be some main issue desync fp some graphical glitch that will probably be work on very soon it be pretty much as good bad in term of stability as pubg and i obviously have to make this comparison with few fps but less desync and drop and the handling feel a bit smooth overall graphic be pretty neat same bad texture for some object and terrain as in pubg roe also have some really good qol feature that certainly make it a bit more casual than pubg but also more enjoyable from my pov e g scope swaping auto attach etc 3 be this a fun gamel yes snowboard climbing zipline paragliding it be a lot of fun in term of dynamic gameplay and movement over the map the gunplay be decent gun feel solid but recoil be pretty much absent you also get hitmarkers 4 would i recommend this game yes it be free and it be more casual and more entertaining than pubg imho so go ahead download it and give it a try you will not regret it it be especially enjoyable with friend glide in a 4 man squad or show off your good ssx snowboard move while get to the next zone close wordswith some time and good decision make by tencent game this will soon be a gem and probably overtake pubgs daily player count on steam it be like a mix of a casual pubg and a more mature fortnite without fort and with a lot of snow thank for read and have a lot of fun with roe,pos
the combat system in this game be stupid the visual be not representative of what be actually determine the outcome of the combat it be just time base like everything else in this game here be an example if you have 2 people shoot at 3 radroache the roach will die at random time even when your people be not shoot at them and your people will suffer damage overtime by the enemy just be in the room with them the equipment and weapon you stick on your people just improve these time but there be no real combat even go on in this game and this be what i think the meat of the game could have be but everything in this game be just timer timer timer nothing at all else not the combat or the exploration building or relationship between your people it be all just timer and randomness its lazy game design,neg
early access reviewi absolutely love the game i do not know why so many of you be complain i think the majority of you be just jump on the bandwagon like s to hate on this game just because this be not their first time of release i have no connection issue whatsoever or other issue the only thing that bother me be the fps which i believe will be fix by the dev even so have 40 60 fps be not a huge problem for play a mmorpg game it be not a competitive shooter like cs go lol you either have a pc or a network do not blame the dev my wi fi isbut the game run just fine on na server keep in mind that i be live in korea off the bandwagon loser,pos
early access reviewokay okay let me just get this right they take away the level up system where everyone have a fair opertunity to grow themself and level up to get strong and better they take away the gc and rc and replace it with crap now a brand new player can win a seeker or high level weapon and wreck everyone wat the fun in that go back to the old system and keep it that way why break something that s work so if you want to get this game make sure your ready to be dissapointed,neg

when i start this game i do not know what to expect i start run into the grassy field in front of me and find nothing even after 20 minute i question this walk simulator however crouch down and start walk much slow a few minute later i hear a deer call and be a novice simply walk toward it i do not know yet that you be equip with a tracker that locate where the deer be i pull out my rifle and scope in to the general vicinity that i believe the deer to be shortly i see it in my sight i take careful aim fired and completely miss the deer run away and i do not get a kill that hunt all in all i absolutely adore this game the gorgeous wild beauty mix with the enjoyable tracking and hunting of your animal make this game incredibly fun for me at least see this game be not a game where you get kill every other minute this be a game in which up to hour of time climaxes in one moment where you have your animal in your sight if you blow the shot you can expect a minimum of 20 30 minute either track the same animal down or look for a different beast all together another thing about this game that put people off be the price tag although the game itself be f2p you have to buy hunting license for all animal expect the whitetail deer furthermore the only viable way to get equipment such as deer odor to conceal your scent from the deer or a tent to start your hunt at a place which you place your tent in previous hunt alongside rifle shotgun and handgun be to pay occasionally large sum of real money for some this be the ultimate turn off i believe it to be irritating that you have to pay for this content however i be still content with the game itself see what i do there 9 10 for a solid realistic and accurate hunting game with a few flaw,pos
early access reviewwell supposedly i have play this for 557 hrs all i do be leave my laptop run for day on end i forget about it anyways the game be fun because you get to build a robot and shoot other robot from what i gather from other review it have a pay to play feature which i highly dislike it take a ton of time to get anywhere and you be pair with random people not at all in your skillset compare to what you have build unlocked so it could be a fun game but really it be just frustrating,neg

my favorite hunting simulation its not cheap and its not free to play you can however play it like a demo you get one weapon and 2 3 animal to hunt but to really enjoy then game you have to buy a time membership and alot of stuff from the ingame shop which be quite expensive but for that you get the good hunting sim out there they constantly add new map reserve animal and gun so if you willing to pay for it you get a lot of fun at least if you be a patient gamer hunting be a lot of wait if you really want to invest money in it i hardly suggest buy one of the shotgun first with nearly all of them you have a weapon which be allow to hunt every animal in the game watch some let play and read some forum post for more information so i really enjoy this game and can suggest it to any gamer interested in a hunting game have fun,pos

pay to win i like it for a hot second but then i find out how cheap it be if you just buy the overly expensive item what be the point in strategy if you can just pay to automaticly have more money and health per round decrease your opponent health by 2 every 15 second weaken all bloon on your side by one level automaticly and transfer bloon on your side to theirs with add camo and or lead upgrade that s all one tower that can be your if you just buy 5000 coin even if i buy money for this game i would not use something like that no game should have something that break and bad a lot of people i find do it when a match be even it be fun but it be not when you have the chance for a instant lose would recommend otherwise but not with that in the game,neg

early access reviewi m not familiar with this third person strategy genre but i can tell you this be a good title the space ship model look amazing due to the unreal engine 4 the big ship feel heavy as they should in real life you need some practice with this game but the menu control be pretty good you get familiarize with the key pretty soon and start to enjoy the last part of the tutorial advanced battle even more i haven t check the game online cause i need friend who own this title to play 5 vs 5 and this be where the game must really shines unfortunately my pc spec be in the low section and i m quite sure you need a good system for that kind of multiplayer the lack of single player mission be the downside here i bet they can add randomly generate mission arcade style and campaign mode soon remember that the game be at early access so they re probably consider those option i enjoy the in game tutorial a lot i be glad i download the game for free just hope this game will not turn into a money machine 9 10,pos
early access reviewi guess after they fail the game twice it be about time to milk the west i wish that the coreean dev realise that we be not go to eat thisanymore and we be not the rich relative across the ocean who put 100 buck in your pocket while you can not even wash your socket the game be terrible at many aspect it have an outdated engine stupid combat system totally unatractive story and lore instance and the claustrofobic feeling that you be walk on a small map even if the world be huge be just on paper be actually compose of many small place tie together buy it at your own risk but i be write this as a statement for you all stop support the asian developer be time they learn to threat the western market with respect and deliver good and finished product at the price that they would normally practice in their country respect the buyer or sell yoyrto the russians,neg

i have never really write a review for any game on steam but this game break that mold in fact it break lot of mold in the moba genre in all its a moba game that use a third person camera at all time while this may seem like a quirky gimmic that make the game uninteresting in a few moment of gameplay it do not it always keep my attention and i waste hour play this game without even realise it and that s the thing whenever i try to play any other moba game dota 2 league of legend i get bore quickly because i feel like the action just be not there this game on the contrary be always fill with excitment and i be always on my toe when i play this game all of the basic attack be what s call skill shot mean you have to aim in order to kill anyone in this game unlike other moba game you do not click on the ground to move instead you move with the wasd key and you have to option to re bind them to something else currently the game have about 69 god to play as from different pantheon god be essentially your character that you can choose to play as or a champion if you will and they all look and sound great hell the entire game look amazing even when everything be turn down on low the game mode vary from conquest 5v5 to joust 3v3 and if that be not enough you have a motd or a mode of the day which should add a little something to your life if you ever get bored of classic 5v5 a motd be a random mode with the rule change whether it be extra money or all one character or a mode where everyone be already to the max level in the end i could keep go about how amazing this game be i have play this for like a gazillion hour before it even come to steam or i could just end on say if you want to try a moba game that s a little diffrent but still fun smite be your game,pos
look for that good old neverwinter night feel but in an mmo format then you will be sorely disappoint i conclude very quickly that this title be neverwinter in name alone where the long since establish d d rule system and mechanic be no where in sight hence i do not play for very long out of blind disappointment instead of the second come we get this weird mix of modern action orientate combat apparently borrow mechanic and idea from a wide range of similar game and throw them haphazardly into a boil pot of lore loosely base on the beloved neverwinter night game and d d universe where this game have a chance to shine though be through it be surprisingly complex and complete quest creation system there be a metric tonne of player create quest here for well or bad some be really well write and think out while other be painfully incomplete and outright boring would i recommend it if you be familiar with the role of be a gamemaster or just love to create story this may just be the game for you if you be look for yet another f2p mmo in which to kill thing this may be the game for you if you be look for a solid neverwinter night d d experience keep look tl dr leave your love and expectation of d d at the door and you should be fine,pos
early access reviewhonestly i give the game another shot but after do some research i be disappoint at neowiz as a company yes its an early access game but they hold back on all the end game content and do not even fix bug that should have be fix before release they advertise falsely say that these feature would be here come early access release i may wind up ask for a refund know they do not deliver on there advertise end game content because this be a company i can not trust at this point,neg

early access reviewthis game be once a lot of fun however after 1 year the game have be completely destoye by improvement update this game have become a full on pay to win it use to be about skill to unlock part but now its if you be lucky enough with loot crate and increase your chance with premium i use to have an awesome tech tree level system and player matching but now its all but be destroy so the dev can make more money by force you to buy premium to have fun,neg
early access reviewbore slow and a waste of time even for a open beta it be expensive to level up and you need many hour to level up and get more gun the game be slow even with premium the game be fun for 20 minute you can not see your target when aim down sight it take a lot of hour to level up full of bug even for a open beta do not play before a stable version be realease unless boringness be your hobby,neg

early access reviewi love play this game recommend it to all my friend even with add the unbalanced wweapon i stick with it but these lame loot crate be where i draw the line you have make it impossible for people to customize the bot the way they want if they sell the block you give them which i do not blame them be mostly inner and random shield you lose half your meager profit from even a good match seriously 60 random block and a number 5 shield from a platinum crate level 105 battle arena victory total maybe 1000 1500 robit which be a tenth or less of the old reward after conversion,neg
ok so i download this game despite the 3 000 and some odd number of negative review and to my surprise there it be not a free to play not a free to play with slight premium buy but a pay to win then after 3 or so month pay to win again as soon as i load the game up the first screen that pop up be the purchase screen so this tell me that this be nothing but a milk machine for the skeezy developer that make this and once i get past that i actually get into the game and what do you know i start with nothing but my hand and a camera so upon further investigation of the get a gun situation i find that i have to exit the game entirely and go to the launcher to get equip with something so i know that be a free to player i would not get the good but i get the absolute bad i get some crappy gun that look like it be texture in ps2 era and i still have to buy ammo which cost in game currency so i go to buy some and nope i get no start cash so basically it be try to force me to pay up to get some in game currency so i could purchase ammo for a free gun i feel like this should be label as a bad game and take off steam due to the 3 000 some odd number negative review say it be a horrible game and nothing but a scheme to rob people i be go to try and contact the developer to see if i do something wrong and how i can fix it and i may change my review,neg
early access reviewthe game strucuture be good also the graphic would like to see a clear interface and i do not like the idea of have premium point because f2p suck make a good pay game out of it and this could be a new hit another point that i do not like be the speed of the spaceship you should have like a boost to have this i speed up feeling but all together this be a solid early access game greeting,pos

frankly you would have to be in a coma to not want to try the game see as it be totally free of charge regardless of your first impression from review give it a whirl as you probably already know planetside 2 be all about fighting in huge battle with dozen or hundred of player simultaneously in a persistent world compose of three four continent which be roughly 8 x 8 km large indar semiarid desert esamir freeze tundra amerish lush mountain range and in the come summer hossin overgrown swamp you can take control of a soldier from the totalitarian terran republic tr who rely heavily on conventional weapon with high rate of fire and quick vehicle cover with a red black color scheme in addition there be the new conglomerate nc freedom fighter who rely on high recoil gauss weapon and slow move gameplay all saturate with blue gold paint then there be the vanu sovereignty vs who have purple and teal alien energy weapon and a variety of special trait over the other two the battle the three faction fight across the continent be a ton of fun with the large battle claim the life of dozen of player in a few second with the battle themselves last hour or rarely day the game lighting which be unbelievably good take a look at the night sky when player be shoot flak at aircraft make the fight visually spectactular with huge explosion and tracer round make even small fight hard to miss the sound be also extremely good with the thundering of war and explosion with the whirr of bullet fly past your head provide unmatched immersion in an fps the game have five basic infantry class the combat medic who do what you think he do the engineer who set up turret supply ammo and repair thing infiltrator who can hack enemy terminal and equipment lay mine and cloak heavy assault who blow up fortification and vehicle with hmgs and rocket launcher and have resist shield finally there be the light assault who have a jetpack and annoy people in addition to the above there be also a set of powered battle armour call the max suit that player can equip that enable them to trash enemy of all kind for a price those infantry can use a large selection of cross faction and faction specific vehicle like the air superiority fighter main battle tank and ifv which keep the battle mobile and dangerous they be also a lot of fun to use for obvious reason ever run over a 20 strong platoon of soldier in a tank i have not everything be peachy however though nothing be bad the size of the game and other technical hurdle leave it unable to support high quality texture on par with todays gold standard with its graphic be roughly equivalent to 2011s good although the art style offset this somewhat the game historically poor performance and optimization have be more or less fixed but the game be still somewhat taxing on old computer if your rig be old than say three year you will have to fiddle with some setting there be some balance issue with faction specific vehicle and weapon but most be relatively minor and the few that be not be not have be patch the current metagame i e a sense of accomplishment and permanence to your action be rather lack at the moment with the continent swinge wildly from 90 vs control to 80 nc to 70 tr very little territory in the game stay with your faction for more than a few day this should be fix when hossin be release when they will release continent lattice which will enable team to totally conquer the game world certification the in game currency you earn by get experience point be somewhat slow to accumulate so if you be plan on get good gear several hour of gameplay be the minimum requirement you also can not purchase in game cosmetic item with cert you must buy them with real money other even more minor thing be present but none not even the one i describe be really a hinderance by any stretch the game be an absolute joy to play even if you do not put any money into it and it offer an expeience you can not get anywhere else i award this game a great 8 10 a definite download for fan of the fps genre d,pos

not only at how many hour i have now but base on how many i have play even before steam release i think i can write a honest review first of all this be a great game with lot of potential that be why i have be play it for quite a time but the developer on this game decide to make it even more painfull for new or begin player to enjoy the game as you know in this game you can buy item with game dollar gc and bandage dx in the late patch of januari they decide to remove the dx as a currency and all dx above 10000 be exchange for game dollar which make it almost impossible to buy sniper or gear from the store because of the ridiculous high price second of all they reduce drop from super zombie and from loot crate etc it be hard to get loot not only because the pve server be always full and rent a private server have be disable for over 3 4 month but because once you spawn in all the people be full gear clan from 3 to 11 people have train skilltree so they have a small advantage have well weapon or attachment to kill you easily with that be say about adventage the big adventage be that it be pay to win you can buy credit with real money exchange it for skin or skinboxes or dx trade it for all kind of gear and tadaaa you now have a full global inventory and you never need to worry about lose item that be not the game it use to be and it be really sad to see it have come to this i hope i make clear why you should not invest time or money in this game as it only reward you with an empty global inventory or an empty wallet small summary of pro and con pro cool and unique pvp clan system be unique killstreak be be reward with more cash reputation system reward you for kill bandit or rep or give you negative rep if you kill civilian or rep you can find all sort of item across map con really low and small loot for a server like this no sniper and almost no crate too many clan or friend team up every server there be different pvp city spawn in an other map teleport your character to a new random location you can never use 1 character on multiple map without spawn at a random locatian everytime you spawn pay to win all advantage you get for be premium be just too many skill cap be too high you have beginner server but only someone with 0 kill and below 72 hour can play on it premium server pvp with car yes i know it be e but the hitbox be just so big hacker and lagger all over the place have not i say enough to convice you not to play this game anyway i hope this review help you consider to play this game yes or no thank for read,neg
this game make me so frustrated it have pro and con and if tend to could be so much well for player and producer after play various character reach endgame this be my conclusion pve amazing tho a bit linear still have good story and quest compare to allot of other grind out there i enjoy many of the zone and contrary to many critic on vioce acting i do not find it too bad which be hardwork consider it be f2p combat be fun and fast pace not too easy not to hard and allow for some room to make character build and if you have friend to play with and choose not to pay money to climb this game could be very extensive on pve term the foundry be one of the good aspect of the game it do not take a computer science degree to understand the fundamental to allow for campaign creation however it do go down quite often which be unfortunate pvp sigh this be the most damaging aspect of the game it have the potential to be great but anyone who play who have not sunke 1k real money into will admit be break unbalanced and pure p2w literally post upon post will say the same thing without a change unless pvp be fix the competetive fan base will dwindle like a candle as it be already and continue until go but in overall opinion it be a fair f2p game but have the potential to be one of the good if handle better,pos
this game be amaze its one of those game that never get old they just keep add more thing to it and its be not a pay to win game some people say it be a pay to win game but i strongly disagree,pos
r3e be really a terrific racing sim it be perhaps launch too early with many feature lacking or function badly but recently though still in beta it have really deliver in my opinion i also have the other two contemporary racing game ac and pc and i must say that i find r3e most fun of these three for example i think bmw m1 procar be even more fun to drive in r3e than it be in pc which i find a blast in pc also r3e be not perfect at least yet but it surely have its strength sound be just awesome and with the recent 9 gb patch they get even well ffb be also good of the three game and it deliver the road feel really well and do not even require hour of tinker with setting to get it right ai be also the most competent of the three by a big margin so r3e be perhaps the good choice for the single player at least until ac and pc improve their ai algorithms graphic be also quite good although not on par with pcar but on the other hand r3e run also very well on my three monitor setup but hey physics be the most important thing no here r3e fare also well physics be not perhaps the most accurate on the planet but still very believable and with awesome ffb i like the driving feel a lot i say it again i think r3e deliver the most fun experience of the three still r3e be by no means arcade racer and lean heavily towards simming side of the genre as say and at the time of writing r3e be still in beta and a work in progress it be still quite polished and offer pretty much full experience already it have no weather or full night but it be otherwise pretty much a full deal imo thing i dislike the most be annoy load time which surely improve with the late patch but be still on the annoying side especially on the menu micropayment system be completely a matter of opionion and it really do not bother me you can have just one experience set and that give you several track and a class of car and that be basically all you need if you want more different pack give good value for money and you get discount for the pack of the item you already may own if you like sim like racing game do not hesitate to try the r3e you can do it for free but of course with very limited option for drive,pos
i love this game even though this game practicaly cost a100 you stil get a great game for not pay the dlc i have lot of fun play it also how be this a adventure a shooter and fps,pos
well smite be moba game that come ou in 2012 and in 2015 get onto steam this time it be all about myhtological god and it position itself as moba that have the third person style gameplay instead of feel like warcraft 3 leftover and yea they keep update it shame that nu wa be not snake babe anymore though nothing that cost money seem to affect gameplay unless unlock god the game also come with easy anticheat with set me off at first after all it be offer separately on steam just for counter strike where it often conflict with valve vac and also take screenshot of your desktop apparently it do it only for cs and everybody else be safe at least it close properly when you close smite aha antiviruse may not like it when instal and set up the game though and well i think that be it be just go to be a generic moba with a camera slap behind the character but nope while there be not much of difference when play melee attack character still be able to hit just one single target and all anything range be a different story you actually have to aim this alone make it much well than dota alike as far as i care there be no warcraft 3 magically home projectile at least for normal attack the ability also have various hit area whether a circle or a line as example there be this neith who have mighty jiggle physics and best ever victory animation her first ability be penetrative arrow first you have have to aim this line down and use the ability after that neith will aim the bow now allow you to change the angle anymore however you be still free to move and thus you be still able to reposition yourself in order to hit the target of course enemy player be not afraid of strafe you slow down when attack so watch out plus a lot of ability be rather smart be something simple yet with multiple usage such as ice elemental tankie golem thing be able to create ice wall have a long range to set it up also the game have jump but it be just a silly animation for those who feel bother not be able to jump when control the character directly developer do not want it to affect gameplay unless exploit or bug the terrain be all flat anyway the game also include the auto feature for both shopping and select ability on level up the latter be not that much need the auto shopping on another hand help new player to just focus on interact with other and fighting when they be not sure if game be worth of their time spend look at all the stat and numerical detail pretty great albeit of course it be not as good as manual build otherwise of course it still have that moba feel it still have tower and creep run along lane the combat flow be still pretty funny in a silly sense at one moment player be attempt to poke each other at range and then in another situtaion they all gang up on each other and nuke area with ability spam in 10 second but hey the game also come with many various mode usual moba big map with three lane the two lane one one lane with small sideway a simple linear path which have random hero selectable about as dumb as deathmatch mode in team game and a small arena mode something for everyone taste otherwise yep the only moba i shall care about so far even if it be not pure moba so that mean that i still sorta do not like mobas but hey whatcha go to do also music rock,pos

i just can not stop play this game great for pro but have a lot of use for casual player too with online play that be always different due to the huge variety of playable character god from various pantheon,pos
early access reviewamaze better than i think it would be if the developer put their heart into this game this game may become as popular as pubg and fortnite didedit lol 94 of the fanbase abandon the game there be no hope of this game get popular now,pos
early access reviewthe game seem good so far one thing i hope be in the complete game be the soulweaver class from dragonfable it be my favorite class to play as and could be a lot of fun in aq3d,pos
i can not tell you how many time i have die in this game and feel not a thimble of anger there be a realism to this game in the sense that you be one soldier of many many other that be wage firefight spread out over a ginormous map there be nothing bind you anywhere other than loyalty to your cause and a will to do what you need to for your faction to secure the target or defend it the openness of be a soldier without order be very liberating and the albeit insanely steep learning curve for accurate shooting and vehicle use lead to immense satisfaction when score a kill or just survive a battle i suggest you play this with a group of friend in the same faction build a squad and use your teamwork as an advantage in battle most other player be lone wolf and can either be pick off when not in a pack or simply outgunne if you walk a tight knit squad down the street with somebody cover every angle and teamspeak run so you know exacly what be go on overall a great game i consider it a benchmark f2p,pos

possibly one of the bad flight sim i ever play do not play it mouse control be totally unusuable keyboard control be quite fancy there be no skill or maybe only by joystick player do not try it yet just luck also the shooting method be quite strange if you want a good mmo flight sim just buy il 2 or lomac and fly online,neg
i start off hate this game due to its massive learning curve and quite frankly that be a good thing to hate about it some people do not want to dedicate a lot time of to one game that be understandable i put 10 15hrs into it across a few week and then uninstalle it a year later i jump back into the game and give it an actual try they add a tutorial after i finish that learn a few thing along the way i start play easy bot practice with a few easy hero the game less complicated than it be on surface once you get go certain thing quickly become easy however certain thing take a long time to learn which be where its learning curve come into play that be where a lot of people include myself at a point be put off by this game lol be an easy alternative but once you break past those first few horrible death fill match of you be confuse as hell and make a ton of mistake the game really start to shine you see the depth the game contain the tactic you start to get suck in if you be anything like me you start find hero that suit your taste that be where the game shine once you have put about 30hrs in you be probably bored of bot match so public match here you come this be where the game be the good and also where it be the bad the game can get very intense if you be with the right people a lot of teamwork will come into play but especially for a newbie this be where the game be at it be bad the community in this game be among the bad i have ever see you will be yell at for make minor or major mistake for some reason they do not realise you be new and they be to at some point you have to start somewhere with dota so with all of the above in mind do you want to start,pos
early access reviewthis be an amazing game not think buy sure it have a learning curve but you will be able to dogfight in spaceship dota style,pos
worst free to play game i ever see if you want invest 200 you can enjoy this hardcore walking simulator seriously even a concentration camp be more enjoyable than this game,neg
potentially hundred of player fight over a single location epic squad action for your 12 to 48 close friend near endless upgrade option for free i guess you could spend a few minute play casually be warn even though this game be release back in 2012 it still require a beefy pc setup to run smoothly and even then it be a bit of a cpu hog then again eye candy can always be drop in exchange for some close quarter shoot smoothness just like you do with cs back in the day,pos
terrible graphic terrible gameplay terrible handling i download this after read all the positive comment but the car drive like they be float on air not the track,neg
early access reviewit be a really cool looking game but with a hell of a learning curve i will definitely be come back once the alpha have be complete and more tutorial and documentation have be add the minute to minute play be fun i just really have no idea what be actually go on,pos
hahaha i be surprised to see this on steam consider it be originally a little in browser thing it be an amusing little waste of time probably will not hold your attention for too long but it be fun for what it be so go ahead and check it out if you have get a few hour to kill,pos
i want to use this as a gun encyclopedia but it have progression for just take apart gun i tinker with this for awhile and wonder if i would even be able to take apart the gun i be interested over all if you do not want to spend money on this do not waste time if you want this as something to do when yuo bored consider get this but do not get this if you be try to take apart a specific gun edit just ignor this game in general,neg
early access reviewpros immersive world crafting make sense and be need combat be fun guild play an important role in the game later oncon a lot of the content from jp be yet to be release so you have to be patient if you be intend to buy this do not expect a finished game it be early access as it say if you can live with it i suggest buy it some feature be redundant and not appropriate imho being able to pay in game currency to teleport to dungeon for example summary i genuinely enjoy the game nevertheless i do not think that it be something for the mass market and for player that be use to play mainstream mmo,pos
early access reviewthe game be basically in an alpha stage with how imbalanced the combat be how clunky it feel and how much content be miss maybe come back if this game last long enough for everything to be fix and balance i can not support this game nor recommend this game to anyone until the many issue this game have be fix,neg
i have click my way through a lot of game eventually i always hit a point where the game just stop offer content and be all about number which be when i move on adventure and heroclicker come to mind this one i be literally baffle by how much there be to do and how instead of simply give you a new thing to buy to progress to further tier they give you multiple tool instead what make this game unique be you make build of course some build be well than other but for someone not interested in copy other people it be incredibly fun example relatively early you unlock mercenary they can literally pick any passive from any faction and any two spell but zauren do not that potentially create incredibly op setup yes yes it do and the game intend you to do them and i be constantly refine my merc build or try new one my one regret be start play during an event and now it feel so slow give me back my summer bonus p s autoclicker not require they actually cap autoclick anyway you can and there be a faction around manual clicking but it be not important and that be major to me update still go strong i be bored to tear at this point in hero clicker and still be maybe halfway through the content dragon be finally mine neutral be supreme once more cower mortal,pos
