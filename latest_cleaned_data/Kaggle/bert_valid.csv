one of my new favorite game i spam play this when i first download it and have play it everyday since its story be interesting and enjoyable in game purchese be also obtainable by in game currency you can earn daily for most item it be not pay to win it be fun and worth a download,pos
the only reason i do not recommend smite be that it have become very unbalanced over the year and very few good player if any player at all play the game matchmaking take 5 minute to find a game as i have to wait a full half hour to get a conquest match as for the game be unbalanced a handfull of god that have be falsely declaire weak or lack recieve unneeded buff some god who recieve no change already be too strong and can last in a 1v5 fight and most likely win one example be baskura that can use his ult to nuke an entire team with little or no chance of the enemy win another be the morigan as a squishie wort nightmare this mage will sneak up on you without any warning or sight from a ward and kill you instantly and who dosnt love chalk chalk chak whatever this one will tower dive you kill you and a teammate leave heal up to full with his rain and do it all over again no problem and that s my rant,neg
do not even bother with this game the picture make it look like the graphic be great but on high all and ultra all they look like absolute crap this be not a zombie survivial game it be a walking simulator,neg
early access reviewpros i like that arcady and fast style of the game its goofy i like the special powerup thing f e this kneepad of speed the map be nicecon strange character movement imense and nearly uncontrollable recoil lead to shotgun and sniper become the only controllable weapon also kind of weird recoil weapon jump down instead of up after shoot first person be shet prop like the cigarette block ur view in general the camera be to low third person be ok but when you be spectate a teammate your camera be further away you can ghostin my opinion its more of an unfinished battleroyale game which want to mock the genre of br than a real competitor to all the other br game platypussi,neg
i see many people complain about the game be pay to play now i will not lie here it indeed be it be still possible to play this game without put any money on it but then you will have to put a lot more of time on it because the grinding will become much more intense and need other than that i think this game be really nice enjoyable and addicting if you really do get into it be warn at one point you will die and you will get frustrated but then again death be part of the game if you really want to progress in the game,pos
free to play without pay to win regularely get new free content as extension nice variety of environment dynamic boss battle solo or coop with friend there be no excuse to not at least give it a try if you like hack slay game,pos
  if you be look to have fun and be a normal person i do not recomend this game this be a quote from another review here on steam fortunately i be not a normal person and i do not want to have fun so this game be perfect for me a combat flight simulator with downright excessive attention to detail and realism i can adjust the air conditioning in my plane why would i want to i do not know but i can,pos

this critically acclaimed game be the sequel to the new york good seller minecraft this game have rpg element that be reminiscent to game like runescape club penguin and shower with your dad simulator do you still shower with you dad it be graphic be hit to an old generation with some graphical nod to pong and call of duty ghost this game be easy to get into with a great tutorial and fun and accept community you will be sure to make new steam friend fast and the developer be constantly help with bug fix and great new dlc there be 4 dragon to choose from each with their own unique play style 1 the bruiserdo not let this dragon appearance fool you this dragon love a greatand will easily become your good friend he can take approximately 3 hit before faint it be damage be high but can only shoot one fire ball every 30 minute it be customization consist of new eye the colour of it be ear wax and the shape of it be nostril overall choose this class if you be into a quick stealthy class much like dr egg man from sonic and mario in the olympic games2 the healerthis dragon can only move if something need healing so prepare to bring your razor because you will be need to cut yourself to lead this dragon unlike it be name it actually have no healing capability it can breath air and can move at the speed of a young child he like long walk on the beach romantic movie and dog you can buy paint as dlc and colour it be nail this add 20 agility and 10 fletching3 the wizardthis unique dragon have the ability to bend the space time continuum and change reality as we know it this power be somewhat under power as this would still take 5 hit to kill a simple protector of time the aoe of this attack be high but it be damage be slow only 12 000 hp per hit this be nothing compare to the gnome childs def of 154 nothingif you be go for a bloodborne game play style this dragon be for you it be completely invisible because nothing there it have no attack and no defense when play this game mode be sure not to die because it be one life and you be dead the developer even add a special bonus that if you die in the game you die in real life it be so realistic that it actually feel if you be get a knife stick in you there be no customization because there be no dragon overall this game appeal to every audience and it be ask price of nothing be still way too much it be dlc be worth it though a proper 9 10 could have use more dragon yiffing,pos
early access reviewafter a few hour play and reach level 10 i know it be not a lot of time but i have to decide refund or waste money also this game have be release in other region and have fail there miserably 60mil go into make it and it feel like they be try to get some money back for the investor the game feel and look old and unfinished it be from 2012 and it show the ui be dreadfull open something and the game hang some thing do not even work market combat feel lack yes it be well then it be before but have no normal attack feel weird also not be able to dodge and the lag attack make it annoy the stuff in the cash shop be just crap also when your party be at a dungeon teleport summon there will cost real life money and then the market be already ruin due to a dupe bug which be in all previous version the economy ruin early access mean nothing in this case it be from 2012 if they do not fix the issue in the last 6 year they will not,neg
product receive for freeearly access reviewwhile it use to be a great game and the concept be cool recent update with new weapon and major change to mechanic have make the game almost completely unenjoyable and even downright agrevate with terrible tier system and no good way to get well part for people in low level,neg
early access reviewthis game be different this game be skillbase now its rng there be so much good about this game that be destroy single handedly by insanely incompetent developer the dev be act delusional not accept have make horrible decision every patch on the testing server that get massive criticism by the community get realease exactly the way it be anyways this ghosttown of a game be the result most thing that make this game special and different be go butcher by the dev patch after patch break and overpowered thing stay in the game for week without be patch and then instead of be adjust they simply get remove completely or replace by something else it just feel like some software programmer get together and make a game that just happen to be brilliant by accident but then they get over confident and think they be brilliant genius who do not have to listen to their community and can just test whatever they want its an alpha i get that but the community be break and so be the core gameplay this be what happen when dev think they be so much smart than everybody else maybe in a few month this game will be playable again but there will not be anyone leave to try it enjoy ur empty game,neg
when you have 2 1k hour nearly 1 000 usd spend on a game you would assume when an issue prevent you from log in the support team would handle it quickly its be 2 week since my support ticket have be open and its still not reslove trion be know for their poor support system now i know first hand,neg
this game claim to be free to play which it be pretty much a lie see as the only content you get be 1 map default equipment and only 2 huntable animal this game be not worth the wait for it to download even if you like hunt in real life,neg

  single handedly redefine a genre be an amazing feat especially as a f2p game i have play path of exile on and off since it first launch on steam i always could see it be greatness but there be thing put me off like the horrible netcode and desyncs after start again with patch 3 0 i could not resist recommend this game to make it brief it be epic imagine diablo 2 but amplify in every way with dozen of system and mechanic to keep you motivated while the combat feel as responsive and impactful as diablo 3 story path of exile take place in a very unique fantasy set you as the player get strand as an exile on the magical realm of wraeclast which be kinda the game world way of sentence you to death but you be no normal exile and soon discover that you be capable of great power by use mystical gemstone i do not want to go into too much detail but for an action rpg especially a f2p arpg the background be amazingly detailed the story telling be somewhat soul esque with npc item description and randomly spawn audiologs give information to the player which have to be puzzle together to get a comprehensive picture of the history of the world atmosphere set building on the mystical background story the developer have create a dark and grim world for the player to explore objectively there be a huge variation between zone and act while you start on the rough coast of wraeclast you soon move into muddy swamp through dark cavern fight through jungle discover old overrun city and fight in pompous palace the variety be excellent and some area which lead up to certain boss be very rich in atmosphere on the downside i feel that the variation which be definetely there feel not as distinctive as it could since almost all area be somewhat dark and gloomy i get that this be an artistic choice to reenact the style of world that diablo 2 be build but sometimes i catch myself be bore with the sorrounding although they be again objectively speak mastefully craft gameplay on the surface the gameplay of path of exile be cookie cutter arpg run through area click monster to death and get suck into the addiction of find well loot until you hit maximum level and grind the s it out of randomly generate endgame content below this surface there be an unprecedented level of complex system to keep you occupy for starter at the start of your journey you choose between 7 different class but despite genre convention your class choice do not really lock you into skill and playstyle since the active skill be not learnable on a skilltree like most other arpg do you could potentially use every skill the game have to offer with every class you choose at the start every active skill can be drop in the form of gem which then have to be sockete in your equipment to be use and also can be level to increase their power so no skill tree you ask oh boy there be one and when it come to skilltree it be the mother of all skilltree it be enormous complex and challenge the player in way that no other arpg have challenge you before mostly offer passive bonus and playstyle define key ability you have to carefully think about invest your skillpoint but there be always a way for you to switch passive if you feel like you have missplace some point which i feel be an excellent compromise between force the player to make smart choice but also give you the opportunity to correct mistake you may have make currency be also a biiiig part of the game and work different to almost any other arpg instead of gold you can sell item for different orb that you will need for craft and improve your equipment these orb be not only currency between you and the npc but can also be use to trade with other player player trading be vital and the community be very active so you can always spend your time trading with other to get the gear you desire what have to be say though be this path of exile be hard not only be it hard when it come to the challenge of beat it be content and believe me that in itself be a tremendous challenge but it also have a steep learning curve for new player the tutorial they implement work but they be in form of text and the player have to actively read all of the tutorial to understand the mechanic and system luckily the community be helpful and there be excellent video guide on youtube to get you start control the control feel tight responsive in most case which be elementary for arpg in the past i always have my problem with poe since i feel that the netcode be bad that the game have too many lag and desyncs to be thoroughly enjoy i be happy to report that thing have improve a lot most of the time the game feel as direct impactful and responsive as diablo 3 which be king in this regard sometimes there be lag but nothing to worry about in the long run presentation technically path of exile be good most texture be crisp detailed and the animation be fluid and well make some of the later area can even be breathtakingly beautiful but subjectively i personally do not like the artstyle of the game it feel to generic sometimes it even seem to clean while the envoirement be too static for my taste i be bore by the constant darkness and the dim lighting but all of this be subjective and i can not critize the game for my personal taste afaik most people really like the look of the game when it come to sound music i find path of exile to be surprisingly good most sound effect be distinct and impactful while the music play along nicely especially in the npc hub replayability content to sum it up the content be massive you have 7 character each can be level up to 100 which take week of time to reach you also can play every character several time with different build and those build will have unique playstyle there be ton and ton of loot skill gem material and other drop to look for the path of exile team be also very busy when it come to season every new season feature a new mechanic which get implement into the game most new mechanic that have be implement in a season stay in the game to expand the thing you encounter right now the game offer 10 story act split into two half while the second half revisit a lot of the old map while also change a lot and offer up new boss fight aside from the story you have a s itload of stuff you can do so do not worry about content when it come to the f2p part of this game do not worry it be fair you do not have to pay for anything you can play any part of the game for as much as you want for free the only thing you can pay for be cosmetic and some improvement to your stash make collect and sorting item easy for you while i find the price for the skin pet and stash improvement to be quite steep i applaud the developer for this system which be so fair that i spend money on their shop just to show gratitude tl dr prostight responsive control give a visceral and satisfying combat feelingmassive content with potentially hundred of hour of fun to be hadincredibly complexexcellent f2p systemconssubjectively dreary visual while technically soundsteep learning curve for new playershardcore can be frustrating since damage can spike out of nowhere and kill you in an instant recommendation if you like arpg and be willing to dive into a very complex game you will have hundred if not thousand of hour of fun with this one,pos
with over 125 hour in the pocket it be safe to say i know what i be talk about probably pro massive battle fun with your friend form a squad or platoon with your mate infinite replayability continent unlock again everything except cosmetic can be buy with ingame certscon friendly fire system lock your gun for 5 minute it be bind to happen sometimes when friendly just run into your explosive or infront of your vehicle can not make my character look cool without buy cosmetic with real cashit be a great game i recommend to my friend it be really fun when you play with your friend or join an outfit highly recommend,pos
early access reviewthis game be phemonal i love this game so much how can you compare it to smash bros this be too unique to ever be box down to smash this game deserve credit where credit be due 1 clean and well make 2 free 2 play that be not pay 2 win3 great gameplay4 addictive5 actually require skill and practice6 mostly great community7 not buggy8 great artstyle9 very uniqueif anything bad could be say about the game it be that it be not finish i want moar 9 10 espcially for a beta honestly why be not the developer charge 20 this be almost good enough to be a aaa game,pos

i will never recomend this game the matchmaking be super bad if you be a low rank like me the other player start bull you baceuse they be diamond god the system do not match you with player of your lever be do bad the player start say to report the person because be new o o my friend get report so many time because he do not select the god they want it and get suspend on smite las update suspention wave smite only answer to him in small word you get report we will suspend you without check if the report be truth or not,neg
early access reviewthe footstep in this game be complete garbage half the time when you move left or right you can hear that and when someone be run at you you can barley hear them but only can hear your self would not reconmend this game,neg
i have play on the launcher before so i have a lot of experience with the game pretty fun card game for newcomer to card game also enhance the fun even more for eld scroll fan i think es legends be a way well game than hearthstone since the game have a lot more go on in the board besides that there be way less rng decide game and depend more on strategy to win solo arena be also a pretty fun addition to es l compare to hearthstone pretty good game overall,pos
hear story of dungeon dragon seem epic and i love the concept i have never play the card game with anyone and when i stumble upon this game i be quiet amazed i have experience many mmo from wow to a million of other title but i have never really engage in them since all of them seem similar to wow all of them be reflection of what wow become and it seem pointless play other mmo this be a whole other story the character creation stage of the game do not amaze me although read backround story about each race be quite nice choose the back story of your now ready adventure be also unique allow you to rolepay and bond with your fighter as weird as that sound with these sort of game it be hard to see the thing that make you stay from the very beginning but the main reason behind all the hour that i put into the game be because of the combat system you do not have a million spell compress into hotkey that make you smash your keyboard at any important battle here you have a limited amount of tab of spell available at one time it be easy to handle and easy to get a hold of have such limited access to a wild root of spell prepare you to make serious choice but also allow you to develop your own way of battle with a few class which be quiet special and make the game more enjoyable you may have a friend that be a priest like you but he may be a engaging in battle priest obv not a tank whereas you may be a support priest heal him have a group of friend that be all of a different class be obviously the good resolution allow you to see how all the class engage in battle and how all the class can work together to reach the same goal the opportunity be endless and with no time limit on how long you have to spend play you can be decide your own way of fight technique in your own very way for some time that be the main reason i stay and i be not vouch for anybody else the game be more enjoyable not well by any mean when play with your friend dwell in deep dangerous dungeon with a group of close companion sound like a dream and if that be what you be look for in a game then neverwinter should be your choice there be a large number of dungeon from an early level with them get more advanced as you advance the monster get tough and more big with each new dungeon available each dungeon end with a final gigantic boss which you should find challenging they range from demented soul to dragon but yeah that be just a small ounce of the game if you be try to find out more about the game the good advice i can give be to actually play the game because stream and record video can not capture the full essence of the game by no mean be i an expert in this game but i hope that this help the newcomer that be try to get in the game,pos
terrible game and even more terrible optimalisation thank god for eso ff14 warframe rdr2 and other game acutaly any other game even rogue like like dead cell or something on mobile or play with your thumb,neg
early access reviewtl dr pros fun gameplay that be not too simple and not too complex incredibly generous f2p model con lengthy and lackluster tutorial campaign that you have to play through to get to other play mode interesting lore but it do not really come through from play the gamein depth review so i play hearthstone for about 2 year with the goal of spend no money on it after that time around journey to ungoro i feel like hearthstone be at the point where i could no longer build any deck that be fun to play without either invest both a ton of money and a ton of time i have be play eternal on and off since a little over halfway through the close beta but at that point i switch over to it as my dcg of choice i really like this game for 2 main reason 1 it be simple than mtg but more complex than hearthstone i really like mtg but i do not really like have to physically go to a place and interact with people in order to play it especially if they be non casual mtg player i do not much like the large amount of rng in hearthstone eternal be the perfect blend of be simple enough to be represent as a dcg but complex enough that it be as enjoyable as mtg it feel like it have enough rng to make thing varied but not so much that it start to make your decision feel less meaningful 2 i feel like i can build deck that be fun to play without have to spend any money i generally play this game for about 1hr a day on the train on the way to and from work so in reality my hour play be probably a decent amount high than steam report i feel like the deck i be able to make at low tier be still fun to play and after several month of focused playing i be able to make some of the budget upper tier deck at this point i can pretty easily get to the high rank each month and can make about half of the tier 1 deck i have spend no money to get card since i start play this game i have spend some money for cosmetic effect in game since i want to support the developer which be not something i feel inspire to do with hearthstone some thing i do not like about this game as many have probably say the tutorial campaign be sort of bore that alone would not be so bad but you have to play through it completely before you can do anything else i wish that you only have to play through a few tutorial game and then you gain access to the other mode of play as then you would be able to bounce back and forth between mode and it would greatly help avoid thing get bore i think there be some interesting lore to this game underneath the surface but you have to sort of dig for it it do not come across very strongly from just play the game i be not sure why it still early access on steam the game now have 3 full set and 2 expansion think hearthstone adventure and it be definitely not a game that would be consider in beta i can not really think of any additional feature or polish that this game would require in order that would warrant it be consider fully release,pos
i have play brawlhalla for several year the community be very competitive but they be nice than most gaming community the game be well make be update with new character and gamemode consistently,pos
i really like this game other than the ton of bug that it seem to have i have pvp turn off on my server but it do not really matter in the game because i be still able to hit my friend it also randomly turn off that setting but i be still able to hit my friend even when the setting be on from what i have see the party system do not even work i also have a few small issue that i wanna add i be able to call my friend pet when i use the bell i also have to spam click the stay key because it be not work for all of the pet the first time i have not find a page that will show you all the command you can do in game so if that be possible you should definitely consider put the command in the next to the option or something,pos
what amazing free to play game smite be moba but it feel more like 3d team base action game with many god to choose from and different map and game mode i absolutely recomend smite to anyone and evryone,pos
ever since i play the first neverwinter night i have always want to be a drow rogue shadowdancer with neverwinter night 2 this dream become true drow be add as a playable race and i be damn happy unfortunately the game play awfully and i could not get use to the control and then i have find this game and holy moly drow race checkrace specific quest check good story checkgood control checkgood graphic checkwhat more can i ask for it be fun check it out you can not be a shadowdancer though,pos
content make new character lot of build every expansion add to the game at first overwhelming with all the skill loot skilltree etc once you start dig into mechanic and playstile you start to enjoy its the arpg game out there constantly evolve start to play a long time ago but could not get into it at first take a good look at it 1 year ago again like what the game have become and really like where its go while free to play there be a hoarder in all of us so you probably will end up pay for a bit more stash not a big deal i think value for money yes after all i probably would spend more money on another game that would be uninteresting after 2 week,pos
early access revieweveryone who give this game a positive review be blind for starter i refund the game because it be not worth the 40 not even 30 the dev say the game will improve and will be optimize better but it be bad then the korean version be and let us be real it be a game that run on dx9 yes dx9 in 2018 it be impossible to optimize a game on dx9 for new pc i think it will be at the minimum dx10 but no it be still dx9 and even that be work like so you can not get stable fps even if you have the new ryzen oc at 4 4ghz and a 1080ti i still get 15 120fps and in city or crowded area be just plain unplayable the game be censor a lot of key element from the story be cut and make hole in the plot the combat be the only pozitiv thing about this game and that to be not the good or even that god the translation well it be impossible to understand it be so bad and there be a lot more but these be the key thing i be very disappointed so god luck for those who think this game will survive like this for starter if they want a smoth start why do not they make a beta test of 2 3days for those that buy the founder pack because they know the game be in a state that be unplayable after 7 8years of development and multiple fail and this be the reality of this game god luck for all who still play the game,neg
neverwinter online be a decent enough game but be not anything close to actual d d the game be more of a standard mmo with a d d stamp or veneer over it the quest be very repetitive and have little variation between them the foundry feature which allow player to create their own quest for the communitys use have some good quest but this tool have not live up to its potential nwo have an interesting skill system and the wide number of hireling and mount improve the game to some degree but overall the game be disappointing and lack long term play potential,neg

i have put a few lap down in this sim and through my experience i have see many thing improve with the addition of vr it have become my favorite racing simulator con no night or rain pricing model many people be turn away by individual pricing but car and track be always be add and with the purchase of the premium pack you can own all 70 very detailed and well make car and 42 track for 85 while iracing be 100 per year subscription pro amazing sound quality very few game come close to the crisp popping of the afterfire and dynamic of the engine in this sim excellent physics i find the physics to be very logical for the most part i love the way the brake work and weight transfer many sim seem to have the philosiphy of more unstable more realistic great force feedback i have read many review complain about the control and force feedback but use the logitech g29 this be one of the good force feedback engine i have ever use grant my setting be heavily tweak do not expect the control to be perfect without mapping or adjust the setting just like a race car need to be set up for a circuit your wheel need to be set up for specific task entire licensed motorsport series this sim containst all track and car for the official deutsch tourenwagen masters championship from 2013 2016 and even include classic dtm car from the early 90 r3e also include wtcc 2013 2017 adac gt masters gt3 and a dozen other motorsport series you will not find in most sim always improve since the game have launch r3e have go from a hotlapping sim to a full fledged multi series experience like no other car and track be always be improve regardless of age i be a bit surprised in some way to see mixed review but give the pricing model it be understandable but give comparison to iracing it be very affordable especially combine with the premium pack that unlock everything for less than what forza a couple dlc cost,pos
it be a waste of time i get fool by this game you start of with no money like any other game which be fine but they only allow you to hunt one kind of animal in one location each kill can give you up to 100 point if your lucky to unlock hunting right license the cheap one be 850 for only 24 hour whether or not you in the game to get one kill take about 2 hour if you know what your do cause walk and running be this game be pretty slow and you have no vehicle the game map be vary large weapon in this game be exstreamly over price 2 000 to 14 000 at least it be permanent you also need to buy ammo gear utility item some be reuseable some need to be refill very realistic great grafic ect but there be noticeable problem with the game that your just go to have to discover for yourself last thing control though few be very different from anyother game most people have ever play,neg
early access reviewthis be probably the most dissapointing game i have play the old game its so different it could easily be a different game have fun challenging gameplay but now they have scrap that idea and have make it the exact defenition of a pay to play this include overpower weapon that 1 shoot new player impossibly large sum of money require to get anything at all premium get twice as many item from crate as non premium play in a match with a premium do not give you additional money like it use to i could go on for hour the large problem i have encounter be player attach a really op weapon to their robot but nothing else and lower their cpu enough to get into new player match mean that they will always win and gain easy loot this mainly occur with the new aeroflak cannon which in early game destroy any ground target even though the weapon be design to be an anti aircraft gun secondly the insane cost of item so you play a match come first in the team and win gain a protonium crate and gain some stuff you do not want so you sell it and gain maybe 300 money now you want to buy something oh wait you can not because even the cheap gun cost 400 and sell item get you less than a tenth of what you can buy it for in some case so you play another match but there be someone with an aeroflak by the way do i mention that the aeroflak cost 75 000 to buy but that s not even the most expensive item there be the lock on rocket launcher another commonly use cheat weapon cost 125 000 to buy and i bet that leave you wonder but how do i get that well the sad answer be you do not or at least without spend more money anyway you obviously loose and get a rusty case and inside you find some more junk this have basically describe what the game feel like for non premium but wait what if you be a premium well other than cost a ton of money a single day cost a1 it be very good access to all the paint yes that s only for premium twice the item from crate custom profile pic ect all of this have lead this game to be very pay to play and it feel as if the developer just do not care enough anymore to change it they have get too greedy with money to think be this a good fun game 1 10 huge dissapointment,neg

early access reviewthis game although fun at time be frustrating and extremely grindy how many battle must i play before i can even rank up once it be so hit and miss soviets appear to be overpower and there be so much grenade spam this be because you get four grenade per life gunplay be interesting but it be so annoying that you have to sink multiple shot into somebody before they die this game have a lot of potential they could bring it out by make it easy to progress edit so i manage to reach rank 5 after around 25 hour of gameplay grinding on my german character i be greet with a panzer i ausf a not exactly great but i can not start with a tiger can i then i meet a m5a1 stuart this game be so absurdly unbalanced when you reach tier 2 it be unbelievable how poorly design it be one of the bad thing be that once one of your soldier get to tier 2 it automatically put all of your other soldier into tier 2 it mean that my rank 2 american infantry can enter game with sturmgewehr 44s and tiger iis destroy him which actually happen heres a gif that demonstrate it well to mention the awful balancing you can have a team full of panzer be and they will have m5a1 stuarts and more plus what be with this another thing since some random update the developer decide that they would increase the already monotonous grind by make item more expensive and up the rank require to play certain thing for example the tank crewman use to be unlock at rank 3 but when i start play it be change to rank 5 for what reason oh wait there be not a single reason except they want more money how surprising that be just one example it appear that there be many more i do not simply have the patience for this atrocity i would find great enjoyment in staple my testicle into the floor and stick scissor in my eye,neg
elsword be one of the first game i get on steam and i can tell you first hand its a great game but have some problem start off with the good the class be really cool and all be equally as awsome as the next each with a cute backstory i can not find anything wrong with them the story be good and the cut scene be piece of art they also come out with new character relitivly quickly for most mmo which mean there s always something new to try but even with all that say this be just another pay to win game if you want anything good that s perminant you have to pay for it out of your own wallet i be kind of get sick of these kind of thing all in all though if you do not mind not be the strong person out there then this game be for you pro great character amazing story fun easy to get startedcon pay to win gliche oh the gitche reset your attack loose armer lvs character disaere there be alot,pos

i play this game quite a bit back in 2017 on the phone i have enough hour for this game to properly review it duel link be meh if you be a fan of yugi oh i would give it shoot the card battle be short and the music voice acting be top notch my issue be that it be tedious require constant check up to gain exp and money to buy card by battle npc the double edged feature they include be an auto feature that play for you while a cool idea and allow you to quickly take out npc the game turn into an idle game another card game hearthstone make you fight npc and then throw you into the fray against enemy player to gain more exp the reason i be bring this up be because in hearthstone the fight be reward when you win against an enemy player i wish there be an option to fight hard npc from the get go as the ranked play in this game be full of salt most fight have revolve around have certain card with giant effect i remember one match where the dude already have three monster out on the second turn and one of them could negate set trap card and spell card i could not find the motivation to continue learn about all the card the game offer this game do have a few interesting mechanic when opening card you can go through an entire box and get all the card as long as you do not reset the box if you pay a fix price you can get all the card in the box or go at it one pack at a time and still gain the card i recommend not reset the box as it will mess up your chance you can also buy prebuilt deck to use the game also have a small pool of card take from each gen of yugioh no t like monster reborn or exodia so the developer do consider balance in some way there be multiple character with different ability to choose from which allow for a variety of benefit with your character and card my issue be that there be too many card as of writing there be more than ten box to go through and all of the card be usable in ranked play so you do not know what to expect when jump in a match i also have my account delete when i have this on my phone i have pegasus and quite a good amount of card to play with what i like voice act music and quick battle what i do not like auto feature energy system ton of card no lock meta,neg
you need to play it yourself to see what it be all about and when something be free give me one excuse why you should not at least give it a shot a great mmo and a great beat em up merge into one neat title which can be a little heavy on your wallet at time but be still an overall great experience at the time of writing i have put 100 hour into 3 character and it be mostly worth it a few frustration keep this from be a 10 10 game but it be certainly worthy of at least an 8 great combat mechanic fun combos good anime style visual passable story lot of variety and lot of fun and laugh highly recommend,pos

early access reviewedit 6 4 18 after perform all of the ini fixes i could find as well as the opengl fix on reddit the game have be run near flawlessly with 80ish fps in the field 120 in dungeon and a solid 55 60 fps in the main city if you be have trouble run the game i would recommend look into the opengl fix for sure someone else also find a way to actually disable the profanity filter and its be work for me now i can see people say heck again bless be in a weird spot right now and i will not judge anyone for want to wait a bit before decide to jump in i do not play on launch day so i can not speak on how that be however the game have run well enough for me and be very enjoyable so far combat feel great playing as a mage with the tab targerte i personally prefer it over action combat there be suppose to be action combat for all class but it be pull for all but the berserker prior to launch in order to be refine and eventually re add as for all the complaint about miss content in endgame they have already say it will be re add very soon approximately 2 week max until then there be still plenty to do you do not need to full speed rush to 45 there have be consistent hotfixe and patch over the last few day to fix and make up for the bug and balance issue currently happen and give a bit of time to smooth everything out the game will be even well than it already be the only complaint i can really consider as valid be about the translation it be absolutely horrid sometimes almost like it be throw into google translate luckily there be already 3rd party skill builder website that have proper translation so i can figure out what my spell even do quest translation have not be too bad however and i actually rather like alot of the voice act all in all i personally love the game so far and plan to keep play for a long while if it do not look good to you right now i would say just keep an eye on it or throw it on follow and wait until they sort thing out a bit more there be a balance patch plan to drop any day now which should alleviate alot of the issue people be have with low damage,pos
play for roughly 2 hour the good part of this game be the character creation screen though graphic wise it be pretty good look that be where it end for whatever reason optimization be horrible the game run best on max setting then it do on low setting class wise the way to level up skill and chain them be not really explain too well it be a learn as you go type thing mount have energy and if you run our you can not mount till it recover or you use an energy recovery potion side quest be not really explain what to do especially the gather one where it do not even tell you where to gather the item at i hit level 11 within those 2 hour and be on a main mission quest where you have to kill a level 1 elite ghoul it will 1 shot you deal 1400 damgae to you which be unavoidable if you be melee balance wise the game be a giant joke you can 1 shoot certain mob and in return get 1 shoot by mob you must kill to progress the story mission quest i also run into a bug where by die to that level 11 ghoul and select to spawn at the ghost instead of have to spend gem to respawn right where i be i would fall through the world over and over again unless i be able to time run the instant my character ghost touch the ground all in all it be a sorry excuse for a game i understand personally now why it have fail in every region it have ever come out in on my honest opinion as someone who be be play mmo since 2002 do not bother with this one let it die alone in a corner and go to something else it be not worth the time,neg

brilliant fun game to play very immersive the game be f2p but ofcourse with limitation you can get around not pay a penny so long as you do the mission but this method will be very time consume i be happy to support the dev on this game they have provide an enjoyable game and deserve to be pay it be a hard game and you can walk around without see a thing animal will scatter before you even get a glimps of them they smell you come from a mile away and track an animal for hour on end may sound tedious but it make for a very enjoyable experience it be not a game for everyone but i would say atleast give the game a try,pos
i know a lot of people do not like these type of game that show up because mobile game belong on mobile however i would like to try to convince you guy that this one be an exception i play several month of the mobile version of this game and hope to at least make those of you on the fence curious enough to give it a shot yu gi oh be a pretty reknown franchise that strike most of us as kid some young some old for me i be about 10 year old get ready for a cheerleading performance i do not miss be a cheerleader and i have enough time to watch the premiere episode of yu gi oh on tv i have enjoy the series and game ever since although some of the more complicated type of card disappoint me slightly coughpendelumscough yu gi oh duel link be effectively take the mobile game generation and bam and combine certain attribute to get a surprisingly entertaining hit from konami for the first time in a while outside of console game effectively cut the base yu gi oh game in half by limit the field of 5 monster and spell trap zone to 3 deck size from 40 60 to 20 30 and everyone start with 1 less card save that you start second as per the new ruling beyond that and a limitation of certain card that make the original game a fix meta and you have a surprising hit with some special cameo from well know character that play out as the original would otherwise play as your favorite character as you want i be sell by my ability to play as and start as seto kaiba himself some may prefer yami yugi or mako or mai or joey or hell even friggen bandit keith in america and with the recent release of the ever so popular yu gi oh gx series character card and map you have more option to play and for the most part next to no limitation in which card you want to use for which character now to the imporant question like what about ban list yes konami be in the process of add a ban list for certain card now that there be a large pool for player to work with however it be literally patch in a few week ago and may take time for them to adjust to the current meta what about insert archtype they get add in usually when a character know to use say archtype appear in the game most recently they have jesse anderson run around with obtainable crystal beast card your favorite archtype be likely already there if not on the way be there a strong deck type right now yep the common one i see a lot be blue eye white dragon deck use seto kaiba warrior deck use joey wheeler fire king use by whoever you think would utilize them the most i personally have be use chazz prinston ojama deck recently with fly success follow by use yugi moto for geminis be there any major problem with the game that exist before the port sadly yes thankfully it be the only know problem to mention and you guess it spam bot in the chat konami recently update their tos that make me think that they may be consider a strong action against these illegal spam bot promoter but i have yet to see any action yet however remove bot from a game or any other platform can be an uphill battle especially if they have be there for a while be there any issue with the steam version of this game no bug that i know of konami seem to be frequently keep an eye on the game status and bug and be active to update and fix them i personally wish they would allow for me to fix the screen resolution i be currently use a 1366x768 resolution but the game screen be slighly large then that with no option to resize or anything i be play on the mobile version prior as well but i do not wan to start a new game can i sync my datum yep just click data transfer on the start screen and make sure you have a konami account from the website that the game redirect you to i have already sync mine and it work really well be it pay to win depend on how you see it the game use a premium currency of gem as a means to buy card however say gem can be earn pretty reliably by just play the game pay for thing like duel orb be not even necessary in my opinion or extra deck slot the card package that can be buy for real money however be up for debate because while they offer the same card you would get for play the game normally they can be obtain faster by buy them and there be certain package deal that reward you gem and sometimes an sr card certainty for buy them i personally do not think it be pay to win because you can earn all the same card that everyone else can some effort and time require for event only card not everyone feel the way i do though and it be understandable if you guy have any other question and concern regard the game feel free to ask and please be sure to give this game a fair shot it be worth the time promise 3,pos

it make me sad to see people say this be pay to win there be nothing in this game that you have to buy there be convenience item and nothing actually give you an advantage over other player i have be play this game since back when there be only 4 class and it have evolve and play beautifully the item that you can buy on the shop be cosmetic and quality of life to put it simply there be costume which grant be expensive but you do not need them at all they give very minor stat to your character and some of the late game armor that you can easily obtain look well anyway there be also pet and mount which be just quality of life item that give you an easy and lazy pve experience the only thing that i can say be a usual must pay be the second b slot which should not be a pay thing but if you be go to enjoy and play the game a lot then what be 8 other than that you do not have to buy anything i have never expand my inventory or bank space and i get by just fine and happy now to the gameplay it be an extremely unique mmorpg that combine 2d side scroll with 3d element it have a unique combo system between it be attack button and skill and each character feel unique and able to customize to your play style each character currently in the game have 3 job to choose from each of which greatly alter your character play style all and all the game pve be superb and i would recommend this game to anyone who be look for a unique and well put together mmo now for the pvp it be a very fun experience whether you be casual or hardcore go into it it be very skill base and require you to have a deep understanding of your character and the character your go against it come in the form of 1v1 2v2 3v3 and a base race game mode where it fall short sometimes be it be balance play some character against other can be overwhelming for one side and frustrating at time but it be nothing that practice and effort can not solve the big issue that i have have with this game be latency there will be random moment in pve where i will be attack a monster and it will not register any damage for several second and this same deal can happen in pvp along with an enemy lag teleport around but it all usually sort itself out overall i believe that this be a great mmo that have grow beautifully and have the potential to stay amazing for year to come and i would reccomend it to anyone look for something new,pos
early access reviewfracture space be a great game not really innovative but good it be a refresher from the constant first person style shooter and the crappy yearly release i love it and would reccommend it to anyone,pos
  enjoyable in short burst for a long time i stop play nw because it be an unoptimized piece of grabo and cryptic be not all that interested in fix it i have return after more than six month to nw and i get to say its a pretty fun f2p mmo take in small dose the combat be fast paced and satisfying plus after a longtime the game be finally optimize and you can properly enjoy it it should run at 50 60fps on most pc even in more crowded area although its base on the forget realm d d set this game be nothing like its tabletop counterpart or neverwinter night for that matter nw be an action mmo through and through your character have no alignment to speak of so you can choose whatever class you fancy without a worry in the world except for the fact that some race work better for some class the voice acting be decent the music be pretty good graphic be acceptable well than most f2p mmo on the market just do not go into this game expect the next big thing if you be not willing to spend any money on this game then i would suggest you stay away from pvp as a non pay player you will not be on equal footing with those that decide to pay for some cash shop item that make your life much easy or those who have play aton as a side note you be able to convert astral diamond a currency you get from different in game activity into zen the premium currency that can also be buy with your hard earn to buy stuff from the cash shop but the rate be not all that great another problem for free player be that we be limit to 2 character slot per account which be kinda and the only way to get more be with zen on the other hand you can make and use as many free account as you like what s more 3 race be lock behind game pack that go for 49 99 for the moon elf 69 99 for the dragonborn and 189 99 for the menzoberranzan renegade the pack also include some mount a char slot each and some otherthat not all that useful as for pve its pretty entertaining albeit repetitive once you hit max lvl your main goal be to obtain some artifact and do the campaign which mostly consist of do daily quest get some resource which you will use to research some passive skill for your character the quest you do be not all that memorable but at least they be not very long so you will not have to spend too much time with em recently they have also introduce a system that make the campaign faster for an alt but i have not spend much time with it so i can not say how much faster they really be all in all if you can look past its flaw which be quite a few nw be a pleasant way to spend your spare time mindlessly kill monster and grind some gear,pos
i would not recomend this game for anyone with a low income source this game may be free to play but it be for sure pay to win and it take forever to level up in this game the company that back this game up be just horrible they do not care for the player want they do what they think will benefit the game as a source of major income the character be extremely unbalanced if you like pvp it have decent pvp i be not go to lie about that but you will need to max your character and get the good equipment to have any chance of survive in the arena if you want a game that be good this be definatly not the game you would want to pick,neg

great game to play with friend but i would be very glad if dev would add some cool feature create own map more map state etc character customisation maybe some minigame different style of table background and more it would be also great it there be a big map or something close to a monopoly hope it will improve,pos
early access reviewso far it seem like a fun game although i have only complete the tutorial since i be unable to join any game at the moment the graphic could use a touch up and the game would benefit from some true anti aliasing option but what be present now be a step in the right direction the gameplay be fun so far some good voice act from the ai and the sound design be pretty spot on thus far appreciate that they have make the game free as well and do not really mind the microtransaction because of this this be one of the only game in alpha that i believe will actually leave it,pos
review update first impression kinda mixed about this one while it be definitely well than hearthstone aka rnjesus stone it be kinda bad than magic the gathering so i will rate this as neither a great nor a bad game to get second thought edit thought behind the rating below final rating this game look promising to begin with first impression be mix with a rating of 4 75 10 although it have some positive element the reviewer can not really state that he be impressed by the game and its core element the collection be ok but nothing be impressive to any degree this feel like another game to be forget within the next couple of month the only positive element be the graphic which prevent the inevitable 0 0 10 rating this time i rate this game as 3 5 10 which mean that i strongly advice people not to play this game even though it be free to play it be simply not worth it there be well alternative 1 gameplay 1 0 3 5the two lane system be by no mean unique mmdoc have a three lane system and it still fail in the long run due to yolo expansion come out es l have some balance yet the card pool be very limited at the moment 0 5 and the majority of the effect be hijack from other ccgs it be inevitable but still a point to consider while create a game 1 5 as i have collect 70 of the baseset it become increasingly depressing to watch so 0 5 this start to look very much like hearthstone unfortunately but it be nevertheless true 2 graphic aesthetic 2 5 3 0the graphic of es l be very well craft although i have only play this game for a very limited period of time the voice over be adequate but a bit tiresome in the long run so 1 0 for that one at least the animation be much well than hearthstone an extra 0 5 from that aspect 3 uniqueness 0 0 1 5my apology to all es player but this game be by no means a unique game in the ccg genre and no those prophecy just simply do not make the cut my friend nothing else to say compare to magic the gathering you all know it be come anyway so i will leave it there 4 replayability 0 00 2 0as with all game replayability be important if you want to keep the playerbase at a decent size i fear that this game do not have that much to offer atm if you want a casual ccg with rng as a major factor then you should turn to hearthstone while the grand old ccg magic the gathering have everything that suit a grand strategist need so 1 5 from these consideration but i still have some faith in the future development of this game so if the developer be aware of the competitive ccgs out there they may increase the replayability value for es l through several tweak this thought give a slight bonus as i be currently in a good mood 0 25 update nope the start hand size be a joke and game decide as the ring so unfortunately i have to give 0 75 for this,neg
i like this game and play it a lot on google chrome i recently get it on steam and have have a huge reminder of how hard it be to really have fun without make micro transaction lot of grinding be need to advance further in the game but the multiplayer be fun its free to play so do not expect anything amazing unless you be willing to pay perfect to pass time 7 5 10,pos

early access reviewgame feel like a major cash grab be really hope for an mmo and it certainly be an mmo it look fairly decent but run awfully while do so on a 5820k 4 7 and 1080 i be get 100 fps farming with no one around me after ini fix pvpe against 10 people dip me down to 30 constantly with stutter occur far too often the main reason i buy this game be pvp at it be current state there be no arena rank honor point system work it be bug currently among glaring balance problem while i can not speak for 100v100 i can safely assume it be nearly unplayable leveling be fine around 30 it start slow quite a bit and force me to take quite a bit of side quest i hope for nothing more than this game success in it be current state though i can not recommend anyone spend it be current pricetag the dev have not make this game a labor of love which be what i be hope for the glaring problem from previous version be still glare problem now after year of development and in production i be really hope for a new renovation of the game i really do not get anything i be hope for i highly suggest you look at something like gw2 that be free to play and essentially do what this game do but well tactic be essentially weaponset in gw2 and each have utility skill you can manipulate skill also combo in gw2 linearly instead of separate chain regardless of this i feel the system be much more polished and playable,neg
definitely worth try i use to play hearthstone and few other card game and this one be really decent but sadly not perfect it have very enjoyable campaign with card upgrade system i really enjoy it a lot of interesting interaction between card with clear description basically you do not have to alt tab and google what specific passive on the card do its all in the game display nearby card in separate window it be a lot easy to get good deck in tes legend compare to hearthstone and ofc f2p the only bad thing be the same unbalanced and stupid rng system that most card game use basically all your card come in random order which itself can ruin your game even in first turn this be really boring and i be surprise they do not do any improvement to reduce amount of rng related to get card for example they could at least let player choose 2 card which they will always start with and 2 random the next logical step should be give us option to pick half card by yourself and half random instead of throw random only except situation where you use special action to choose 1 card and throw 2 other away really just too much rng be the only problem with these kind of game,pos

back in the 1990 and early 2000 you would call this thing a free demo the amount of dlc be laughable and they have naturally make sure that any car or track you would reasonably recognise be dlc so assume this game be price at 51 99 for the full package it be absolutely not worth it the car be not enjoyable to drive the physics be not particularly accurate the ui for controller be abysmal and the graphic while good in some place be overall pretty poor at this price go and buy assetto corsa you will get well value for money,neg

overall a pretty polished game the background be detailed enough to look nice without give off massive lag the character animation look natural and most of the dragon look great like all free to play game there be many part of the game that be block off until you purchase them unlike many other game of its kind you can get access to most of the content without pay a dime there be many load screen but you be go to come across those with any unity game or even 3d game for that matter again for a free game you get a lot more than you pay for,pos
while the prospect of get more elder scroll lore while wait on the next mainline game to come out may seem attractive legend be not worth the hassle it be a hearthstone clone more or less pleagued by the same rng and money grab issue thatp lague all ccgs every element of the game be rig to extort money from you if you want a remotely competitive deck as with all ccgs be prepare to blow 100 on card pack so you can rng the card you need or get the dust you need to craft them the non pay content will last you a few hour at most and then the game will begin demand money for a few more hour which will be deplete after you chew through it because they only have a few content pack out now all of which be hideously overpriced because the people who do spend money on ccgs buy the pack 40 at a time because as psychological research have show us ccgs and other microtransaction scheme be tailor to prey on whale people with compulsive personality disorder or poor impulse control who can not resist the urge to see what come out of that next pack or what card come off the top of their deck next they be biologically predispose to take risk minimize loss overstate their gain and keep pull any lever or push any button that make pleasant noise or flash pretty light at them game dev know this so they make their game to milk these whale for their money legend be no different beyond the hideously exploitative pricing model the game itself be the usual rng garbage that all ccgs be you can be mop the floor with someone and be up 20hp one turn then the next they luck into a card combo that win them the game likewise you can be struggle all game against someone and then rng hand you the perfect card to turn the game around while stiffe your opponent there be very little personal skill or tactical thinking involve the personal skill element boil down to make a balanced deck and make wise trade in the game that be maybe 30 of what determine who win and who lose another 10 be probably the rock paper scissor game design philosophy that play out like deck that spawn lot of small enemy lose to deck that spawn big enemy lose to deck with a lot removal lethality lose to deck with lot of small enemy the other 60 be all luck plain boring dumb luck i can not recommend this or any other ccg ever if you love these game seek help instead there be treatment for gambling addiction,neg

update 6 1 14updated again 5 4 18war thunder sound great on paper but the gameplay in this game be total garbage the combat be awful since 95 of player will likely just play in arcade mode if you get someone tail you you be do i have try every move in the air combat book and nothing work this make this the most infuriating game to play because you can not escape a plane behind you you literally need someone else to shoot them and good luck get help from random player the control be also terrible i do not know what sick joke people play by tell people mouse mode be good but it be awful you do not have a direct feel for how much you be bank at any give moment and it be very difficult to get the reticle to line up for a lead shoot most game you will just spend your time circle an enemy or if you try for a head on engagement you will likely be ram as death by plane collision be extremely common and some try to do it on purpose take out a bomber which be hard to shoot down by ram it the playerbase be not very helpful and no one really help out you be most likely to be greet with lol l2plane verbatim if you ask question the realistic and simulator mode resolve some of these issue but the game control still feel bad in mouse mode my joystick have not arrive yet but base on comment from many in the community mouse mode be easy than joystick mode so i doubt honestly it will get much well with a joystick there be far less player in the realistic and simulator mode as well balancing be also an issue there be some entire nation which perform far below other most player would say to play russian and british plane and avoid axis plane because they be not too good at the starter tier the chaika a soviet plane be the most decry overpowered plane in the game a high turn rate biplane which fire 4 deadly cannon at a very rapid rate which can quickly take out the other plane at the tier and even many that be high than it matchmaking will suddenly ramp the difficulty up for you significantly and start introduce you to many bomber and fighter as well as many strong ground target which need large bomb to take out at this point you have nothing but light gun to shoot at ground target and light bomb this mean you will be force to slug it out with the strong plane which you will likely lose to since they have superior gun the overall process of get to your next plane be very painful and do not feel well implement there be many thing you can research but the game present them in a haphazard way that do not make much sense some tier 1 plane can not be research but then other can and after a random other plane be research then a new one can be research that be in no way relate the game research tree be confusing as much of the rest of the game be even to someone who know what to look for i spend a fair amount of time try to give this game a chance and it be just the most frustrating game experience i have have would not recommend at all if you be look at this compare to wargaming game this be way more pay to win model as you do not get any free xp rp in this game and with the premium currency you could easily skip up to a high tier plane i have play maybe 50 75 match and i have 50k free rp that if i spend premium currency on i could unlock probably a tier 3 plane the game have 5 tier with multiple plane within the same tier this game strongly reward those who spend money far more than a wargaming game and it will likely prove frustrating for a player that be not hardcore into air combat and be honestly not that satisfy for someone who be interested in air combat give realistic and simulator mode be the mode you would want to always choose a sidenote about those mode too the match be very long the timer for realistic match more realistic than arcade but not as hardcore as simulator be 60 minute to the generally 15 25 minute timer for arcade match the arcade mode to me just feel very off and the difficulty curve into the realistic mode be much high which make it more difficult to grind for your next plane updateso i have hear about the ground combat i decide to try it out and see if that be any well of course world of tank be the first thing to compare it to you start out in a lowly tank with a weak gun but you face similar tank and all be fairly fun arcade mode numb down the difficulty a bit too much since you can immediately see where the enemy tank be even if they be in heavy cover realistic mode be a bit too punishing though unfortunately if you be moderately decent at all you get up tiered because of your skill level very quickly and then you will be face off against tank you can not hurt so you will find yourself cornered on map with no teammate team work in this game be somehow even more non existant than world of tank likely due to the large map and spread out goal often time flank the enemy tank and shoot the rear do not even work after a dozen match of lose and be wipe out with minimal xp gain i just give up again you also get to worry about plane bomb you at any moment as if the overpowered tank you can not hurt be not enough gaijin be never go to improve this game clearly they have decide they want their game to be this realistic game that they will not back down from once again realistic mode be far more sparsely populated than arcade though and i think this be a huge mistake arcade mode be basically what world of tank be though it have more enjoyable gameplay war thunder grind combat be sloppy and feel like a mess this game be a pretty big download and an even big disappointment for all the hype it receive if you want ground combat stick to world of tank though i can not honestly recommend that anymore teamplay be so awful there that match be rarely fun anymore we be sorely lack a good game in this space now but the choice be to make do with gaijin and wargaming very mediocre game or do without frankly i would rather do without these be just exercise in frustration and time waste 5 4 18 update so the plane combat be still awful tank combat feel a little well than before but the entire way this game play be awful i stop play world of tank a few year ago due to decline in its quality but look like war thunder be die off and be do much bad do not waste your time on this game there be just nothing of value gain from it i feel rip off of the time i waste on this even for free,neg

early access reviewthis game can not possibly be in early access this be because i be one of the early tester in 2013 when it be not on steam this game have be out for 3 year it start off the most fun game i ever play and it get well and better then it go towhen they start make thing harder to get and remove good feature of the game it quickly go to the dev do not listen to the community at all they just update the game put more gun block etc but they remove mega and all the time you spend make that mega be destroy because you do not have enough cpu anymore to summerise this the game be great it quickly go tobr they remove great feature ignore their player and then procide to ruin the game for people,neg

note this be an update review i have take down my previous not recommend one a while back i have such a severe love hate relationship with this game but this one will remain i have be with this franchise since 1999 hour play on here be so far off due to play for so many year off of steam with my love of the franchise you will not get a biased review here in fact i do not even always know why i recommend this game and yes i know how commentor work if i have this many hour in a game how can it not be recommend quite frankly because this be not the same game i use to play all those hour this be an mmo and mmos change but i recommend this game to an extent the beginning and first few expansion be great but then i think there be only 1 word to describe how the game become bloated they seem to add more feature for advancement than actual content sometimes it feel as if they be try to give the illusion that there be more content than their really be kunark ascend try do that with the epic 2 0 weapon you will be do more in old content than current content to gain that weapon and i be talk content that be much low than you i do not mind work for a weapon that be the good in slot for 2 ish year but their be not much in the way of new content to do i know i do not speak for everyone but i feel this be a game that only get bad if you rush it there be over 8 000 quest in this game but expansion only add in the double digit these day if you be a quester if you want to adventure i can only recommend this game if you do not rush because once you get to the end game you will see many illusion of content so why recommend this game the content that be there be fairly good it suck that it end so quickly at end game but the grind will at least be real if you want that but i mainly recommend the start and the first few expansion after that it just get bloated but some people do enjoy that this be just my 2 cent i do not expect everyone to agree with me but you can get hundred if not thousand of hour out of this game on 1 character and not be able to do everything unless you rush and only focus on the last couple expansion but grinder can get those hour i be just speak of unique content not repeat,pos

woo boy this be go to be a fun review tldr at the end this be a good game it really be there be so much i want to say about it so i will get start graphically this game be amazing not because it be hyper realistic but because the art style be unique to a point where it be almost impossible for it to look aged this game be ten year old and still look great gameplay wise it be fun you run around you shoot people on the opposite team it be not always shoot bullet though there be 9 class each with their own unique weapon there be rocket launcher grenade launcher and flamethrower there be a variety of unique secondary weapon to be have as well even the class that use gun have unique gun to use the different class be play in a variety of different way so there be probably a favorite class for everyone and then there be character design i could probably gush about this for hour but i will not each character be recognizable simply by their silhouette they be all very unique to the point that each character model have its own unique tooth and ear then each character have their own unique set of weapon that usually follow a theme the scout main weapon be all scattergun the heavys main weapon be all minigun etc these character not only have unique design but unique personality and unique background too just listen to the voice line they say as you play the game will give you an idea of their personality it be so cool to see a game like this give its character so much personality and the character be even expand on in comic_strip that you can view online for free the character could probably be describe as extreme and even ridiculous but this somehow make them feel more real and more enjoyable there be probably something to be say about diversity here especially because of its competitor overwatch there be no dancing around it this game be simply not as diverse in character gender and ethnicity as overwatch be however the character present in this game have far more personality than the character present in overwatch i have play overwatch before and unlike this game be not enthral by the character with this game i be almost immediately draw in because of the character themselves not just the gameplay sadly however woman design be once upon a time make for this game but for whatever reason be scrap they be very unique design too and if the team actually have follow through on make them and have apply the same effort they do for their male character they would have make some of the good dang female character in game i be go to apologize about the overwatch comparison but i be still salty about blizzard make half bake female character and then be tout as progressive when they be really just play the middle to attract the most player the tf2 character designer could make woman character that would crush overwatch in every way if they ever decide to do that there be also something to be say about the community it suck big time if you be a woman or have a high pitched voice you be probably well off not use the voice chat at least in casual mode if you do you will probably get sexist comment hurl at you or if they just think you have get a high pitched voice call a squeaker and may even get kick a lot of people in casual mode also type a bunch of racist sexist homophobic and every ist and phobic thing in the book into the chat it be painful to read but hey it sure be fun get domination on homophobe and then taunt after kill them so that be something you can do of course it be not all bad and most game of this nature end up with a community like that anyway so it be no surprise really there be a bunch of good folk out there too i have meet some good folk through this game and if you play it for long enough you will too just do not be surprised about the bad folk plus there be a bunch of different sub community that be usually full of nice people tldr it be a good game and it be free to pick up and play so you have get nothing to lose but your time it be fun have a bad overall community but nice little sub community unique and fun character and a lot of cool map play it and have fun,pos
early access reviewgreat gameplay and teamwork the different type of ship you can earn make it dynamic right now the only multiplayer mode be 5x5 and the game take about 15 25 minute it will be interesting to see different arena and map type later on note to player you can not be a hero in this game you need to pay attention to what your team be do and figure out your place be a support ship and either heal a large attack or defense ship or sacrifice yourself to steal an enemys ground can make all the difference so do not knock what seem like a less role off the table without give it a try sometimes glory be achieve in unexpected way during this game which give it great potential i pay the 20 for the vanguard founder pack because i enjoy the game and want the dev to earn what they deserve let us hope they continue to do the job right,pos

the crusaders of the lost idol be probably one of the good idle game out there with well think mechanic crafting talent and quest add enough to the game to make it more interesting than other similar idle game however it will also suffer the same flaw past a certain point it become extremely repetitive and at most you will probably only 5 minute at a time to upgrade your game and let it back to its idle state pro easy gameplay funny graphic quest talent craftscon rapidly repetitive,pos
early access reviewa nice attempt to create a proper tcg yet fail with bad design choice that enforce rng even more than need mechanic wise i prefer the game over it be competitor like hearth stone but a major issue that i have with this game be the way they design the resource system why in the world would you want to have your resource in form of card in your actual deck that poorly craft design increase the rng that tcgs have to deal with even more than require cause not only do you have to make sure to draw the right card you also have to make sure now to not draw resource if not need and vice versa could be an amazing tcg but fail due to a very stupidly design fundamental mechanic,neg

i be go to preface this by say i have only play 3 mmos include this one and none for more than 6 hour i really want to like this as a huge forget realm d d fan but the combat be truly dreadful and there be not enough detail from the onset to make me want to go further from a more technical aspect the graphic be mediocre but then they be obviosly set up to accomodate low end machine the audio be below par and the control though not terrible couldbe mich better especially where the camera come in to play,neg

a big fan of wolf of tank but lose interested after i realise the matchmaking be horrible lose money after each round have to buy gold and bundle in order to have a chance in the game i would recommend it to people who be look for a small 6v6 match but it really should be 12v12 make it more fun my first review as well but i do not recommend it to people who be look for a game with good matchmaking and not pay 2 win for that i recommend warthunder tick off everyone you want nearly fun game but lose my interest,neg
early access reviewit use to be good a year or so ago but the dev have since make some pretty poor design and balance addition this game be worth pick up for an hour or so but then you realize how terrible of an item system that they have design be do not waste your time if you want to play it you should have pick it up a year ago those be the good day,neg

bar the ai this be a brilliant flight sim i see in all the negative review complaint about complex control this be not arma where plane and helicopter model less than a quarter of the system they have this be a realistic combat flight sim if you do not have a joystick you be not go to enjoy this sim note that even game mode be more realistic than arma to those who think this be just another free to play money grab each module have about the same amount of time put into them as each complete battlefield game maybe not combine arm pro extremely detailed system modelling for the a 10c p51 and ka 50 although control can be frustrating without a trackir very high detail graphic wise free update add to the sim as well as fix thing the engine be also update sometimes for more functionality very large range of vehicle and aircraft to fight againstcon poor ai without extensive scripting in the editor they overuse afterburner and run out of fuel when they reach their target mig 31 enter dogfight rather than outrun their enemy ground unit can see through forest and building helicopter gunship fly high when attack and almost never hover etc some aircraft have low resolution texture that look ugly virtually unplayable without a joystick but that be once again expect,pos
quite fun may be a pain that you can not unlock everything in the game without pay real money but there be still many gun you can have fun with disassemble also it be quite nice that there be only so few who actually play this game so it be easy to get daily record especially if you be disassemble an unpopullar gun d,pos

early access reviewvery fun twist on smash bros i have play it every way possible on a gamepad with my little brother 4 player custom online match with friend 1v1 competetive and 4 player online what make brawlhalla awesome be that no matter how i have play it its always be a total blast i have have people tell me that it look too floaty or that there be not enough item i think this stem from the flawed idea that every game should be smash bros while brawlhalla do mimic it in many way i think that a lot of the difference be what give brawlhalla a little kick half the fun of this game be aerial battle and throw bomb at your friend which the mechanic allow a lot of,pos
this be my first review and i can easly say that i do recommend this game for everyone before anything it be an eld scroll game and this be already a reason to try it even if you do not like card game you should give this one a chance the art work on this game be perfect absolutely amazing the way the game mechanic work make him a very fun and very different on this gender you can build a deck play story mode relate to the elder scroll lore fight against other player duel in the arena compete in tournament fight with friend and lot of other feature it totally worth play it,pos
after spend the majority of my afternoon play this game i can say it be really good if you enjoy the elder scroll series and be find of and tcg like harthstone magic the gathering or even the warcraft one this be for you it nail how a online trading card game should be the mechanic be balanced and fair plus this game be far more skill base over the dumb luck approach that some tcgs take cough cough hearthstone cough cough the card be easy to get through leveling and i quickly find my self with a surplus of option the game even give you some tough chocie early on the race you pick at the start even influence what card you will be get more of at the start the story be decent to nothing extreme but i find my self chuckle at a couple line and even care about one of the character that show up there be also checky nod and reffrence to the es series not go to spoil them though because some them be worth the reaction over all i think this be a very good and well make game and i look forward to play it more,pos
the beginning be insanely frustrating there be a tutorial but it just cover the basic i think 3 tower and 4 bloon so you got to figure out th rest by yourself you can look up what the upgrade do and figure out what the tower itself do from there no idea where to look up what bloon do while play you be slowly get there but it be nothing for people with low patience as myself i guess you get throw into multiplayer with people who seem to know much more than you do and thus they win while you do not know what their tower be do or how to counter it i think you have to lose some match before you be able to win or jsut be extremely lucky if you like you can buy strong tower right away via microtransaction maybe you have well chance of win then the ui be a bit confusinng but i guess that be because it be for moblie i be slowly get the hang of it overall i can not say i enjoy the game but since it be so well receive i want to try and play some more currently i just can not recommend it since this have enough positive rating i do not feel bad about give it a negative now but i may change this later if i come to enjoy this,neg

early access reviewgreeting good enough game unfortunately lead by a company that seem to push a political correctness agenda this be very subjective but i can not support a company that go out of there way to ban me for the name beaverjuggler which be at good a mildly suggestive sexual innuendo that only adult will get to begin with even if that be not even my intention but be purely a result of direwolf staff project their own thought and delusion on other people i pay for this game i play it a lot but i do not support this kind of ridiculous free speech restriction doe i do understand that a private company that make their own rule be very welcome to enforce them i choose not to support such a company plain ridiculous lashing out cause of hurt feeling and projection,neg
very realistic simulation and a lot of fun once you get the hang of it expect to spend atleast 40 50 hour on just learn the basic though even more if you be not use to combat sim,pos

early access reviewthis game be amazing it be totally awesome the gameplay be sensational i really enjoy it the ui be a little clunky but okay i could deal with it it be a fantastic game however the in game currency system be a sham you have to pay for everything every single little thing you want to change about your character or even keep play you have to pay it be such a shameless method of the developer force you to keep play the game more what be bad if you choose a new career path after spend age get to rank 5 you have to pay to change this limit all your character option back to lv 1 again so you start from scratch again you also can not use certain weapon so what if you wanna swap back to the career you have already unlock you have to pay again i have waste 100 000 finding that out you only get about 7 000 per game i be constantly tax on every piece of this game i olve play it but this be well enough to force me to stop let us play the f ing game i do not mind pay for thing but it be far too expensive and they should stay unlocked unbelivable ruin a great game,neg
so i start this ride off think okay it be get graphic that would make window 98 chuckle 8 bit audio and the main ghost be adorable as atmatmatmatm a few door in bam adorable cardboard cutout of a spooky skeleton make me jump a little but it be all fun and game until room 60 or so untilatmatmatmatmatmatmgot real i rarely get spook by game i rarely feel that fight or flight adrenaline rush congrats spooky you do what big triple a horror title fail miserably to do now if you will excuse me i need to change my pant before finish this game,pos

i believe so far that be a noob in this game be quite cool all the geari have pick up actually work also when people be fight dungeon they do not descriminate by not help you the high level player do not look down on you but they do not pay attention to you eithier lol you can pretty much solo until the story take you to a dungeon of group boss fight then you have to wait for someone to show up and hope they be not low level as well lolso in this game i wuold say if you solo it be prepared to wait if you have get friend who play then you be golden,pos
early access reviewwell i be sorry to say that the developer have manage to wreck what be one of my favorite game 1 the new battle mode be lame i be not interested in blast cube off of tower i want to engage enemy bot yes i know that be still part of the game but be should be the only part i think it would work much well to simply have zone control base on sole occupation of area similar to world of tank also have too many mode have cause crazy long que times what use to take 5 20 second to join a match now can take 15 minute 2 the developer have decide that component that be high tier should not be place on low tier bot this have essentially ruin all my bot design and make the game bot design and game play very cookie cutter it do not balance game play as much as it create identical build due to few option i will not be back to robocraft way to turn victory into fail,neg
as many have say before me and it be necessary to repeat you really end up put money out to do much of anything once you add all of that money up it be beyond what you would pay for a retail release of a game that should be of high quality than this,neg
so i see it be not enough for a review to say the game be good when it clearly be but i will ellaborate my thought so this game be my day to day grind simulator for when i just wanna chill and listen to some sweet music since i be not a big fan of diablo 3 and diablo have kinda outlive it be era and pass on to the forgotten but not forgotens hall of fame i be not compare this game to diablo in anyway and that s why i think it be good it be another game it have a lot of interesting very well make lore ton of spell attack and different way to defend yourself use all kind of gem that can freely be socket in and out of it be colour match socket in your armor or weapon the game have a certain difficulty it be not a beginner frendly game in itself it have a good introduction to wreaclast but it be the community that make that part great there s ton of guide and video on how to play the game i myself have watch the streamer and youtuber ziggyd to get a feeling for patch and new item the above have be almost only positive but path of exile have some downside and not just two but a bunch a few big to mention be the constant unsteadyness in the server you will never know when the server suddenly decide to spike out and there have be period where the lag have be almost character destroy but it seem to have get alot well it be repetetive like there be 4 act with different area and a ton of different map but it all boil down to run from one end to another killing all in your way with a little sidequesting and master mission the rng if you arnt use to not get your way or just have really bad luck and can not take it when you lose then this game be probably not for you since it be system think it be possible to find out what area to grind for certain item it be 50 chance a big part of the game be skill base but if do not get the item you need your not go to get far and almost everytime give up on the character to start a new and see if that go better or if some well item will drop ofcourse on counter to that there be a market for trade so if you get coin community get ware 7 10for be the good grinding game for list to music d love,pos
early access reviewwhile its not perfect the core of the game be fun there be many thing go wrong but there be ton more thing do right one of the most important aspect of open world pvp be do right its fun and engage to fight in dispute zone this game be fun i have over 90 hour log so its already be worth it for me no matter what happen to it,pos

early access reviewworst magic the gathering clone i have ever play minimum deck size be 75 card which make the ratio of get your good card small than in other ccgs mana flood seem to be bad in this game than other i have play i enjoy the influence mechanic but other than that you can find in other game just about anything you find in this one play infinity war play hex play mtg play anything but this waste of time,neg
early access reviewfractured space put everything we love about space game and pvp like wot this may not have the super deep universe of the mmo space game come out like star citizen but it be simplicity be what make you wanna play match after match use all kind of tactict to crush your enemys the possibility of combat be limitless with this game massive capital ship battle with coordinated teamwork and amazing effect fractured space be the online game of year and worth double than what it be charge this be a no brainer,pos
early access reviewwhat be you wait for 2 more day remain to get this game for free its in alpha and have some bug but have be pretty fun you have not play a real br game till you get pan by someone wear bunny slipper and winged kneepad of speed,pos
get to say for a moba this game be quite nice could never really get into mobas until i play this do not have much time log in on this version yet but have put at least 9 day of playtime into the xbox one version it be a very addicting game and have well write lore on the different god character from the many different pantheon have very simple control and can be play with various gamepad controller that make them even simpler also the in game tutorial be very detailed and helpful for those who be new to the game another thing i like about this game be that although you can use microtransaction to purchase character skin vp etc you can also still earn the two different type of in game currency simply by play the game allow you to still purchase most of the forementioned thing above all in all it be a very fun and addictive game to play alone or with friend,pos
early access reviewreally fun game and a unique addition to the battle royale genre highly recommend no this be not a fortnite clone about the only similarity be 1 it be a battle royale game which fortnite do not start 2 the art style which fit the general art style of hi rez games 3 you shoot people unfortunately due to be in alpha it have be off to a rocky start it be by no mean unplayable however a lot of the community seem to forget it be alpha and then stop play when something change that they do not agree with this show itself in the long queue time in the australian server atleast on the flip side hi rez choose to make it an open alpha so they need to be mindful of not burn their already fragile community with major gameplay change becuase they may never claw them back,pos
can i say its more fun than some other tank game because it be very recommanded even for a free game at least i do not have to boot my window 10 pc to play the game now i can play it on window 7,pos
when i first purchase this game i be think this be go to be some kind ofmemory game and well it be but it be so much more first off this be a memory game but not just any memory game it be a game about disassemble reassemble and even remember how each gun be take apart and put back together with without use the guide this game be really about remember the order in which you have to assemble the part there be also a shooting range for each gun so you get an idea on how to use the gun as well as teach you how to spare your ammo for each target and on how you can learn to use each gun on aim handle and even practice on move target one thing to note about this game be that although it be call world of gun it be not just about gun there be also section of the game that let you disassemble and reassemble skeleton army vehicle tank humvee sport car and even a harley during the course of play the game you also get some really neat info about each weapon vehicle and skeleton detail about the make model history concept and what go into make each weapon what i like most about this game be how well detailed the designer put into make each part of every weapon someone do some serious homework on this game base on how many part each gun have i find this game not only fun but also informative and even help me to learn to respect weapon learn how the mechanic and inside work be the good part about his game i have read some other review and they seem to claim that some part of the game be too hard although i can somewhat understand this be more of a memory game as each gun vehicle skeleton as an order in which it be assemble so you have to remember the order of the part in order to get a good score this be a memory game not so much a shooter game some gun have as much as 100 part to remember while a few gun only have say 20 30 part every part have it be place every part must also be do in a certain order so you got to use your head more than use your speed once you know how the part go speed will follow this be be a trial and error game as well as memory game if you like memory game this be a good game to get warn although this game be free you can purchase download content which open up all the area of the game or you can purchase experience point as well as credit to open up only a few select area you only start out with 1 gun at the beginning and must earn experience and credit to open up other area of the game you earn experience and credit when you complete task on each gun,pos
the game be very balanced during staged battle no effect on the war however like in real war war mission be not usually balance you can buy whatever you want for the game because it will not affect it so it be not a pay2win game if you work as a group and build up a defensive or offensive strategy you will probably win it be not about money but teamwork i can highly and bravely recommend this game to everybody,pos
this game have lead to alot of moment for me alot of them be hilarious whether that be me be a noob or not in the situation be a different story i still love play this game for the fact that there be still a ton of stuff i have yet to try some of my freind have ask me advice and to be quite honest even with 1000 hour i still feel like a major noob the big thing i mention be try out the silly thing you can think of get rid of tradtional thought about character steriotype be important i feel i also love how with 1000 hour the craft system atleast for me have be always a touch out of my reach for the challange leagues i mean would deffinetly reccomend to arpg fan update the game be head in a new direction currently mechanic be get rework new system be get implement and they be do away with replay the game 3 time over and add one single playthrough i still reccomend the game just think i would post an update that change seem to be on the way for well or bad,pos

early access reviewjust go to throw this out there first off some review be actually corret after read about a page or two of review i decide to try it regardless think it may be a knock off battlefield 1942 and it kind of be in some sense it be fun at first until you reach rank 3 and then it all change it turn into a completely pay 2 win game you do not stand a chance if you do not own tank plane pilot tank crew man along with anti tank vehicle weapon maybe it be just me try to stay loyal and play with only my us troop when germany be clearly stack and get a lot more benefit in the war such as two spawn point more life and their gun seem slightly well in general all in all i give this game a 2 5 it have have a lot of potential but as most f2p fps game it fall on p2w in the end or really in the near start so enjoy your rank 0 3 trial then do not bother unless you have get money to throw away,neg
first off i have a fear of the paranormal so this kind of game be effectively my bad enemy that be why i decide to start off with spookys house of jump scare it be a seemingly cute and cuddly parody of modern horror game where you travel around a massive mansion full of terrifying monster for the first few minute you wonder why you though of get it for the next few hour you be run for your life from the freaky thing ever think cardboard cutout be not scary just wait,pos
early access reviewyou crave for smash brawl kinda game but you only own pc rest assure since there be an alternative for that and it be call brawlhalla folk it be still in early access but heck you could get a lot of fun from this and it be free too so on to the review not pay 2 win you could unlock all character by just play a lot what be cash for then vanity item makesyou a lot cool but do not affect the gameplay at all and the default character do not worry since there be a lot to choose from and they be not weak compare to the pay character at all a lot of legendarie it be the term for the character in this game yeah there be a lot of character and each one have their own unique playstyle require timing and skill it be not just your ordinary button spamming game folk timing be require here so it could be count as competitive fighting game the bgm sound really catchy and fit the game and again it be free folk so that be it now for the people who crave to brawl what be you wait for try it asap,pos
you can get cheat out of your purchase i buy gold and pay 49 99 and it never show up in my game and they claim everything be ok on their end and refer me to a third party game developer which get me nowhere,neg
early access reviewthis game be greate and the creator love to listen to their comunity i would highly recommend check the game update note and news at,pos
i really love this game untill it go down the sh er lemme explain so throughout the entire time i have play this game which be long than i have on my steam acount russian plane be and still be know as the most op s t ever well cmon the dev can change it if you present historical evidence well it have be do and you know what the dev say it be just anti russian propoganda it seem like gaijin be stick with this whole nationalism thing even into a game now let talk about the community it seem like gaijin do not even f ing know it exist i mean cmon if you promise something at least make something for example gaijin promise bomber interior for a long time pass a couple year later we have new airplane new tank new map and everything but f cke what they promise i have long stop play this game for myself i only sometimes boot it up to play with my friend but other than that i be really do with this game i would not recommend this game to anybody that want historical accurracy or fair matchmaking or anybody who like to communicate with the dev,neg
i like this game and after read the review i have to disagree with many of them about have to already be a fan of gun i see many potential way to have fun in the game and in the end even if you do not have any fun assemble disassembling and operate the gun the game have to offer there be other model in the game include skeleton car and motorcycle really there be quite a bit of fun to be have if you go into the game look at it like a puzzle sim game and you may even learn something about the way gun operate and how they be manufacture and or assemble if that be the sort of thing for you you should also know there be statistic and info for each gun available if you want to know more information about whatever one you be interested in not all aspect of the game be enjoyable at least for me after a point you will hit grind unless you pay and grind be the polar opposite of fun most if not all of the time there be also a requirement for some content to invite friend to the game now i know that it may not sound bad to need to invite friend to play the game but if your like me and most of your steam friend do not play these type of game you will run into an issue fairly quickly even if your friend will play you do not want to end up look like a spamming jerk do you in the end i think you should just download the game yourself ts pretty small so it should not take long and try it after all only you can tell if you like it,pos
i play it for a few hour the control be kinda clunky and the community be very toxic and faction be unbalancedthey make the us and ussr fight each other which make no sense but this be just my problemthis game suck as fascism 10,neg
early access reviewthe game use to be really good and addicting but the new update absolutely ruin the game unbalanced it and take away the fun of actual design no longer worth play uninstalle and never look back,neg
hey guy well i be sorry but i be go to have to list some thing that be bad but let start with the good thing pro 1 get to ride a dragon free roam2 train a dragon also get to race on it 3 this game be kinda good for unity personal p4 clan clan give you the choice to feel good about your self or bad depend on the rank 5 battle event they actually give you a chance to earn gem dragon egg or farm item or even mystery box d6 animation update at least every 3 weekscon 1 some animation be severly broken2 graphic from the elder scroll 3 morrowind so pretty bad my eye 3 quest that make you pay money to buy a gronkle wtf4 no dialogue option to choose what you wanna say instead of go along with it on quests5 clan hacking account hack i be scared as i be a top racer well know and in a top clan 6 chat filter they be just plain annoying you can not say bruh but you can say drug with dot inbetween 7 we need cashhhh to please ze senpai jumpstart 2016 have to buy gem for basically anything i hope this help you with future development animal arithmetic,pos
early access reviewa winter battle royale worth tryingby no mean be ring of elysium a perfect game but it be a unique take on the br genre with the wonderful price of free the badi would say the bad part about the game be the sound design hardly anything sound like it be suppose to or sound cheap but really mechanically the game be great and the graphic be decent enough the goodthe style of the game be excellent i love the winter ski resort theme and the ability fly board or zipline my way around the map vehicle and basic loot be plentiful but the ymir storm be ruthless and only give you about a minute before you start lose your toe gunplay be solid and i look forward to what they will add to the game overall a great experience i highly recommend grab a few of your friend and give it a try,pos
start play story mode all the way up to the final level chapter 20 and after six fail attempt be never able to beat it i spend well over an hour in total after my first loss building and rebuilding deck to try to find a combination that would allow me to finally complete story mode to no avail video of other who have beat it either a get lucky or b use more powerful card than i have receive possibly purchase i e pay to win find no acceptable solution to break through the wall that be the tutorial for this game i be out boring game not worth the time,neg
early access reviewthey patch my favorite glitch be i could prone into a corner of a bunker and clip into the wall of the bunker and stab people foot when they enter the bunker now i have nothing to do becide win game and that s boring please let me prone into corner again,neg
i play it with keyboard its not that great i think you need a steering wheel for this game the movment of the steering look reaally weird if you use keyboard the graphic be very nice menu and webpage be awesome i wait until xmas then i will give it another shoot with my steering wheel,pos
for a free game it be good and i enjoy the slow pace and thrill of kill other player when they come along the present company seem to care about the game and constantly update it so i would recommend it,pos
early access reviewi pay about 100 usd and climb to gold rank in two week with the win rate of 70 or so but decide to quit because the game play be not fun pro it be fun to brew your own deck if you be rich enough to build sufficient card collection the card that utilize the void use spell and dead creature pool and those that manipulate the deck like warcry give 1 1 to the next card you draw create a significantly great space for deck variety con the playing itself be very dull and rng heavy and frustrating if you do not draw the right combination of power mana in the first few turn you can not play any card and just watch your opponent beat you up if both player manage to draw the right power then the match be decide base on who get to draw more threat and answer if the opponent play tavrod for 2 turn and you only have 1 removal you lose if the opponent be aggro and you do not have lightning storm aoe removal by turn 3 you lose if the opponent be chalice a weapon that buff small creature and draw you card and you can not burn him in the first few turn you lose if your deck be base on reanimate the void and the opponent just happen to play a steward of the past which retroactively silence everything in your void on top of have a good stat on its own you lose at the mulligan phase you have absolutely no information on what kind of deck the opponent be play so you just blindly mulligan for power in hearthstone you know the opponent class so you can make an educated guess as to what card will be effective in eternal you never know if you should keep the lightning storm match be very snow bally one sided and rng i feel whatever i do or the opponent do have no bearing on the outcome you can try and play for free but be warn when you have enough card to build an optimize deck when your threat demand answer and you can include as many hard removal as the meta call then the game have become a dice roll i will come back only if they change the power system,neg
it be toxic game new comer be not welcome here there be just too much toxicitymy last game a hero name viper ask me whether or not be this my first game i say yes it be my firsthe say it be lose he give up what kind of people exist if i progress further then in the upcoming game i see people leave the game many without any reason how be i suppose to enjoy this,neg
it be addictive educational and fun unfortunately your click sometimes do not register and the order you have to do thing in be often illogical counterintuitive i have also have some trouble connect to the server but that may just be a problem on my end all in all worth it just to get a look at the inside of the various gun you have be shoot for year across dozen of game edit connectivity be a lot well now,pos
early access reviewonly good if you be a new player never do anything for player that be veteran and there match making be really bad i be in a match with 2 2000 cpu people and not a single one of us be above of 1000 and they win cause of that gj dev,neg
pay for convenience around every corner lack story drive campaign esspecially at level 70 you will find most be daily weekly to complete or pay this to complete them early combat system be not terrible ultimate feel powerful but it could also be see as boring or unskillful compare to other mmos simplistic rotation,neg
this game be really bad take me 100 hour to realize this game be crap crash all the time have a lot o bug bad optimization only play it for nostalgia but it be not enough anymore,neg
why be this game on steam you can not really lose and there be wait timer and no real money to manage its fallout themed but that be it it have microtransaction as well that make it mobile game have to stay off steam,neg
this be pure simulator with almost none of virtual help it be all up to you and your driving style i love that in simulator when they just put you in action and leave you to learn about the game through the gameplay when i start play i think this game be all about pay for extra stuff yea it be expensive as hell but its a good game sure only 1 fictional track for use be terrible the sound be awesome and so be the physics first feel 6 10gameplay 9 10controller support 9 10physics 9 10 drive 10 10 crash physics 10 10 crash damage 3 10 sound 11 10price 3 10overall game experience 9 10 very fun but very expensive and a lot of locked stuff ruin the fun gameplay especially if you have to pay for every car and track edit most of the competition lend you everything neccessery for race so you can explore new car and track that feature be very good,pos
a lot of people may say its another minecraft game but this one be an action mmorpg what you basically only build be your own homebase where other player can shelter from monster and resupply on potion and dismantle their loot for material to progress in the game its completely open world and explore be a great satisfaction to do you pretty much explore the world find dungeon find ore beat boss get loot dismantle useless loot get material complete quest recieve wing mount skin for your equipement i have be play this with my friend for a while and we be have so much fun while play it each time we go to a new world level it get more challenging and explore get more rewarding it can get repetitive when you need to go to dungeon though but everything else be fun also the game remind me of skyrim but blocky,pos
poe d3this be a throw back to the diablo 2 day of gameplay quick and to the point just with well graphic and a more complex spell system totally worth check out if you miss the old d2 day and yes definately worth play over diablo 3 imho if you have not pay for diablo 3 yet then check out path of exile it just may convince you to save your hard earn money on a title worth pay for do i mention that path of exile be free to play note 5 year after review this every point still stand not only do i keep come back to this game but the content update be also neverende still free still good still well than d3,pos

entretenido y divertido hasta que llegas a tener todo y no puedes conseguir el ultimo logro por que simplemente porque tienes que pagar o jugar muchisimas horas e ir abriendo tarteras farmeadas en las misiones calculo que unas 1000 horas para conseguir todos los munequitos legendarios lo recomiendo hasta que consigas todo los desbloqueos dentro del juego y tengas un refugio estable no lo recomiendo si vas buscando todos los logros no hace falta comprar nada para poder tener todo lo del juego menos los legendarios,pos
this may be the only time to actually waste money on this game consider the 70 off otherwise the amount of money spend on this game just to collect car and track be ridiculous for what you end up with compare to their old title and hate to through in console but fm and gt game then not to mention the upcoming project car which i be part of and be in my opinion stunning and love the the work those guy be put into their new game project car,neg
two year ago i would have recommend this game now i can not i do not have experience with other flight simulator if you can call war thunder a simulator so i can not say whether the game be realistic and use accurate flight model or not but i can tell you that the game at it be current state be mostly not fun to play and the developer seem to try to make the game more unfun with each update there be two main reason for this the grind and the un balance in order to research a new plane you have to invest a certain amount of research point towards it which you earn by play match when you finish research the plane you can buy it with ingame currency buy the plane be not actually an issue as you always have enough money do not sound too bad until you see the number at the start of the game it be not too bad a low tier plane cost around 9000 rp research point or less and you can earn at least 1000 per match if you do well that be 9 game fair enough the problem be that rp requirement for plane get exponentially big and big while the game only let you earn about the same amount each game to get a tier 4 plane the game have 5 tier the fw 190 d9 for example you will need 89 000 rp while you be only able to earn 1200 rp on average that be about 75 game for one plane and each game take about 20 minute that mean you need to grind for 25 hour for 1 plane want to get a jet play 500 match the game do not reward you for play well either even if you eliminate several player every match and even if you be the mvp the game will only give you a pitiful 2000 3000 rp at most it be a little well but the difference be almost not noticeable on top of that gaijin the dev keep add more filler plane to the game that no one ask for those plane be virtually identical version of plane already ingame and i can think of no reason to add them other than as a way to slow the grind even further they could have at least make research them optional but in order to advance in the tech tree you have to research say plane this mean that you will find yourself finally research a plane after many hour only to find it be the same as and maybe even a bad version of the previous plane so to get to the plane you want double at least the amount of time i mention earlier because you have to chew through a bunch of useless plane first gaijin could not care less about this issue and have in fact reduce the amount of rp earn significantly over the year rp gain have be reduce over time by approximately 99 not even kid since i start play this be also why i have such a large number of hour play on this game because have it be this way since the beginning i would have quit very quickly this make progress the game a painful experience and it be why i quit play it now the second issue balance this one be a less issue to me because i do not play game for historical matchup the game use a system call battle rating to match different plane together in a battle a plane battle rating be suppose to reflect its ability over its opposition a combination of the plane armament speed and such thing plane with a similar battle rating will be match together the problem be that the battle rating system make no sense and simply do not work you will see plane from 1943 face plane from 1941 and plane from 1941 face plane from even 1937 plane that be rarely fly in real life be use en masse in the game against plane that never see them in combat and be perhaps obsolete by that time keep in mind that world war 2 last 6 year and so a 2 year difference be huge also keep in mind that most of the plane that fight aircraft old than them in the game actually match their opposition well enough in real life the result be that a large majority of the plane ingame be borderline useless because at the same battle rating there be more effective plane and they be outperform by their opposition which probably never fight them in real life some plane be mediocre and some be blatantly overpowered at their battle rating if i feel like seal clubbing i can just take out my he 112 a0 f2a buffalo or almost any spitfire of choice there be more option and easily get up to 10 kill per match in realistic battle because my opposition simply stand no chance in their plane of course i would get next to no reward for this but i sure would make a lot of people frustrate in the case of the he 112 a0 the game think this plane should be match against biplane which simply stand no chance against a pilot who know what he be do on the other hand the entire heavy fighter and bomber line in all nation be nearly completely useless bomber and heavy fighter be free kill to any pilot who know his stuff in realistic battle a tiny amount of exception do exist some fighter be completely helpless against their enemy while some even a monkey can use and be an ace similar problem occur throughout the entire tech tree of all 5 nation so why do these matchup exist that you can ask only gaijin which if ask would delete your post and tell you there be no such thing as balance issue in war thunder this bring me to the final part of this review the developer any of the above will likely never be fix the developer only feedback about the game come through the forum they do not read the english forum and it be up to the community management team to take care of the user input the way the forum be manage by those moderator honestly give off a cold war communist regime vibe anything that may be percieve as disagreement with the way gaijin do certain thing or as a complaint about a major issue in the game be deal with in a similar way the post delete the poster maybe ban and if enough people complain about the issue that gaijin have to address it they will claim it simply do not exist there be many more problem with the game that i have not mention because i have not experience them personally simulator bomber abuse no such thing accord to gaijin despite plenty of video evidence the balance of jet era fighter the ground force aspect of the game in general i be not sure if the developer themselves do not care about the quality of the game or if the community manager simply do not pass over the feedback either way the developer think the game be fine as it be and keep release more filler plane more ridiculous battle rating change that make no sense almost as if their goal be to take what fun be leave away from the game everything work perfectly well in gaijin land comrade except it do not tl dr if you have a lifetime to spend grind and you do not mind the terrible dev and balance issue play this game it be free after all but it be a waste of your time,neg

early access reviewup until about a week ago this game be great the economy change single handedly ruin it however there be no need for me to re hash it here since the other thousand of negative review will do a far well job of that but it suck to play out a 15 minute game and earn next to nothing regardless of your performance in the battle you will have to grind literally about 100 15 minute game to earn a single high end module which you will need to do several time in order to build one decent high end robot this game be absolutely not worth your time,neg

due to the immense amount of positive review for this game few will read this and even few will listen however i simply can not reccomend a game that run at 18 25 frame on damn near the low setting while anything truly important be go on especially when the spec of my computer 12 gb ram fx 8350 gtx 750 ti clearly be superior to the reccomended system requirement of the game there be time where i get framerate closer to 40 60 however these time be few and far between and only take place in desolate area without player vehicle or even the simple structure i have other complaint about this game although i be sure other negative review already cover them so i will leave it to fellow dissapointed player to voice their opinion on the matter i be sadden by my experience with the game especially due to how fun it seem it would be if it be to run properly at least it be free,neg
early access reviewi do not know how i get into this game to be honest i can not even remember go in all i can remember be my character wake up on the second floor of an abandon house just outside the town where i live and that i be wear some soldier clothe the name of the soldier be karl muller i know this because i could read the name tag on the jacket all this seem very weird to me but i decide to just go back home and figure out everything there i need to get out of those clothe i do not want to be confused with someone else just as i be walk down i hear someones whistle and an engine run outside the house when i step outside i see a man wear some weird look green uniform run towards a funny look green small vehicle and leave i decide to steal a bicycle that be sit right in front of the house and go for a ride through the field i figure it be the short way home as i be make my way along the river i hear a loud noise in the wood and then a clicking noise metal on metal right afterwards i get off the bike and take protection behind a tall tree and all i remember be that i be very scared i take a minute to look around and see where that noise be come from then i see it it be that man wear the green uniform he be lie on the floor have a really long rifle and he be look down to a wooden barn across the field it be a long way but i see some man run in and out of that barn they be wear a dark grey uniform much like the one i be wear and look desperate it be almost as if they be run for their life then the man shoot another bullet with his rifle it be so loud that i have to cover my ear then i look towards the barn and see one of those soldier lie on the floor motionless the other soldier be nowhere to be find and i remember feel sorry for that guy i ask myself why do this happen why that sadness i feel for the guy quickly turn into anger but to myself i feel rage and resentment to my cowardly action this anger take control over myself and make me grab a shovel i have in my procession do not know where it come from and smash it into that mans head there be nothing he could do i think it take one or two hit but by the time i be do he be no long part of this world i grab his rifle and see a complete different world through that scope i see tank and loud fighter airplane i see man in dark gray and green uniform run everywhere i see them fight over abandon house bridge and other sector i see dead body fly several hundred meter up in the air i see a man on a motor bike run over three young soldier and then explode after hit a tree i see smoke and hear loud explosion all the thing i see i see them through the scope of this rifle a rifle i do not pay for then i quickly realize that i be a real soldier and that i be send to this free to play war to see all this epic thing and to recommend this game to you there be a free to play soldier in all of us 10 10 would steal your scope car bike and tank from you again,pos
this be a game that look good by this page but have an overwhelming amount of microtransaction and a really unwelcoming community where you need to be a pay member to create a multiplayer map and you be able to password lock game but many do not and will just kick you after you spend five minute load in,neg
decent game that can be fun at time and be a good way to kill some time stay interesting as the game be frequently update and their be many possible build along with many skill point though most of them be passive be very good and allow many playthrough of the game very similar to diablo 2 and 3 can rival both of them which be amazing and suprising due to path of exile be a free to play i recommend this game and think it be good apart from sometimes it can be boring and dull as some of the level can get confusing and feel like a massive maze this can add to the game at time aswell though but some of the game other feature make up for this,pos
do you like action rpg like diablo 2 torchlight and titan quest yes then look no futher than path of exile this game be free to play in every sense of the word all money you can potentially spend be on cosmetic and stash if you want more or a dedicated currency stash tab that hold much big stack if you like it it be worth support them as they have make an enjoyable game that never hound you to spend money one playthrough will take around 20 25 hour to get through the original 3 act but they have add up to chapter 10 now so who know how long it take now the big difference with this game as oppose to other action rpgs be that the skill you have be tie to gem that you pick up and then slot into armor weapon these gem level up by you use them you can unslot them and then reslot other gem as you see fit they maintain their level this allow you to really experiment with build while not be restrict to specific skill or armor just give it a go you will like it personal progress record 67 hour ranger level 50 act 5maurdaer level 9scion level 6templar level 20shadow level 16duelyst level 1witch 37 hardcore mode character ranger level 1 pvp character,pos

early access reviewfun game but every time i get on it take a few minute to find a match tdm be really the only thing be play take a while to get in game currency for new gun btw have not really come across any hacker not sure why so many complaint,pos
immediatly fun because space ship hide depth and strat abound the grind feel like alot at first but you quickly get ship and crew that you enjoy each ship feel very different the crew you choose can add alot of personality to your ship as well with sometimes badass other time funny commentary and live combat response it do not just feel like drive an empty lifeless ship through empty lifeless space combat be mostly slow and methodical with burst of of intense heavy firing action when both team be on point the battle be extremely rewarding its a game where position be everything predict enemy movement while also try to win rock paper scissor while at the same time you can be on the lose end of a type matchup and still come out on top with superior piloting and alot of heart the dev seem to not only love play there game but be rather active with update which be a mega plus,pos
early access reviewfun game well opimize and come with free spyware installation that you do not agree to instal that you have to spend half of your day remove from your computer also feature an involuntary peer to peer update system that without your permission or knowledge use your bandwith to seed to other peer computer welcome to the botnet,neg
i watch the ad look cool the part they miss out be the 10 hour of walking and the part where it go whoops you need to pay to shoot that rock nonono you need a licence to climb that what be you do you need a licence to shoot that bug well i end up shoot myself and i need a licence for that 0 10 just do not get this stupid game,neg
smite be an moba but i probably do not have explain what a moba be in smite you play as various god of mythology and diffrent pantheon smite have some wacky and fun gamemode smite be a game that be more fun to play with friend and now over to the pro and conspros good look skin thirdperson nice look map god from various mythology the art of the item the game have some good joke up it sleeve the nice reffrenes it be free to play clear animationscon people that can not communicate balance can be a bit well thirdperson this be for the people that play diffrent mobas that be top down deul break meta toxi player and salty enemy server stability be pretty bad matchmking be time to time break gem freemium currency of this game be a bit expensivei rate this game 8 10 it need some change but it be pretty fun,pos
world okay moba edit i quit the game and uninstalle beware the community be cancer bad most of the time you will be fight your teammate in the chat rather than enemy god on the field mute everyone and you will be fine,pos
the game it be good and dev too and here be why very fun to play at start so satisfying when you get kill if you finish like first five mission u get 1000 gold that be pretty decent variety of tank the only con for me the game get a little bit bored after you get a few of good tank,pos
not really design for casual gamer but can still be fun on the normal server if you want the most out of the game do ample preparation look up build or use the provide skill tree on the website to make your own it seem intimidating at first but honestly it be so worth it the sheer possibility of build this game provide be incredible you pay money only for cosmetic so there be absolutely no pay to win aspect in poe have not try the pvp because the pve be so engaging but i will do it sometime my hour be not reflect on steam i start way before i download this on steam i have play 5 hc character to their death and a couple normal character before that 10 10,pos
only one campaign once its do you have to buy the first part of a new campaign for 1000 coin which be hard to get or cave in and waste your money you also have to use coin or waste money to play the arena and pvp arena pay to win,neg
early access reviewokay listen up this game it be a whirlwind i play it a while ago and can tell you it be pretty fun now that do not mean i would have recommend this game over counter strike even for the free price tag but it be fun broken and fun after an mmmmm 5 month hiatus i have come back to it and no surprise whatsoever it get bad before i get into that i be go to tell you what they have go for them break spawn trap unbeleiveabley unbalanced gun small and crowded map and sub par server okay graphic like ps2 now they try to fix that spawn protection the gun have be balance on the edge of a cliff with everything on one side new map server that no longer tell you your ping now you be leave wonder if that knife death be because you be lag or because the game decide that a ten foot knife be now in the game graphic that make my computer couch and weeze when i try to load it in 720p early ps1the game when i get it be a mixture of cs go and c o d and it be break beyond belief but it be fun you could go 80 0 with your friend and not care about anything it may be early access but i do not think that go backwards be how you make a game i know that i be rambe but i guess this could be gear more towards the maker of the game if you see this go back a few month figure out what you want with this game and build from there for those of you that feel like get this game before cs go do not get csgo first and then ty this game out drop a thirty bomb in casual or tdm then get the game,neg
early access reviewreally amazing game i buy it a few day ago and i be hook the game run very smooth and the gameplay be quite fun and engage in addition at least playing in pubbie lobby ship seem to be fairly balanced and it feel like every ship play quite different from the other this game play a lot like world of tank or world of warship but with spaceship and with a 3d range of movement however it also have moba esque quality of have multiple lane and have to push defensive structure to kill your enemys main base what make this very enjoyable be the fact that you have to position shoot and maneuver your ship on a micro level to defeat your enemy but you also have to make sure that your overall map positioning and timing be good on a team level as well i e make sure your team arrive at gamma together and on time make sure you be defend base when the enemy have access etc it can be a little daunting at first but the learning curve be not too steep especially if you have play mobas and understand positioning timing etc tldr great game play like a mixture of world of tank warship combine with a moba esque style,pos
yay for ruin this awesome game way to go you guy go to lose player one by one after spend a few awesome hour play and enjoy this game it be ruin by the new patch greedyhead i do not belive you will make more money if you lose a bunch of player i do not recomment this game for any newcomer,neg
if you love build and craft you should definitely give this game a try i love the community aspect and the adventure that you can explore and or build be lovely you can have a world all to yourself or share it with other you can create blueprint of your build to share with other it never cease to amaze me how ingeniously people use the block to create incredible build the seasonal event be fun too and good of all the dev be still work on the game so new stuff be come out several time a year all in all a lovely game to express your creativity,pos
its a good game i have be play for 2 year almost and damn i be glad i play this game when i do i make sooooooooo many ing friend have ton of fun but it have its down side pvp be a mess tbh ton of people be bad sport dungeon be just too long at point and it feel like pay to win at time alot of people be jerk and ya but there be always the good people in this game which really tbh be not many i be lucky to find them and if you do find them game get alot well but this game have some boring part too grind get really boring at time and event be long and boring at time u get to work uroff to get the event item which sometimes be not worth it but in all and all i have fun and that s what matter so yeah if you ever need someone to play elsword with just gimme a call and ill join ya if i get the time xd,pos
this be one of the most rage induce game i have ever play but somehow i still get drag back into play it example you will grind for like 4 8 and then have good tiered stuff and your mind be like ahhh finally i have make a charcter that will live forevr and then pretty much after you start get those thought just get off because your gunna e die the next second the moment after die be the bad becasue your either super salty or in rage mode because of decas server in a duegeon lag and can not close realm and then 5 second later the server be abck and then ohh your dude that you spend hour on be just e dead not even because of you its casue of deca this game be so weird when you get mad you get offand your basically be call the game trash but somehow you contiounsly get drag back in this game this game be highly addicting one you start to grasp how to play i would recommend get start everything be pretty much pay to win because you have to buy a good pet you have to my space in your vault you have to buy everything and sadly i have spend money and i regret it because it just make me want to play more so i can get my ing money worth would not recommend,neg
okay let me start by say a couple of thing one yes i absolutely recommend this game two yes the payment model be an absolute mess and some thing that be pay be just silly however under say payment model there be also a lot misconception mostly concern license and ammo due to a lack of explanation on the dev end and also youtuber do review on game that they have play for 8 minute and 7 second allow me to break it all down for you the payment model and membership let me just start by say that i be not here to defend this business model because it be atrocious and be not my favorite by a long shot i know there be a lot of player that will not try this game because of half cocked review and lack of explanation expansive world this be also your fault do not charge for trophy shot pose cmon okay okay the store ugh yes every weapon pretty much be pay heres the thing you do not need every weapon out of the gate that be just silly so the way it work be hunterscore hunterscore be a base on a total point count that come from reach various milestone your first kill be your first milestone per weapon and per specie from there you be give point to your score for 25 50 100 250 500 and 1000 kill yes every weapon apart from a few exclusive that do not contribute to the score require 1000 kill to achieve the maximum hunter score so day one you want to try the game out and feel overwhelmed by the amount of weapon for sale that be normal even the start 243 require 1000 kill start with it it take a long time to get that 1000 kill max it and get another weapon every 2 3 week or buy everything in the game at once and send your wife into a coma like i do let me explain why that be pointless i own all the thing cool except it be not i now have 18 52 11 rifle that have 1 30 kill each and the chance that i will reach 1000 with them be now so low that my brother can not even walk under them he be short point get a weapon or two and go with them for the first while okay b00 m i buy a weapon but there be no way i be go to keep buy ammo for it when it run out that be where the membership come in it be 9 99 for 3 month it be not that bad what make it bad be all of the other stuff in unison clothing weapon scent eliminator with that membership your ammo will not run out each rifle pistol and bow come with 30 round or arrow 150 for the 22 and 17 birdshot for a shotgun come with 90 those number be per hunt once they be go they be only go for that hunt start up another and you will see it right back in your lodge but it be not enough ammo for a hunt yes yes it be stop shoot hole in the cloud and try to saw down tree with arrow it be not help if you be send 30 round through a 243 in 15 minute then you be do it wrong if you shoot that bad at a walking target you should be spend your time at the range and not in the field cool i be not buy a license for each animal either no well neither be i because that be stupid on 318 level if you buy one for an animal then i be not call you stupid thaw out snowflake and keep read that same membership take care of that as well if you want to play one hunt a month and have a life outside of game then the individual license may be more practical for you long term player should not be touch those silly thing as far as clothing and all the other stuff go listen up a lot of that be preference not all the outfit matter as each one have certain effect on certain animal it be not that drastic yes you will blend better with the appropriate camo but it will not be game break to play without it until you decide to get it i also buy all the clothing she be still hot that 400 hell tent stand and thing like that be quality of life if you want them buy them if not the game will not force close and take you to the store with it be hand out on a side note tent serve as spawn point and with the reserve be quite large i recommend a couple but that be entirely up to you i have probably skip out on 100 rare jump around the reserve walk from place to place be never a bad idea anyway caller caller be one of the more reasonably price item in the game compare to the other stuff but can still get a little expensive if all be buy at once nickel and dime from week to week or month to month and it be not bad also look at the caller bundle duck goose blind lol stay away from duck and goose until you be sure you want to stay for the long haul because a fowl setup be outright dumb as far as payment a blind and decoy spread can run you nearly 30 people that have travel across the country with 3 of their ex in the car have spend less money than us fowl hunter in this game ems and gms ems be pay and gms be earn and also a little on the useless side gms be great for thing like scent and scent eliminator but that be about the extent of it there be a few other thing which you can browse the store to see ems can also be earn by place in competition and from the uhc website where there be player make competiton and payout much high payout okay so i be interested in it now be it fun absolutely the sound visual and scope of the game be second to none as far as hunting game each animal be unique with it be very own score card that break down detail to level that i do not even bother read haha the reserve be large and the optional content be through the roof if not terribly overpriced play with friend join competion em payout and do missons gm payout listen if you read the review then i appreciate you take the time to do so if you still feel like it be too expensive to play then i totally understand that if you want to stick around and play then tinker with the free content before get a membership just remember that without a membership this game be lack and it be almost a requirement if you have any question or would like to be show the rope then i will always help a new player message me on steam and i will get you into my discord and get you go grab yourself a membership after some time and a weapon or two you will get out pretty cheap and still have a great experience until the next time you need to buy a thing expanisive world try to help me make this clear with a big red banner that say you be go to want a membership to enjoy this game the vid be mislead and it be hardly free to play you be kill your own review,pos
so i spend some time in the tutorial figure out the control then load up the dogfight mission 1 su 25 vs 2 a 10s sound like fun attempt the first i fire both aphid head on both track for flare we pass each other and start to turn and it be at this point that the ace combat reflex that loom threateningly in the dark corner of my mind whenever i boot up a flight sim decide to pounce i forget that i be fly an su 25 not an su 37 and attempt to execute a j turn it go poorly for detail on exactly how poorly it go see the verse about the passenger liner from the song albuquerque by weird al yankovick attempt the second i fail to achieve missile lock during the first pass and circle around we mauever for a while i manage to tag one of the warthog with my first archer and kill it with the second i manage to get behind the second warthog and fire both aphid both go for his flare i close to gun range and we enter the horizontal scissor i take a snapshot and miss just before i overshoot i hear him fire his gun and dive to try and evade several second later i notice two rather peculiar and alarming thing a my plane have decide that it want to be upside down now and will not take no for an answer and b i can not pull out of the dive approximately 3 72 second before i make an impressively large mess in some poor bastard wheat field i look behind me and notice that roughly two third of my plane have mysteriously vanish 10 10 would fail to notice get light up with a gau 8 all over again,pos
short review smite be a good moba for anyone who want to try one and for experienced player alike long review smite be a moba that be somewhat different from other it have a third person perspective that i personally like there be a wide range of character to choose from 70 at the time of this review along with the wide range of character be 6 different game mode there be 5 different character type to choose assassian which stick and move secure a kill warrior who be constantly in the fight hunter long range specialist for ranged attack mage who deal a variety of magical attack and lastly there be guardian who play support but can also deal a lot of damage the 6 different game mode differ quite a bit there be arena which be just a 5v5 deathmatch where your team try to kill the other and escort minion into the enemy portal reduce the enemy score to 0 win this game joust be a 3 on 3 mode that use teamwork to advance to your enemy titan to destroy it to win of course you must get through the enemy team tower and phoenix this be a one lane mode with buff for each team to pick up on either side assault be 5v5 one lane fight where you be randomly give a god and you and your team work your way to the enemy titan to destroy it similar to joust but you can not go back and buy equipment or item until you be dead seige be a 4v4 2 lane fight to destroy the oppose enemy titan this be more strategic than the other mode teamwork be almost always nescessary here conquest be the main game mode of smite it be a 5v5 3 lane strategy game the goal be to destroy the enemy team titan once again but teamwork and play your role be a nescessity in this mode conquest rely heavily on strategy overall smite be a fun game for me and i personally do not play many mobas there be a few minor issue i have some god play too similar the community can be toxic at time and the server can get overload at time as well but those be my big gripe i do recommend this game to anyone want to try a moba,pos
i would not call this a minecraft clone but more like a minecraft inspire game the animation be smooth i can run it on my crap pc with low detail and it still look nice the only issue i see be with a low resolution the gauntlet clip off the screen and the pay to win here be unreal if you want to see pay 20 buck and get a flashlight want to run longer pay 20 buck to double stamina want to fly pay 20 buck to get a glider want to have more than 1 world pay 20 buck do not make it free if you have to pay for all the feature,neg

early access reviewif you think hearthstone be way too simple then this be the good digital card game on the market compare to other game it also feel like it have a very generous f2p model where you can build up to tier 1 deck at a reasonable pace while some deck be undoubtedly well than other there be a plethora of viable deck build around many different interesting card so there should be something for everyone unless you expect pure jank to be t1 then you be probably out of luck you will win game even with janky combo though if you be willing to work for it,pos

early access reviewfirst off this game be far well than pubg and fortnite in my personal opinion i find it take everything wrong that be with pubg and just fix it and i find its well than fortnite cause honestly fortnite be just a prime example of a company sell out refer to epic kill paragon for fortnite and then release 12mil of asset for free on unreal just to say hey we be do with this we care more about money than our work so you all can finish the game but this review be not about those two game its about this one first impression be superb i really enjoy the character customization menu and the variety of clothing option you can preview beforehand now when i play on the beta it be not a snow map so this make me think they will be add seasonal map with a variety of pack to go with them now the big thing of this game be the pack system which i will give a pro and con of gliderpros good mobility pack ingame in term of move speed you can literally glide across the map the glock be nicecon i find you need to start in the mountain for this pack to shine as its limited to where you can use it low capacity start off so need to focus on find a backpack for max carry snowboardpros can be use almost anywhere uphill and downhill can cover great downhill distance medium mobility and medium capacity can do gnarly jumpscon you be limit to certain path it kind of contrict the pro i have mention but its a little hard to explain you would have to see for yourself rock climbing kit my personal fav pro can use ice axis to quickly skim up and down slope max start capacity the shotgun be decent zipline be motor drive so can be use up and down can jump off early at your own risk if you see incoming threat can cover long distance fastcon i find the rock climbing itself be very linear and there be not as many rock path as zipline zip post can be easily camp now that s out of the way i want to give more insight on the game it have hit marker it have bullet drop i find the gun be balance except for the fact that hip firing be so useless i would not recommend it the way you all spawn in the map be different than the traditional bus plane the map be divide by what i can roughly estimate a 30x30 grid its a guestimate i have not actually count and player can choose which square they want to go it light up to signify its take so can choose to fight right off the bat or do not the loot be not scarce at all you will always find something somewhere the 3 gun you can have i find be a little overkill but i be not complain all and all for an early access game and for me to pump out this much information in the 3 odd hour i play be just very entertaining this be my first review of any game please feel free to share your thought why you agree or disagree with the point i have make p s to the dev please look into the idea of make rock climbing kit a permanent thing it be so useful and i find it should be essential but so far love the game can not wait to see what s in store and potential console port cheer,pos

early access review do not waste your time on this game dev be terrible by balance the game they remove the only way to get money easily make you pay for color and add lock on missile and uzi gun and anti air cannon they also remove the ability to fire all of one type of gun cause you to spam the numberkey to fire like a freaking moba which they add moba mode be a game mode where you capture tower and destroy their base if give good money but the game be 10 30 min all the weapon cost around 200 000rp one 30 minute match get you around 90 000 if you lose most of the time cause you to grind for hour upon hour to get a good bot it be not always this way the game use to be super fair fun and the people on it do not steal each other work sorry rosefall but i see your bot way too much the megabots update be incredible it add a new challenge a way to get massive amount of money and once you get there it be a last after see how happy people be the demon at freejam then decide to remove them as it be make tdm unbalanced now all you see be missile carrier with lock on crap and practicly invinsible bot that only focus on shield and spamme the new uzi gun if freejam really want their fan and supporter back they will actually makde the game balance remove the lock on gun add back a way for steady income and make sure their update will not upset 70 of the people play this game,neg
early access reviewfirst off i have to say this be the good freaking brawler for pc i have play i honesly think i like it better then smash net code seem pretty solid i personaly have not experience much in the form of lag the control be tight and i have not notice balance issue bare new ledgend when they bring them in but that get flush out the only downside to this be the game buisness model i get into it with the all ledgend pack with that pack the micro transaction be all cosmetic but honestly i would be more than willing to drop the money for a full release cost on this and not have them in the game at all the skin be cool look but frankly just not worth it at the current cost i do not say this to rag on the game i say this because i love the game and i think it would be so much well as a traditional game or at least a skin pack,pos
early access reviewpros it be aq freaking 3d it be not too laggynot p2w yet con not a lot of class compare to aqw long level up timeweird camera angle my preference overall 8 10 would play more when they add class and more way to get exp fast,pos
even nearly 5 year after its release it be still one of the good game out there and be still very much alive with many large 100 people battle regardless of several people say that it be die or dead because that will not happen for a very long time it be free to play and be not pay to win you can easily defeat those with superior equipment if you know how to do so fun infantry combat with a variety of class which all have their own use and importance on the battlefield a variety of vehicle and air asset with customisable weaponry equipment and ability to fit role that you desire such as aa tank or ammo resupply sunderer each faction have some unique vehicle and weapon specific to them which be more of less balanced you have the ability to make your own basis though this be something the map or continent be huge basis vary in importance and have lattice link so there be a sense of progression when take them and involve strategic think any minor event such as sneak around your enemy on foot and destroy a sunderer can have a significant impact of the battle for the entire continent which can give exhilarating feeling there be many organised outfit and platoon on every server with every faction that be friendly and willing to take on new player but also there be the freedom to play solo play how you wish to if you be willing to pay for them there be a wide range of cosmetic that give you the ability to stand out out of the 800 hour i have play this 200 hour before realize it be on steam i have only ever encounter 1 hacker who be in a fly max which be in 2014 they have implement an anti cheat software to mostly prevent this further so hacker be rampant not a chance update be few but do happen do not help that daybreak be not exactly an extremely wealthy game company so they be limit in their ability to do massive overhaul on a frequent basis bug and glitch occasionally occur such as touch a vehicle wreck with your own vehicle cause yours to explode and get out of a vehicle in an awkward place such as a very narrow gorge can make you fall through the map sometimes people on your own faction grief and tk or have an overwhelming desire to get a pointless revenge such as accidently run someone over in a vehicle or kick them out of your vehicle then a minute later they c4 fire rocket at or throw tank mine at you especially annoying when you be in the process of deploy a sunderer somewhere or be advance with a mbt which waste nanite for a vehicle heavy person like me traitor like these be more of an important issue than hacker imo,pos
card game be for sure my favorite digital collectible trading card game ccg tcg it be super free to play friendly and you consistently get free pack card over time even in the beginning you do not feel like you be completely outmatched just because someone have rarer card in their deck than you you can play budget deck see and still win with a good strategy it be a bit close to magic the gathering mtg than simple card game like hearthstone and shadowverse in that you still draw power card rather than gain power evenly each turn but there be a lot more mechanic compare to mtg that reduce how often you draw too little or too much power it be also more like mtg in that it be more complex than the other digital ccg option out there one major benefit over mtg be that this be strictly a digital game so you have fun mechanic that would be very hard to pull off for mtg since that still have to cater to a physical card game for example stat on kill unit remain even if the card return from the void just recently dec 2018 a new set of card have come out that have really add to the deck building option it feel like the popular deck be always change and you have many different option with the type of game you can play and that one type of deck be not always the winner you be definitely reward for playing against other player but especially in the beginning and after a new set be release play against the ai be fun and give you a lot of card the reason be that when you draft card unlike other game they be permanently add to your deck how cool be that definitely try it it be free to play and you never feel pressured to put money into the game you can play on ios android steam xbox and they be always keep in sync and all reward be available on all platform achievement sync too except xbox pvp play be cross platform note that you get a free preconstructe deck by use a referral code to sign up i do not want to post my code but feel free to message me for it if you find my review helpful i would appreciate it that say do not feel bad if you do not get the deck you can get all those card fairly quickly even if you do not use a referral link the game do make you play the first six or so game of the tutorial but after that you can skip the tutorial from the setting menu if you do not want to complete it also check out reddit for a really cool community and more information there be also a couple link there to free promotion that get a free campaign you can also get other campaign by spend in game currency that you gain just by play as i say you do not have to pay anything there be some extra visual item that you can purchase deck back etc but they have absolutely no bearing on gameplay and they be strictly there if you want to change some cosmetic feature and or support the developer even without spend money new cosmetic option be available to you fairly often again the current player base would love to see the community grow many player be very pro and competitive but be great to learn from and sup friendly i be more casual but really enjoy the strategy of this type of card game i also feel the art style be really cool without be too weird gross or overtly sexualize i would not feel weird about other see me play this game unlike a couple other ccgs out there,pos
early access reviewsome aspect of the game be appeal include the large variety of vehicle however when it boil down to it the blatantly pay2win business model alienate anyone who do not whip out their credit card and floaty gunplay make this game only worth a bit of fun with friend rather than something you would pour a lot of free time into,neg
it have interesting moment and do indeed start turn creepy every time but it get really annoying and it make you go through the same room over and over which get quite boring it will maybe be good to scare your little brother or something like that,neg
this go from be one of my favourite game and good flight simulator to a total mess the dev be roll out update that just seem to make the game progressively more buggy and unstable mp server be die because of this just now the game end up use all the ram in my 16 gb system due to a memory leak it also take year for every little plane module to be add in the game i be guess the studio do the devving must be do it as a part time or hobby thing,neg
this be suppose to be a review for counter strike global offensive dedicated server apparently that be not a game i should have know not only can i not play the dedicated server like it be a game i can not review it like one either let me save you some time do not try to play counter strike global offensive dedicated server it be not a game if you want a comparable non game open the command prompt that will save you so much download it be like you have to download all the counter strike global offensive content but only get to access it through command prompt why sure sure other people can play the game on your computer because you be run a server but all i get be word in a black box who need that certainly not me get shoot repeatedly in team fortress 2 be much well i would encourage you to play team fortress 2 over something like command prompt simulator for counter strike global offensive,pos
the good modern and some old model combat flight simulator out there atm i love how they combine them all in a way that have not be do successfully before cater to the more serious simulation enthousiast they be expand their line up of available aircraft with third party development that can certainly compete with their own level of polish and detail,pos
early access reviewi think this game be pretty good but the one problem i have be that there s no australian server so i get lag use any of the other server since i be in nz yeah hope there will be one soon enough i do recommend this game tho its very fun,pos

one of the most amazing building game out there the amount of thing in the game be amazing there be huge world without out pro you can just hold a little bit less and not glide around that be no big deal i play with many people who do not have pro and they do not feel its a need i do not either i however do purchase it to support the dev there be hundred of thing available to build you do not need to buy anything to make this game super enjoyable this be an awesome game i would recommend it to all of my friend there be no infinite loading screen bug and if there be contact a dev they will actualyl help have 0 2 hour on record show that you do not even try this be the most enjoyable creation game i have ever play people be willing to help all the time i rate this game 10 10 of course like all game it have some slight issue but lol they do not outweigh the gameplay or the fun and creativity that people have pour into it,pos
very good execution of the turn base game mechanic it may be free and boost player with microtransaction but still even as a free game it have a lot to offer but need to be a bit patient i highly recommend this for anyone that want to have a relax small game on their pc,pos

edit i do not leave because i could not deal with the bias ija main in the top 30 of the playerbase i leave because of gaijins shenanigan with the exploit coverup and the consequent banning of my clan leader after he post about it on live ussr the game seriously for example the our stuff be the good around despite suck compare to everyone elses mentality common in communist country such as the ussr be very much in play here as russian equipment be by far the most unrealistically powerful in the game ussr style censorship be also in play with one particular example come to mind where the ceo of the freaking company ask player to remove all trace online of a game breaking exploit which be still in the game i would not be surprised if they try to get this review remove ussr style respect for the player be also in play with the entire game run on the simple basis of you do not like thing good let us make it even worse despite all of this they actually have the audacity to ask the playerbase to vote for them in the steam award i do nominate them for the russian bias award i recommend do the same i play this game for far too long before realize all of this if there be one good thing about it be the fact that it be well than world of warplane but let us get real here what be not,neg
early access reviewi have see this game feature a lot and never bother to try it it never really look to great i get a free beta key and try it out i love this game it be 1 of the funn game i have play in a long time i purchase the founder pack to support the game because i feel that i cheat them out of that well deserved purchase i love you brawlhalla 3,pos
early access reviewas of now the game be early access so thing may change but as for now this game be pretty great it be an interesting take on the moba genre that i think have a pretty nice payoff the ship all have their own fun ability that make the game all drastically different from one another as for graphic even on low setting this game look amazing and the ship themselves all have rad design the texture could use a little work at the moment especially on the asteroid in the different area i can not wait to see what more come of this game good on ya edge case,pos
i really like the graphic to this game it be fun to play for about 5 min until the game freeze try a few thing to see if i could fix the problem and no luck so i have end up delete the game from my computer disappoint really i be hope to continue play hope the issue get fix p s this game ed up my computer so badly nothing load properly anymore my computer take even long to start up do not get this game save yourself the bill of have to send it in to get fix,neg

oh where to begin with neverwinter now this review will most likely bring on a lot of controversy but who care neverwinter be a f2p mmorpg publish by perfect world now a lot of perfect world game tend to be pay to win to the extreme neverwinter be not pay to win unlike the other the only thing to win in neverwinter be pvp but pvp be not a big part of the game itself and there be no item you can pay real life money for to help you in pvp of course neverwinter have an in game currency call zen that you can pay real life money for but the only thing zen let you buy be fashion item dye companion mount and a few other item not essential to own now of course like many other mmo in game currency like zen can allow you to pay for convenience such as buy a fast mount mount serve no purpose other than get you where you need to go at a quick rate rather than walk be that pay to win no it be not what be you win a race to the quest area people do not like spend real life money on mmos but the game be free be it not so complain be silly anways the main currency in neverwinter that require no real life money to earn be call astral diamond you do not want to spend real life money on neverwinter have no fear with ad you can purchase companion mount and plenty of other neat item though for a price 25k ad be the max you can earn with your daily quest however every dungeon you play you have a 90 chance of obtain a purple item purple item sell for a fair amount of ad on the auction house whether its to 20k or 1mill so really earn ad be not an issue me i have play neverwinter since beta two year ago and have never spend a dime to get the cool item i desire i just play the game and earn ad which as state before be not as hard as people say it to be the point of play a game be earn what you want and work towards your goal but many be lazy and do not want to work for what they want i also forget to mention if you really want something off the zen market but have no desire to pay real life money for exclusive item on it do you know you can trade ad for zen be not that nice that neverwinter allow you to do that they give you every option in the game to get what you want without pay a single cent i do not know about you but that s very nice especially for a free game in game event also happen often and every event give you a chance to get a very unique item of some kind whether its so a very cool fast mount a strong companion or just a silly item like a portable throne now let talk about the worker behind neverwinter that be really a great group of people they constantly work hard daily to keep neverwinter run add new content very often and keep it bug free the employee be also very easy to get ahold of and they be the most helpful bunch that will assist you with anything you need its very important for a game to have that they also play neverwinter and they even take the time to play with player in game and occasionally help out people in need how cool be that they also stream on twitch often and give away in game item and even phsyical item like t shirt so overall neverwinter be one of the best free to play mmo out right now there be a reason i have be play this game since beta it even have an epic story line unlike many other mmos that do not like everybody else i skip dialog i do not care i just want to play with neverwinter everything about it whether its to the lore or story line be so very intriguing and make you want to really understand what s go on and pay attention neverwinter be also very visually stunning and the amount of work and detail put into this game be really quite amazing do not believe me check out my screenshot and look at my neverwinter one you will also see that i have an epic mount easily obtain by earn ad like mmorpg want a game full of endless content you can spend countless hour on do you like dungeon and dragon then take the time to play neverwinter atm,pos
early access reviewnot worth the grind against tryhard pro with clown deck design to purposely annoy and frustrate you just to earn enough to unlock the solo quest the mechanic never feel fair whether you be win or lose,neg
early access reviewthis game make me want to run away from my computer and never turn it back on again it be surprising how scary a game that look like it be make in 1995 can be you end up sprint through every room know that if you stay still for just a moment you be likely to get rip to peice and some horrible annimation will come up on the screen that would be enough to give your child future mental issue and kill off your grandma so you run and you run even from the sound come from everywhere and you run straight into a guy that want to put a pin through your eyeball and turn you into one of his puppet my advice would be assume everybody and everything want to kill you do not explore just run as fast as you can into a cardboard cut out of a pumpkin that will jump out at you and that in any other situation would not be all that bad but here it make you fall backwards off your chair oh and do not look behind you all you will see be a guy with a machete try to hack you up or a ghost girl that want to eat your brain or some green guy that for some reason seem reallyoff with you as if you have not get enough on your plate already they all move in a creepy way and they be pretty scary when you catch a glimpse of them great game 10 10 would love to see update graphic in the future though,pos
early access reviewpretty awesome game but extremely pay to win i if you spend enough u can unlock everything in the game allmost instently where as if u take the long way around it will take you about 5000 hour of game time,neg
to the idiot who be post negative review i just have this to say why be you surprised that a game call sakura clicker be nothing but a clicker wtf do you expect and no the nudity tag be not misleading because the dev make a patch to add it in since steam will not let them have it right outta the gate anyway there be nothing wrong with the game and it be free so it be not like you pay for it if you do then i would have a problem,pos

although this be a simplify version of the wots game it be a much friendly fast game without the troll common to wots i find it to be a game to relax in and just enjoy yes to advance in the game in take a bit of money and premium time give you more reward just as in wots but the cost be much less you can play for free at a basic level but i find it take a small amount of cash to truly have fun but after all nothing be free,pos

early access reviewso i have play my fair share of this and find out alot about it and to make a long list short pro can be fun fast fps gameoh man the con find alot of the map be unbalanced or really one side the skill level matchup be uneven and can again be one sided alot of one shoot one kill position around map that almost lead to spawn which make spawncamping often alot of spawncamping also you can not gain tracktion if you begin to loose in tdm which often lead to defeat basically it be an fast simple game with quite alot of thing to equip but have to earn credit and buy grenade for an extended period of time 1 3 7 etc day do not make sense besides keep the player from hog all the credit the map can be either symmetrical mirrored or onesided which can be good or bad and with one sided i mean one of the team have well holding and or ambush position well line of sight or just more cover the weapon be quite nice i be very fond of the start weapon until switch weapon from knife while run to gun at contact be out of sync with my reaction time which mean i get kill even though i be fire but the animation be too slow to actually fire anything at all may just be me that have not get the hang of it but annoying as hell i find the overall skill level strange in one map you compete against equal and have a good fight then the next map you can get demolish or demolish them it be often the map you play that determine the outcome can not really recommend this before they have tweak some of the content and i will not come back before that either,neg
early access reviewthis game be very fast paced and simple in a good way the sound and the graphic be nice the gameplay be quick and satisfying and honestly it be nice to play team death match again with all the battle royal and overwatch style objective shooter trend it be nice to turn off your mind for a bit and just shoot people it really bring me back to the reason i start play shooting game in the first place just fast pace gameplay where all you need to worry about be kill and be kill i like that you can get all the gun without spend any money though if you want to look cool with a skin you may have to shell out quite a bit the drop rate in the loot crate be god awful at the moment i be hope the chance get well to give us at least a little hope also not that important but it would be cool to be able to make a few change to your character model other than straight replace it with acompletely different character to get a little variety and personalization go it be nice to have the choice to mute team all chat for when you really just do not want to hear any of it it give player the change to say what they want in chat without bother people who do not want to be involve in trash talk offend since they can just perma mute chat overall i have def enjoy the game so far and will continue play long term most likely maybe one day i will even be good at the game,pos
just put it this way the game be f2p its an rpg lot of folk play you can still quest and do dungeon even without the super rare legendary i have be play a lot long than you gear could the game use some more work yeah but the way it be the game be still decent imo they should focus on improve the game overall rather than keep release new module or at least focus on game mechanic etc for next two major update then go back to release module i may not have a lot of time invest in the game to voice my opinion about the game overall but i like rpg and while i be not a hardcore player i be sure somebody would value this opinion review,pos
early access reviewfinally eternal card game be the game wizard of the coast should have create 10 year ago have wizard create an accessible attractive and intuitive occg base on mtg they would be the dominant player in the market go on a decade now however their short sightedness and unwillingness to experiment with their ip mean we have to wait for eternal to scratch our magic itch hex while a beautiful and intricate game lack the accessible and intuitive aspect that hearthstone and eternal meet the gameplay in eternal be rock solid take core ccg mechanic and tie them to color similar to mtg currently the color be not as stratify as mtg which allow for more versatile single color deck while offer expand option for multi colored deck eternal after my 10 hour of play or so so take it with a grain of salt seem less focused on define the metagame itself unlike hearthstone and to some extent mtg where the meta minus minor tweaking be establish within day of a new set come out largely by the developer this be for 2 reason the core mechanic introduce in hearthstone expansion be usually the most efficient jade single copy bomb like reno and kazakus etc and the limited card pool simply do not allow much experimentation although i be just start with eternal it appear that there be a decent range of creature removal large creature and the like in each color along with some strong but not force theme like echo and void play while eternal have a mana mechanic it be automate this mean the game set your mana curve for you limit your optimal mana ratio however i assume they do it to remove complexity from deck building which be a good thing when try to bring in more casual player the game offer a plethora of mana fixing card as well in both colorless and colored card to allow well control of your mana flow so far i have only be mana hose on a couple of occasion in most game mana have tend to be plentiful often to the point of excess as my early game tend to go long while i build my collection and create more efficient deck eternal thankfully do away with the tiny card pack of hearthstone and hex and have 12 card per pack very close to the 14 minus the land in a mtg pack at 1 pack not count the ability to draft guantlet or forge for free card dust the pack size value ratio be exceptional compare to hex mtgo and hearthstone currently the game mode available be gauntlet forge rank and draft as someone who like to play mostly solo as i build a collection the game mode be very close to perfect gauntlet be a free pve construct tournament mode and can be use to grind gold and some usually common or uncommon card with a perfect 7 win record earn a card pack as well the ai mode seem well design to offer player good reward as the player base could probably not accommodate pvp in each forge be eternal arena a seal deck format where you build a deck from random set of 3 card again the game assign your mana it appear though i have only play once but do get a perfect 7 win that once you have choose 2 color of card all remain pick be of those 2 color this be a very nice feature and prevent someone from get pretty far off track into 5 color though i be certain there be some who would actually like that arena cost 2500 gold to enter the 7 win run earn me 3500 gold a couple of card and 4 card pack so a little more than 3 1 value you be allow 2 loss before your run end as you be play an ai it seem this mode offer a pretty fair chance to hit 7 win if you be good at seal in ccgs if the deck the ai be play do not get more challenging as you rank up in forge it should be pretty easy to go infinite i have only play a few game of rank just enough to get a win for a quest as i doubt i be prepared to face construct deck quite yet the mode work fine and even with only about 2k player online at any time the matchmaking only take a little longer than hearthstone the casual mode be currently offline i be guess until a large player base mean it will not cause extended queue time i have not draft yet but i will update my review when i do overall eternal be a great entry to the crowded online ccg market and outside of hearthstone may be the one to succeed with player who want something a little deep than blizzard game the nitpick i have with the game be minor i think the art look a little small on the play table and i be on a 27 monitor though it be fine when zoom in as a once upon a time competitive magic player that quit mainly due to mana randomness i prefer a hearthstone style consistently build mana pool however it be not a game breaker and i have not notice it be as much of a problem as i have in my ptq qualifier day if you be a magic player that want deep mechanic but still slick up hearthstone style experience eternal be your game,pos
this be a very good game once you get past the tutorial and for a game port from the phone it really be not that bad its free and it be yu gi oh what else do i really have to say like its constanly update and there be ton off special event also if you be cry about the damn volume during the download turn it down from volume manager turn your headset down un plug your pc during download or important window update stop cry about the small thing and life and grow up like seriously,pos

have a good chance but it be be a year since i have play it and when i instal it recently it be still not optimize with huge frame issue from go really high fps to low fps too frequently and when you jump from a moderate hight your character glitch into the ground but you do not get stuck or anything just look ugly overall to many frame issue that be still present a year later make the game feel less progress then it should if the optimization issue go away then i would deffinanlty give it a good review i will check back in a few month,neg
i be not an expert on this type of game but can say that tiny tower nimblebit circa 2014 be way less infuriating and way more engaging i have play both on mobile and on pc the game be much more suited for mobile but it be too difficult on a small screen attacker at the door then a stray touch easy to do on bezel less and curved screen phone would zoom way in on a random spot on the screen zoom back out try to grab a 3 mm tall guy on the screen but can not do that until the resource be collect collect the resource misclick try to tap hold the guy 3 more time zoom back in grab him slowly drag him to the vault door at max zoom have the screen not register your finger for a moment while drag him scroll back down to that room grab him again and finally stick him in the front room now check his weapon try sort the weapon list but still have to go through a list of 15 weak weapon to find your one rare legendary that you stick on someone after a fail rush now you have 1 defender of course the fight halfway over now people be dead now watch slow mostly passive combat with quirky seemingly redundant control be we have fun yet terrible experience bore as hell and now you have waste 8 hour of travel time because you want to save a few medpack for incident emergency later once you finally get a little resource security and medpack capacity even if you do not have a radio station watch deathclaw rip through your entire vault while you try to stop them with hunt rifle equivalent rage quit come back a bit later get hit with deathclaw again before you have even be able to heal up from the first attack live in constant fear of the next deathclaw attack or even the next scorpion attack now that you be out of medpack and rush them be too risky the next attack could wipe out your entire vault extremely mismatched risk for a game that be mostly plan and hand off wait the good way to avoid lose your vault be to keep the game close as much as possible lol next day your phone screen turn on once in the middle of the night wake up to a pile of body and no way to roll back to the last save give up on that vault there be so much wait that you will probably have the same result after fall asleep during all the excitement try switch to pc to deal with pain of move defender around to incident but it be almost as much a pita as on android also the tap zooming be ridiculous i just want to turn it off completely and only have it respond to mousewheel zoom positive appropriately price base game the humor be legitimately great especially for fallout fan cloud save do not work between steam and android but you can manually transfer unaltered savefile between the two platform you can also back up these file but it be kind of a pain possible to edit your save if you can resist do thing that will ruin progression critical hit meter be cool epically soporific excitement wait 7 minute for your medpack to finish 3 hour for your baby dweller 3 more for them to grow up 7 hour for your special point training 6 hour for your team to get to a diner to fight a radroach 8 hour for your scavenger to return and 4 day for your weapon all intermix with deathclaw panic negative freemium or not i expect a lot more from a major studio in term of design the basic interface interaction have none of the refinement friendliness of your average knock off clash game and there be a lot to be desire in term of quality of life also deathclaw be ridiculously unbalanced at early level start on android but load of problem constant crash have to reload game twice each time after it have be fully shut down quest would take like 10 second of loading screen usually follow by a crash this be on probably the most popular flagship phone run oreo coudnt get it past the savefile screen on memu either hey bethesda maybe hire some mobile dev on day 1 my phone actually warn me the app have crash 10 time and that it be slow down my phone if you could turn deathclaw off in normal mode or if the control do not so often get in the way of react quickly eg preset loadout or pause game while use equipment garrison interface i would be way more excited about this game edit oh yeah and the rush sage be absolute garbage 40 90 this mechanic be not clever or challenging it be just dumb give their obnoxious interface the number should 1 accurately reflect the base rate obviously and 2 visibly change base on the luck modifier present so you do not have to tediously check every dweller setup whoever design this mechanic should see if mcds be hire,neg

i actually really like this game i play it with friend and we play it a lot for all the people out there that complain about the game be too expensive the f2p side of the game be basically a demo to see if you enjoy the game if you like it you can buy the 15 membership which give you all the basic essential need to play the game the game need money to survive and become more developed it be not like the game could be successful if no one buy anything and everything be free i think the 15 be well worth consider you can hunt everything and they give you everything you need to hunt everything but that s just my opinion well developed and update game 9 5 10 scary as when charge by a bear,pos

i pretty much like everything about this game great combat good dungeon have not try raid yet or pvp so can not comment on that it be also optimize really well for pc be nice if the ps4 version be optimize well it frame lag quite a bit at time wish there be a few more spell to use though but other than that i enjoy my time in neverwinter it be worth try out the only thing that i do not like be the fact that you have to spend money on character slot but you can spend 5 and get all of them but one so in a way it be not really that bad still do not care for that though it be a great free to play game if you be look for something similar to wow,pos
i have play this game since beta in the orange box all those year ago i love it because i could just pick up and play until the meet your match update that be do not get me wrong i like the idea of a competitive game mode but why do they have to remove the old quick play i have give the game a few hour since the update and here be my thought matchmaking take waaay too longclass balance be anything butcommunity server be to the old quick playthere be some good thing in this though the party feature for one i usually play with friend and that be a feature i want for a long time and i guess the ui update be nice 09 07 2016 since the patch last night i think i would update this review the casual mode have be change to bring it closer to what the name suggest you can now select as little as 1 game type and you no longer get penalise for leave a game early this bring it back to what it should have be matchmake still take meny meny long minute though so we will just have to wait for that bug to be sort and spy seem to be able to backstab from any angle,neg

okay for starter this be not yu gi oh and with that be say i both enjoy and loathe this game also the pay wall do not personally bother me too much because i grow up playing card game what you need to know 1 twenty card deck rule the game and these deck be usually load with the good trap and spell money can buy so if you play this game pick a card box with the good spell and trap card in it and keep use your free gem on those box until you have two or three copy of say card pro tip reset set the box after you pull the card you be go after 2 you will see the top meta deck so many time that you will beg to see some originality lol you will never escape this even in unranked 3 farm mai for amazonian card because amazonian deck can be mostly build from card drop amazonian deck be pretty powerful even in rank you can also get solid plant water card from the card trader google this for more info 4 the game have alot of connection issue which can end a match prematurelyimao 1 honestly play this game at your own risk because it be design to make you spend cash 2 deck size should be increase to 30 minimum3 card box need few trash monster better spell and trap card to balance out the f2p ultra rare card discrepancy 4 i could list more serious problem cause by konami or just gameplay in general but these be the thing i hate the most about the game in closing if i see one more fully load blue eye deck i be go to vomit,neg

if you be a fan of minecraft and all the feature that make it good this game will disappoint you the major issue with this game be 1 the developer have an ego they do not actually listen to the community despite the lie that pr spout and be patronizing to the community while claim to listen to them 2 there be no option for texture pack mod single player or creative mode the most demand feature by the community see 1 none of the feature would be hard to do and keep it free either 3 it be very sub par on the survival side of thing it be generally too easy to get to top tier equipment and there be not very much equipment to get in the first place farming be slow and awful this be where modding would help but playful treat the topic like it be heresy 4 the exploration be very underwhelming after about an hour it become a recur theme of oh i have see this before there be no village no dungeon no monument no random building limit biome variety limit mob variety etc 5 it be a bit expensive oh but it be free to play accord to pr well technically yes but like it or not the game have achieve pay to win status sure none of the core feature be lock behind a pay wall but literally all additional texture and the cool equipment absolutely be lock behind a pay wall heck there have be entire update that have most of the content lock behind a pay wall want the good stuff expect to pay 70 for this game 6 it deserve to be repeat the dev do not care about the community when they claim to listen what they mean be that they cherry pick the request they like and implement them then give themselves glorious fanfare on blog and social medium to the tune of look how much we listen,neg

it be fun competitive and a constantly evolve game not at all pay to win though there be some in app purchase available 1 issue be the toxic playerbase but there be setting available to minimize that if you so desire love the game will not stop play it until they shut the server down,pos
in my opinion it be the good action rpg that be on the market right now it have a grim setting and a story that be mostly tell through environmental bit of lore but most importantly it have a depth of gameplay that no other arpg come even close to it be the good spiritual successor to diablo ii to date the first time you open the passive skill tree you be likely to be overwhelm there be a web with hundred of choice do not worry eventually it will make sense you can obtain respect point via quest and item drop so you can not mess anything up permanently anyway your active skill be acquire by put skill gem into socket on your gear the gem have one of three colour red blue green that match with the colour of the socket on your gear socket can be link allow you to attach support gem to your active skill gem this can do thing such as split your burn arrow into 4 projectile or turn your glacial hammer attack into an aoe attack that hurt monster all around you later in the game you can even find support gem that can trigger active skill gem automatically once you take enough damage or get stun every three month the dev launch a major patch with a new challenge league which add new skill new game mechanic and challenge which offer new loot reward and cosmetic the free to play model be truly free to play you can play all the content in the game without pay a dime the only way the game developer make money be by offer microtransaction in their store for cosmetic upgrade that do not affect gameplay want your mismatched set of gear to have a unified look maybe shop for a set of cosmetic armor look want your fireball to look like a dragon there be a microtransaction for that want a lizard with a bell on it be back to follow you around like a puppy there be a microtransaction for that i have put hundred of hour into the game use their native client because i start play before the game be on steam and find buy the microtransaction to be a good way to support the developer so they can continue to add more and more and more and more content to the game while also make my character look awesome via the cosmetic microtransaction there be a few non cosmetic microtransaction available to upgrade your account with more character slot i believe the default be 12 so that be enough to create at least one character of each of the 7 class and to get more share stash tab to hoard all the item you find and share them between your character the default you get be 4 which people be start to argue be enough when the game launch in 2013 but be a little cramped for all the content we have now in 2016 there be also premium stash tab that allow you to rename the stash tab and give their label colour the game be free so why be you read this review instead of play the game,pos
this be the absolute good ww2 tank game you can get if your a 5 year old want to point click die and retry the grind be horrible you will get to tier 4 5 then stay there horrible gameplay with a braindead playerbase with no sense of tactical knowhow or teamwork,neg
the simplicity of the game be what make the game so fun and easy to learn but insanely difficult to master and i can not tell you how much fun it be to learn how to play each class when i first brance out into other class for real be when mvm come out and i be practically force to play other role to support the team and at that point it be when i realize i have love for more than just the sniper and spy and i could learn to enjoy all the other class too there be always something of each class everybody can enjoy maybe not everybody but why do i hate this game even though i give it a good rating the fact that this game be slowly die and to me it seem like valve seem to care less and less about tf2 and just scrap up community map for new update and shove in skin and try to squeeze as much money as they can the last update be not terrible it have me play for a couple more hour but it be not enough to bring me back to the good old day not only that but the price of trade only increase and never seem to stabalize and constantly fluctuate which make trading dead unless you have unsual on you but why bother leave a good review you may ask because the only thing that tf2 seem to do right compare to every other game out there in the market be that no matter how much i hate this game get bored of it and realize how it be die every month or so i will eventually come back to it anyway the game be amazing and i can not deny it even if i want to tl dr i ing hate this game but you should definetly still play it because i love it 12 10 would definetly get stab by a spy again,pos

early access reviewive not play much of this game so its fair to say that i have not be able to experience all the feature however i already see the aspect of the game which need emphasise and the problem of this game the game be early access so it have the odd bug a multicoloured polygon game spring to mind but this be not something to get angry about in game before its official release the team work on this be small but the game be often update as be the outline plan and community engagement be fantastic from artix entertainment it be the nostalgia of my playing aq world almost ten year ago that draw me to this game it have some of the same charm and humour but not to the same extent at time the game can feel like its try to hard to be what its predecessor be the big question when it come to this game be whether try to make the game accessible for mobile gamer have limit its appeal and enjoyment for pc gamer the answer in short be yes the camera feel clunky and the game very much feel like its design for regular visit and clicking which could be do on a small screen the classic trope of mmos grind quest be definitely frequent toward the point of tediousness some redesign be definitely need in term of quest placement and objective my main suggestion in this field would be to drop about half the quest often quest be very small possibly to make it them completable on the move and so double the reward for the remainder with a slight increase in difficulty i think its more important to feel a sense of accomplish in term of achievement rather than in gear the game do not feel like a life experience in the same way as other some mmo and rpgs include aq world do but more like the repetitive formula of a grind for gear rather than a quest to accomplish a task thus the problem be that the game feel far too much like a classic mmo and not enough like the game it could be perhaps essentially what be need be a slightly alter 3d version of the of artixs more successful 2d game another problem be the craft system when you collect enough raw material npc craft shop can make this into gear for a price this be quite basic and nothing i really have a problem with the issue lie in the need to wait a set about of time a minute an hour a day etc in order to collect your new gear it slow the game and when you collect the item it can sometimes be that it no longer feel worth the time as you have level up and find new equipment to use the question that i think it come down to ask yourself be whether it be well to invest your time in a game mid development or a game in what be essentially the dlc phase should you play adventurequest 3d or aq world for me get back into the latter be very daunting with so much content one of the reason i often avoid mmo be because i feel so out of my depth when compare to player who have be around for so much longer the 3d game be lack but it have fantastic potential and will hopefully grow into the game it could be its worth take the time to try this game before dismiss it especially for people who play artix game some year ago,pos
early access reviewi have play a lot of world war 2 game but i have yet to play one that make my effort as a lowly foot soldier feel like piddly i try this game in early early close alpha year ago and i have try it again to see what have change i suppose for the ardent supporter if they find something redeemable here they may enjoy it i instead be greet by cheesy mechanic reward one hit kill with bolt action ineffectual rifle and an overall feeling of futility as i try to do anything except die if you want to waste your bandwidth and try by all mean i welcome you to it this however be not a game i would recommend to friend the sheer progression for weapon be one of the absolute bad i have see in a free2play game i have see the t warframe pull and this pull far far ahead do you value that shiny ppsh all the russians kill them nazzys with do you want to pay real money for a virtual gun in an otherwiseexperience if the answer to the latter be no do yourself a favor and just install red orchestra 2 and enjoy a game that encapsulate the horror and adrenaline the second world war exemplify,neg

this be by far the good idle game i have ever play i be a pretty big idle game fan so i be always look for new one to play but this one really take the cake it be extremely in depth easy to learn and go on for sooo long i have always want an idle game that keep go for a long time that be not repetetive and this be it clicker hero probably be long but it be basically just the same thing over and over this game constantly have new thing to unlock new goal to achieve and new strategy to learn i have mostly be play on mobile but my save have 72 day on it which include offline and online but i have be play a lot over those 72 day and accord to the wiki i be not even halfway to the end the game can be really complex at time and sometimes it may be easy to look up how to do something rather than experiment but you never really have to i look up a lot of thing during my playthough of the game and follow the wiki pretty closely but if you be more about discover the right way to do thing yourself then that also work but may take a bit longer overall this be an amazing idle game and i be so glad i decide to pick it up i really like that there be a mobile version too as i can transfer my save between platform if i need to with so much content and the fact that it be still be update i can picture myself spend a lot of time with this game this be the idle game i have always want,pos

i have decide to make a more serious reveiw for this game if you have a few spare minuite i suggest you read this review let us take a time machine back to the end of 2013 i have just get into the pc gaming scene and decide to take a look at the most popular free to play game sure enough team fortress 2 stick out like a sore thumb and i immediately instal my first match be completely outstanding and i will always remember the rush i feel as me and my team mate push the objective on dustbowl for the first time foolishly i think i would start with playing sniper but it be then i realise that each class be completely unique in their own way they have both upside and downside for example you have soldier who be capible of output massive ammount of splash damage with his rocket launcher at the cost of only be able to have four rocket load at a time and engineer who be able to lock down entire control point with his sentry gun only to have them easilly destroy by spy or explosive do not even get me start on the amazing unwritten ability that the class have for example you have demo soldier who be able to utilize their sticky and rocket launcher to jump across the many vast and expansive map you also have scout who be able to use weapon combo like the atomizer and the force o nature to practically fly across control point and avoid danger below in all team fortoress 2 will forever remain one of my favorite game of all time and have earn a place in the pc gaming hall of fame,pos
i play this game because friend ask me to with 20 hour under my belt i can safely say i still have absolutely no idea what the i be do this game be not beginner friendly if this be your first moba you need to start with something light because dota 2 will completely overwhelm you there be very little balance player will treat you like trash because most of the community be build of dota 1 player who already know the in and out and you will struggle to find the right guide that will show you what you be do wrong if you be play with friend who be much well than you you will only be hold them back if you be play with friend who be much bad than you you will grow tired of play with them dota 2 be like a fine wine a lot of fun for somebody experience taste like pee for a newbie,neg
with my hour in this i beleive i can give a credible opinion on this game i reccomend this game if you be plan on play this game every once in a while as with this game terrible grind system you will not be get too far down the tech tree i play both tank and aircraft and it seem the balance go down the drain the further you get and the match get less and less enjoyable plane be great although the russian aircraft get really annoying as a bit less than half the player i it seem bring them into battle i love american tech and vehicle so i primary them and then the germans for both game mode and it from what i experience everything in the american lineup be not as good as the other it be put up against this be mostly direct for ground force a massive chunk of the early tree be make up of the m4 sherman type tank and its great at first but when you use the same gun for 5 tank down the same tree face tiger and panther and break t34 it become incredibly stale now that i have 2 6 0 tank go into battle be now a complete waste of time i usually when i play ground force get 4 5 kill per match but now i be get less than 300 rp and barely a single assist my advice be to either 1 pay for premium golden eagle to boost your way out of the terrible 5 7 mess of a matchmaking or quit and play another of the faction until you hit that point it after hundred of hour of work be incredibly dissappointing,neg
okay unlike most of the people who review this game i actually take the time to play it for awhile i love the concept of this game have a dragon to train a soul bond and you can only have 1 but it contradict itself it say you can only have 1 dragon that you will bond with but if you pay for gem you can have several dragon you can not earn the dragon that cost gem unless you a buy gem or b buy a membership i do not really feel like this game be pay2win as much as i feel that it be pay2havefuncosmetic the flying on the dragon be actually quite fun i be surprised to be have fun just go through the obstacle course it be not a very explaining game the tutorial be like yeah do this and they expect you to know how to do everything at one point in this game i get very frustrated because it glitche and it say to feed my dragon a fish your thinking ok how hard can this be well when your dragon be nowhere to be see i have no idea how to feed him your dragon will be a derpmonster and walk off several time and wouldent you expect to fly your own dragon no you will be fly a dragon call nightmare or something supposedly you can not fly on your dragon till it be out of baby mode and then it do not explain how to get your dragon out of baby mode i like this game but at the same time i hate it pro great conceptgood storylinekid friendlycon expect your kid to get frustratedterrible graphicsterrible lagterrible glitchinessterrible explanationsand thank you this be my review on sotif someone ever do come out with a game like this but can turn it into a working concept it will be a great game,neg

early access reviewwas the awesomenes construction simulator 2014 that be what this game be note that i be a tier 9 and have just recently play this game to update my review i have build m 35 mako from mass effect 1 m 44 hammerhead from mass effect 2 ut 47a kodiak from mass effect 3 terran diamondback from starcraft 2 terran aratmatmatmatme mercenary siege tank yes the siege breaker from wing of liberty but none of that matter when the base physics of the game have be modify from what be establish the weapon continuously nerfe until be 6 foot under reward be lower with improvment to the system and a plethora of other problem back in early 2014 i strongly i repeat strongly support this game strongly i emphasize this say it with me strongly support this game but with every step forward freejam have show they intend to take two step back every time clone war so let us first start off with the removal of all the nice cool gadget that be originally available right at the start this include the hoverblade plasma launcher railgun and thruster from level 1 upward of level 3 yes this happen freejam do not change this until 7 month later when people stop cry and moan for it to come back double edge butt atmatmatmatmery now prior to this they also make some modification to the reward system add a repair function to the game which put a drain on casual player tier 6 and up back then what be the kick in the ball here a 25 decrease in reward yes both rp and tp robopoint and techpoints hero zero next up be the hero system which allow you to get the full rp and tp from a match you die in if your team win but wait at the cost of the entire reward system get another 25 decrease at this point manage to make enough money to get new part be an uphill battle and at a 50 reward decrease that have remain permanent to this day it be be a massive pain in theatmatmatmatmatm turn up for hate now next up they remove repair cost yet yet again another freaking reward quantity decrease you get the pattern yet do not worry i will explain it in a second at this point it get rediculous but oh no there be even more from intense to indense this game be always a one life team death match game the respawne and overclocke update have kill everything that make it original and turn it into a confused moba wannabe even bad be that they have now set the original mode now name classic so far on the back burner it can take from 5 minute to 3 hour just to get on a match gradually decrease the time need to even get into one with each tier you go up but heres the final blow to the old mode a 80 decrease at this point to the profit you make from it classic be now as worthwhile as dump youratmatmatmatmatmin a toilet or on a development team think that be the bad part oh no i be not even finish what be wrong with my atmatmatmatming keyboard the control with any movement design other than tank tread will feel so obliterate you will literally ask yeah that be right the subtitle of this paragraph as of the r o update wheel be incredibly sluggish rocket provide minimal momentum hoverblade be highly unstable if you lose even one aerofoil be a disaster to use walker leg be bloody hell to even keep still on a ceiling or a steep hill if you want to stay in place and believe me it be go to walk down to the surface on you while you shoot and lastly the rotor blade design be sluggish as well thisatmatmatmatmatmatmgenuinely bring my p ss to a plasmatic boil the challenge should not be in handicap the atmatmatmatme player give us ur monie why all the reward debuff because they want money they want to force the playerbase to purchase premium currency so that they can accelerate their growth to a level they can remotely tolerate this game never do have a fair free to play model but it be now skewed beyond any conceivable belief and also no it be not even classify as pay to win it be pay to atmatmatmatme progress give us ur monie 2 1 the introduction of easy anti cheat or eac instead of use steam vac system which work very well and still mostly do make no sense either they decide to use a third party system that not only people have always second guess but never trust and never be comfortable with you see where this be go yeah they drive off a number of their player base state if you can not get into robocraft to play because of eac that be a small price to pay for the issue of hacker try to ruin our game the only people who try to help fix this be eac themselves as i recall and even then only under the pressure of the robocraft community which have already start leave give us ur ferkign muneez 11 eleven why do eac have to fix it because freejam be too dumbfounded watch the star shine out of their fat frigging assh0les to do it themselves aside from the matter of the development companys profoundly horrendous inexperience in stop hacker in the first place but it do not even end there they will not respond to crticism kindly light or dark which be why i be not sugarcoat this not even an ounce they will not listen to reason no matter how kindly you put it if they do not like youratmatmatmatmatm you better be prepare for the ban hammer because they silence any and all feedback that involve any kind of actual review with a vengeance and hell this have not even end yet keep read this be start to look like the robocraft holocaust shudder nerf em to the grave now the final kick to the ball here and you may not get up from this one be the repeat nerfing of weapon that have perform perfectly fine and the buffing of weapon that never even need a buff finally there be the issue of render certain vehicular design completely obsolete promote the uncreative design of gun brick with tank tread and tank tread only i will give an example from speedy to needy i make a vehicle call the masterkill b stard frankly can not put the word itself in which operate on two thing wheel downforce and rocket asssiste forward momentum as of 3 day after the r o update my speedy little vehicle be no fast than a treaded tank and that be with the thruster on i guess people can not stand have to exercize their arm hand and finger with the corsshair on their railgun and enjoy the game because this actually happen without rocket it be even slow than a tank believe me i have test this one the day i learn of the horror inflict on the physics engine which i think it be safe to say it be nearly nonexistant now final thought lastly like i say i strongly strongly support this game hell i even put 10 into this game just for hangar bay but as of now freejam have botch their game so much yield to the manipulation of their own community so badly that it be nigh unenjoyable this game have so much potential a year ago but now it be all be dry up freejam have make it evidently clear they do not want to take a step in the right direction a year ago i would give this game a 9 5 out of 10 but as of now i can only in good conscience give it a 4 out of 10 a toxic community confuse development team nonsensical gameplay poor teamplay or constant nerf as a double edge to update and absolutely horrible physics engine torture to death by modification of what it once be all in the name of stay away from make the game overall better simple for personal profit keep me from dare touch this awful nightmare any more after this stay away from this hideous deformed child of a game you will be stricken with it be god awful moba wannabe gameplay more on my review in the comment section,neg
early access reviewhello i be new but i can not go across to speak about bless online i hade in mind this game after all this publicity they make will be like bdo or similar game well i do not hear or read comment about this game and wish make my owen experience whit it after only well 26 hour gameplay i need to say this game if they do not do a big upgrade in all graphic gameplay story line even be simply thing like mount this game will die faster then it come to europe that s my opinion so to say well this game be far from that what they have promis at the start,neg
from many hour of experience i can safely say that this be an amazing and addicting game for people who like to challenge themselves while play with other people dota 2 can indeed be hard for beginner but once you get use to the game you will be enjoy yourself more as long as you be not one of those people who rage quickly and end up abandon thing can be improve to make this game more enjoyable such as the toxcitiy of player which drag many player away from this game but nonetheless in my opinion this game be a great game second edit dota 2 2018 review lot of read ahead it be be a year since the duel fate update and 2 year since the 7 00 update from what i have personally experience in this year of dota i can now say that the game be change a lot many change and introduction have occur in 2018 from the ranked medal to the 7 20 update start from the medal which where the first introduction in 2018 i have personally always like the medal idea and do not really seem to have problem with them be add to the game i personally find that they be suit since many other game have medal for rank why should not dota the next perhaps big thing which be announce in mid february of 2018 be what be know as the bi weekly patch update in a nutshell icefrog have finally speak and look down upon us peasents and finally say we will be release update every two week which will release feature slowly instead of all in one go on a single patch yes people the frog have speak all this be due to the community complain about valve not care so much about update and give way too few hah the irony be that when the bi weekly patch come people eventually hate more on valve for the amount of space they be take up on their hard drive so eventually after the international 2018 championship have come to an end the bi weekly patch just dissapeare the next huge addition to the game be dotaplus which be suppose to apparently be an evolution of the seasonal battlepasse what s my opinion on this well let put it this way about dotaplus what a ing joke people literally only buy it for the hero level so they can have a little badge which show their progression on hero they play for the battlecup because at least dota plus owner get free battlecup tournament access and also for the ranked role a new thing that replace the double down mmr in rank matchmaking which btw take a que time as long as 40 min to an entire hour even not say it still do not infact it be bad from what i have hear in a nutshell pay 3 50 a month so you can have the ability to choose which role you want to search for in rank matchmaking for some weird reason rank role be not the normal way of matchmaking and all those who do not have dotaplus or do not really feel like wait 40 min to find a game around 80 of player will just be stick with me mid or feed oryour mamma pretty much what you see in the eu server nowadays yea pretty disturbing but that just about sum dotaplus in a nutshell next up be spring clean this update be simply amazing and i do hope we get one again for 2019 my favourite bit of this update be the new look of in game player profile must commend valve for this one great work after that come the long await pudge arcana pretty amazing overall especially with a hero like pudge who do not really seem extensive for an arcana i mean it be pudge we be talk about but they do it and it be pretty decent what could have make the arcanum soo much well be a new hook animation not just use the right hand hook but also the back chain hook then again this be my opinion jump ahead we see a lovely summer season kick off summer 2018 with the international 2018 championship battlepass which bring about the lakad matatag meme and it be just beutiful the tournament be great a massive applause to og once again very well deserved towards the end of the tournament day 2 new hero by the name mars and grimstroke be announce and on that day people freak out especially when grimstroke be literally release right after the trailer reveal him autumn come and naturally people be expect a traditional post ti patch to be fully specific the 7 20 patch when 7 20 debutte back on the 19th of november it bring about a lot of change people be wonder how to even play the game anymore i mean bounty hunter now steal gold from enemy when he hit them deny give gold slark gain permanent agility if he or an ally who be next to him get a kill the update in my personal opinion need desperate balance this of course naturally happen and literally 4 sub patch be release in a month but eventually i personally adapt and some of my friend who be at the ancient level have either quit play the game or take a massive break with questionable return tomorrow the start of 2019 the ranked season 3 be expect to debut along a possible update to rank matchmaking which we hope will be effective or at least a lot more effective than previous update to rank matchmaking mars be nowwhere to be see yet but valve say winter so as far as we be concern it could be on the 20th of march althought if you want to see him early buy a mega telescope and find where mars be in the night sky hah good luck with that but seriously do not buy a mega telescope use it to buy dotaplus instead lol the last but not least thing that happen and be soon go to end be the frosthaven event along with the long anticipate rubick arcana release frosthaven be decent but in my opinion frostivu of 2017 be much well as for the rubick arcana it be pretty nice and i would rate it just as much as the pudge arcana to conclude the review of dota 2 in 2018 this year have change load of change i will say it be a decent year for dota 2 it be not amazing but there be great stuff release aswell to cover up for that so one last thing before we conclude 2018 do i still recommend dota 2 as a game the answer be yes it be still amazing and i hope it will become even great in 2019 because for some reason i sense 2019 will be the good

early access reviewthe game be good now a great pile of c r a p comunitly bearly good support team do not give fudge about you i wonder how long this game be go to keep it up not so long i guess many many many many many bug which dev team and support also do not give a fudge about balance in every single aspect be horribleat the end i do not recommend the game no matter the fact that be f2p with microtransaction by look of the other review you can see people be not so fascinated another thing to the guy who create this pile of c r a p i know it be not easy to create develop a game but after a hard work dev the good game you waste your hard work time on slowly but succesfully up the game that be not effective waste of your develop time and by that i mean you s u c k at your profession feel free to ban me if this insult you because i know you ban other player without any good reason and clue it will not be a new thing if you be vent on player who leave a bad review,neg
early access reviewthis be a good game that get some unfair negative review and hate i be go to address some unfair attack at this game the big thing about these negative steam review be that anybody can write them thus many loser player with idiot tank design come here to take out their anger on the game store page this be partly thank to the chat window in the game main lobby where countless 9 year old tell the whole server why they lose because smgs be cheap and not because they rush in alone with their no armor hovercraft in between 5 enemy tank when other normal player lose to an smg tank they see the chat and believe the exaggerated comment and join them then they start vent their anger too the other slightly more fair review i have see be from the old time player who say the game dev ruin the game i be a little new at this than them and i have play almost 40 hour of gameplay in these dark time make it to t5 and have fun all the way and there s no sign of the fun stop any time soon the people who be have fun and there s a lot of us do not bother to write review just the people who want to vent their anger do the first thing people say be that this game be pay2win but that just be not true first of all pay user and free user get all the same part to work with and second in this game your robot have a stat for rank when you add a part to your robot it raise the rank stat and if you reach a certain point it will go up in tier there be 10 tier of robot and you just about always get put against robot in your tier so pay 2 win be impossible the only thing pay do for you be give you fast progression through the tier some people say its pay to progress but i be on top of t5 and i have not have that problem yet although i think during a certain update it be bad but they have already fix that by now progression be not super important anyway because by t5 every type of part be unlock just not the big strong version which be in there own tier unlike world of tank and other f2ps you can still make cool stuff at low tier and there s none of that premium ammo crud that i hate now for the second big thing to talk about op over powered weapon and part every type of weapon get call op 90 time in the same day because of that vent 9 year old thing i tell you about before one big thing to keep in mind be that this game be in alpha so balance be subject to change i hate when people say plasma have ruin this game forever because even if plasma be cheap the dev would rebalance it asap there be only 3 different type of weapon in the game for now and they all have their intend function i be not say the game have always have perfect balance and it still do not but its still a lot of fun to play the last thing about balance be that a lot of player be new to this game and do not know what they can do an example would be that hovercraft can dodge plasma shell vertically but i do not see many player do this those player could go on to say that plasma be cheap or that hovercraft be underpowered but the real problem be that the player do not try new tactic people whine a little about other thing like lag warping and glitch but i have never have those problem those thing be just more problem that people unfairly vent out during their rant overall i just want to tell you that this be a really fun game that can make you think and adapt and also that the dev be not evil i think they give us free stuff as makeup for a server crash they have if the game get big and dev finish this right then this could be a really great and solid game thank for read peace out,pos

early access reviewthis be a good game nice shooting mechanic sound and the atmosphere be on spot but i would rather they lose the cutlery and add ww2 inspire clothing armor instead of wackiness it would be a well marketing point people in 40 clothing fighting thru the mist to get to a safe zone it be very lovecraftian please change the project asap and give it a twist of horror instead of wacky underpant game will get more follower,pos
early access reviewthis game be free how 10 10about 300 room in game start of very simple just cardboard picture of cartoon like ghost and skeleton eventually sh t start get creepy thing start chase you and as research lab database show there be tonne of monster to come the deeper you go i love the mini game a great relief from the game jump scare although i think jump scare be cheap and far too many game use them and go on to tag them as a horror game fnaf this game use them effectively create an eerie atmosphere and make you jump out of your chair at even the cut cardboard cut out while be chase by a head eat resident evil like monster this game have a strange effect as i want to continue on just one room more i tell myself even though that one room could either be a single corridor which i nervously walk down or a dark room in which you magically obtain a flashlight worth the a000 00 i invest and i be look forward to the 1000th room if i ever get there game play 8 10helpless at the start and so far still like that control be simple but work effectively graphic 9 10simple cartoon at start but develop to much dark image polish 8 10funny spooky girl detailed backlog of each monster and fear what more to ask for,pos
ok i will never write a review about any game before but wt deserve one first of all i have be play the game for a couple of year now and it be amazing the vehicle the physics the map everything but suddenly the game become a pay to win game since premium vehicle be so op the vehicle research be ridiculous because it take really a long time to be able to get a new plane or tank and now you can face a 50 or 60 tank with sabot round while you be drive a 40 tank con guy i will not even get to the russian bias part cause seem that gaijin still have not overcome the cold war but the bad part in this once great game be that you will get uptiered every single game no kidding i have get uptiered at every game for the past 2 day my top tank be 5 7 still i be face 6 7 tank or hig so i will not recomend the game untill gaijin stop think only about money and start to think a little about the many issue that the game have thank for read it,neg

great game with many hero to pick from and fight against its definitly worth your time but do remember that hi rez studios the developer and publisher be absalout cancer and most of their game be bad smite however be the exception and be good fun with friend or alone,pos
this game have an amazing way of make grind unique and fun as for get new card without grinding can be difficult because of the lack of card that you can buy from the store and because those card that be in the store be kinda useless but nonetheless amazing game 8 10,pos
early access reviewserver can be a bit off and tooltip be nonexistant in this agme but the core mechanic be sufficiently unique to warrant a good game what sell it be the shooting though real satisfy stuff,pos
early access reviewdear mammoth game i have be play this game for 2 year now and i really feel like i can not play anymore ever since dodging have be remove there be no counter for spam at all which make play this game very frustrating this game be my favorite game of all time until you remove dodge at the moment i will not be play this game again please reconsider remove dodge,neg
overall i would recommend it to anyone you progress quite quickly through the game so money do not have to be spend unless you be really desperate however the big problem be the match make you either smash their team or get smash you can be afk on your team and win with maybe one casualty or work your off and lose awfully this can be fix on future update but apart from that it be a solid game also you can run it on a potato so that be always good,pos
load game create profile get excite due to good looking graphic find out 99 of the content have to be bring start a practice session hold down accelerator spin into the wall change to 3rd person and mouse control fail to go round a corner in gear 2 get crash on pit straight decide to start a race accidentally crash someone end up on my roof and the person who i hit be still go perfectly 11 10 brilliant,pos
dev have lose their sense of reality if a vehicle firepower need to be nerfed unrealistically remove it from the game the stat be break and lack any balance what so ever it look good run good but have zero accuracy on most aspect the game mode be also terrible lacking depth and intellect to even get a more real experience play in more difficult game mode just mean more dumb spawn rule the dev just pile on content instead of expand on what they already have what good be add ten more tank and plane to the game if the game mode be to simple and boring would i recommend this game no,neg
early access reviewif you be look for a free to play card game that combine the good feature of other franchise into one simple and elegant package with tonne of strategic variation and depth you have come to the right place when you start play this game 3 thing hit you immediately 1 the animation be fast and fluid no time be waste on flashy nonsense the animation go through quickly with minimal interruption and still look good so most of your time be spend make decision rather than impatiently watch stuff happen on screen 2 if you be familiar with hearthstone and magic the gathering then this game feel instantly familiar and easy to learn it do not suffer from the rng self destruction vomit that hearthstone have become and it have a much more modern online client interface than the outdated relic of mtg online 3 despite be in early access it already have so much content and even without have a full library of legendary card you have sooo many option in deck construction strategy and interaction without pay a single dime i be so impressed with the elegant design of all the card and in game interface that i buy some of the in game currency just to support the developer but i do not need it you can earn and craft all the card by play very casually there be several mode to play 1 gauntlet against ai deck here you can test your new deck concept and do some casual grinding for gold extremely useful and surprisingly challenging 2 forge also against ai this be basically arena or draft but against ai it cost half as much gold to enter than with draft and the draft itself be cheap anyways forge be good if you love draft arena gameplay but do not like to wait for other player or do not like competitive play too much 3 draft you open a pack and pick one card then you pass it on to someone else and you pick another card from a pack pass by someone else etc until the pack be empty and then you repeat the process for a total of 4 time then you construct a deck from the card you pick and play pvp if you enjoy the competition and have the brain to stay competitive this mode can earn you a lot of gold pack and shiftstone use to craft card good of all you keep the card that you pick include the one you do not use to make your deck 4 rank pvp just like construct in hearthstone nothing special i actually prefer construct over draft due to the incredible creativity of the community but that be just a personal preference i like to test new concept cuz it be so much fun casual pvp but without rank point useful if you just want to enjoy the gameplay and complete quest without affect your current rank 5 event every now and then we get an event with special rule i really like these because they make you think and build your deck in specific way to capitalise on the battlefield condition plus they be incredibly rewarding so it be worth the effort in addition there be quest that require you to play certain color or card type to unlock chest this encourage you to get creative and try new thing just the usual card game incentive i have see most review and steam discussion complain about the resource system mana borrow from magic the gathering indeed you have to play sigil land to gain power mana and play your card truth be tell the number of spell that draw sigil be somewhat limited mtg have many more mana fetch and fix card in eternal you need to give extra attention to include enough sigil fetch card in your deck seek power and find the way be extremely important and card draw engine be a must have in every deck strategy otherwise you will be at the mercy of top deck by turn 7 if you can get accustomed to the mana system and start brainstorm deck idea you be go to love this game especially if you like to be creative if you can not be bother feel free to net deck many new player net deck at first in fact the community be very generous and intelligent and they love to share their idea with new player whatever your playstyle be there be a deck for you feel free to experiment you will be surprise by the magnitude of unlikely synergy you can discover it be very enjoyable to have this eureka moment when test new combo eternal really encourage you to try new card there be a few slightly overused or unbalanced card but most of them be cheap to craft and everything can be easily counter with the right strategy the silence mechanic be particularly powerful and almost essential to counter certain effect i be a little worried about the silence tbh and i really hope they add a revert mechanic similar to hex shard of fate otherwise silence effect would have to be deliberately keep few in number from now on because it be counter interactive and not very fun as far as card game go i give this a solid 7 10 if the dev keep an eye out on card balance and maintain their caution when release new card this game will be an excellent addition to any card game player library especially if you be tired of the old franchise that have become overburdened with their outdated online client try it and keep an open mind you will not be disappoint,pos
tl dr this game be fun it be not pay2win in any kind of way i have read some negative review and have to say something about the p2w aspect it be not pay2win you have to buy well tower and their upgrade with ingame currency which be award by win game you pay to a special amount of coin to play a game if you win you get two time as much back you start with 0 coin and by win 7 game you get a ranking in the world region ladder where reach different rank award a good amount of coin every wednesday so if you start play sunday you get how the game work on monday win a few game on thusday and get the coin on wednesday you have go from 0 to 1000 coin in 3 day and max 30 win after this you could get world first in your second week of play even in the first week because it be play2win on another note you need to win game to unlock the purchase of well tower and their upgrade so once more you need to play to get better also if you do not want to waste your money do not spend any i have about 25000 coin after my first week which be about 100 in reallife,pos
early access reviewi like the game easy on the eye nice physics on movement and shoot not hit a laggy server fast pace but not manic like doom or unreal map remind me of cod black op nuke nice balance between camping and rushing player just over an hour in not see any hacker as yet one of the best free to play shooter i have play in year congrat to the dev nice job guy,pos
early access reviewreally fun card game that s a bit slow than pace than the other popular free to play card game in the marketheavily influence by magic the gathering especailly be able to interact during the opponent turn which be not surprising consider the people behind the game love the arena system that not only let you keep the card you draft but also let you edit your deck something game like hearthstone and shadowverse be lack i think the deck size for construct be a bit too high so its difficult to have a consistent deck and also i have be play this game a lot and still be not able to collect enough card to have a tier 1 2 construct deck but i guess that s where the free to play player have to compromise also would love for a well singleplayer campain but that should be come soon 8 10 could be a 9 10 with well singleplayer support,pos
realm of the mad god rotmg be an incredibly addicting game which feature perma death whilst many dislike lose everything upon death it be also a very rewarding game when you start up it be quite difficult but the more you play the well you get you eventually learn tactic and figure out the good course of action for you and your character it be important to focus both long term and short term as anything could happen at any give time be reckless be one of the main reason why people lose character so it be important to always stay calm do not let your greed for loot get in the way of your character safety i personally enjoy rotmg because it allow me to do whatever i want if i want to feed and upgrade my pet i do that if i want to max a knight or a mystic i do that if i want to do dungeon i do that,pos

this be the action rpg we be wait for a spiritual successor to diablo ii path of exile take the formula and put its own spin on it with their own class lore atmosphere and leveling system i think this game take most of the thing that diablo iii do wrong and fix them as well as provide an item system that be while familiar totally different than any other game i have play and it work really well so well that i would dare say it be by far the good in its category when i first try this game i be kind of disappointed that the class choice seem limited however when i actually start play i soon come to realize that you can play any of the class in any way you want dual wielding wand marauder sure range duelist yup there be absolutely no restriction on how you build your character because of the near infinite combination of passive skill point you receive each level on top of that the skill in this game be a lot like the materia system from final fantasy vii only with exponentially more variety it be very in depth and allow for crazy customization of your ability by modify them with certain support gem i can not count the time when i discover a brand new way to build my character just by pick up an interesting new gem i can not fit everything i like about this game into a single review but since it be completely free to play another amazing feature i recommend you get this game as soon as you can and see for yourself,pos
product receive for freeearly access reviewedit great news everyone there be a new expansion just to make the game even more suicidal have fun i have have this game for age and it use to be great now it be just ok too much have be change to the game and while sometimes change and new thing be good i beleive it have spoil a once awesome game weapon be unbalenced there be a new rocket thing that i call the noob cannon because it be too easy to get kill by one die be too easy in general espect to die at least 10 time a match there be no normal mode like there use to be and game be really unfair now say a team be win and they have capture all the point it make it even harder because then their base shield go down and the winner go up so if you start lose you probably will these be just some of the problem with this game if you be a brand new player want to try out some newgame then go for it but if you have either play the game before all the thousand of update or if you be look for a casual yet fun game that play well look good and get you motivated to get out of bed then i suggest you get a time machine and go back a few year seriously look at the negative review they be almost all from player with 100 hour they know how good it use to be,neg

this be a fun game lot of action with room for growth and expertise if you like to excel you can develop your tank and get well but that be where it end unless you pay the cash you will find that many time round after round that you will be deluge with opponent who be much fast in speed even though your rank with the same category their armor seem to be thick take multiple hit up into the teen where you can get destroy with one to three hit by ammunition that be more powerful buy with gold i be sure it be not hard to realize these have be purchase where your side do not have overwhelming attack capability there be a lot of dissension on the discussion board about this some say that more skill be need when you find yourself lose with 6 to 7 opponent tank stand to none on your side on many many many occasion it be not hard to realize that this game be design to cause fraustration so that you can get your mommy to buy you a 100 00 tank it be all design to manipulate people to pay money for this game an if you show negativity they will let you know the game be bias for a reason i play it but i be get so tired of one sided battle over and over and over again then you get match with equal and it be a lot of fun but trust me it will not last the store buy tank always be rank against you again overall i give this a thumb down it be a shame because it could really be a great game,neg

where do i even begin with this between the random crit fair and balanced guy funny joke poor and often terribly unbalanced matchmaking infrequent update and for the most part atrocious community why would you even play this game i have no answer to that question but for the past year i have sink about 3 000 hour into it anyway no matter what happen i just can not hate this game the same reason that pull people out of it can be what keep other in it have such a unique set of mechanic and force a high skill ceiling because of it it can be frustrating but it can also be rewarding and i have love every hour i have spend on it for well or for bad there be no real way i can describe how it have keep me hooked all i can say be that you need to play it for yourself,pos
highly recommend good diablo style arpg out there right now and you can play it as much as you want free i throw some cash at it during a sale on stash tab but all other microtransaction be cosmetic recommend start when a new season be about to begin start with fresh trading economy go until your character hit a wall or you get tired of the grind the leveling up of a new character be my favorite part so do not sweat have or want to reroll it be normal and that skill tree oh man so good,pos

early access reviewi really want to give this game a good review because it be really fun and have some good concept it show a lot of promise but there be just one problem the launcher updater be god awful one of the bad thing be that it automatically seed after download by default which be pretty annoying to start but you can still turn it off so it be forgivable right no such luck whenever you turn off seed after download the launcher will automatically turn it on again every update it be just too bad and it be extremely annoying please fix this issue or get a well updater and i will give a thumb up,neg

as a longtime magic player who then become a longtime hearthstone player and then get kind of tired of play both eternal land in a nice spot in between them that check a lot of box eternal have a lot more in common with magic than hearthstone and be probably what magic would be if it be develop today as a purely digital game get rid of all that messy complicated cardboard some thing that i like about eternal there be some rng in draw too much power e g mana or too little but there be way to mitigate that before the new set and the new set actually add a lot more way to deal with it in pledge and amplify generally speak the game let you play your deck against your opponent deck and there be lot of decision to make the ideal for any strategy card game game be generally over pretty quickly hearthstone for be a simple game have game that drag on at least for me anymore i like the quick play that eternal afford eternal be very generous you get ton of free pack free card and all sort of stuff just for play the dusting be more generous than other game and you can put together a decently competitive list on the cheap downside yes the tutorial can drag a bit as can some of the single player gameplay you have to commit to if you want to unlock all the card in the campaign but it really be good reptition to learn the game and if you break through there be lot of different way to play that let you mix it up when you get bored overall i be happy to have find eternal and it will be my go to card game for the immediate medium and possibly distant future give what other game be out on the market now,pos

so i hear about this game quite some time ago but i do not really bother with it because i hear it run terrible even on high end rig have it change not really it be still pretty laggy and i just can not get it over 35 fps in fight and that be quite dissapointing but if you do not really care about that like me you should be fine gameplay the gameplay be good it be just a good first person shooter with alot of people in one war to conquer a whole map the battle be huge with sometimes 50 vs 50 and you will obviously die alot but it be not frustrating to die like in other game where you want to throw the controller or whatever be on your desk away graphic i have almost everything on ultra and then the game will look very nice and detailed effect and explosion be realistic but i be not so pleased with the sound it be okay but not great final verdict great game but you will need a serious pc if you want to enjoy the most out of the game specs pentium g3258 overclocke 8 gb crucial ballistix and the gtx 750ti,pos

early access reviewmy favorite free to play fps alongside warface do not take a whole lot to run and i can play it on my potato i3 laptop with minimal lag balanced gun and gunplay that you will not find on nearly any other free to play fps overall amazing game edit as of 1 september 2018 this game have go down the drain they recently release a new map and 2 gun which be poop the map be only a tdm map so that tell you something the fact that it take a whole year for them to add another map other than sabotage really say something about the dev so where have all the money we spend on box and key go you may ask well i will tell you what it have not go towards 1 a work anti cheat2 well maps3 well servers4 worthwhile improvement to the base system of the gameman this game have so much potential i love it for the short time i play it when it first come out and then when i come back to it but its flaw outshine it be strength back to cs go at least there the cheater can get report,neg
this game have sooooooo much potential it have the versatile feel of old school console game with the new concept of mmorpg interface with online friend and stranger the system be simple the game itself be fast paced there be multiple opportunity to unlock achievement and a nearly bottomless system for weapon and armor my only complaint be that outside of the initial two or three class the only way to unlock further class be to spend real money while the game bill itself as a free to play experience in order to get any real development out of the game content be to spend cash the game also like to drive that home by 1 make the bulk of the achievement revolve around thing that you can only get through cash exchange and 2 frequently drop cool item that be only usable by the pay class into the hand of mundane player while i can recognize the validity and necessity of have game be pay to play i neither think it be fair of a company to present a pay to play game as anything but that and i dislike game that stunt the growth and exploration of the player through monetary contingency as a compromise the game could have an in game mechanic that allow for the gradual accrual of real money much as be see in loadout it be a shame the game be so impact by the requirement of real cash because that really prevent it from become a hugely popular game but even so i rate this a 7 out of 10 check it out but be ready to either break out your wallet or get irritated that the game only let you go so far,pos
early access reviewyou can see that i spend one hour in the game but i only give this game the final shot before write this review and unfortunately for this game it take this long to get into single battle i start to play it in late 2014 use robocraft launcher and manage to reach t7 in 3 4 day or so queue time be short and battle be fun though the more i progress the more cheater i see it be the main problem those day developer try to make authoritative server to solve the issue but fail at that because of obvious reason and choose easyanticheat since it be client thing it do not filter all the cheater and cause issue for many fair player because of how it be design after a while they decide to push another update where they remove repair cost completely many player like it but mostly those who could not build a proper robot and those who often leave the battle in the middle of the game in another huge update they change the default game mode that be a mistake once again because new game mode be bug and each round take a lot of time make the player both play with half a team because of explain above reason and wait much longer between round of course there be some good update and thing too like megabot and medic but they can not overweight the bad one i stop to play this game because it be very choppy seriously i post bug report relate to this several time almost a 8 9 month ago and it be still not fix last time i even explain solution to this and that fact be ridiculous currently it be 3 month since unity 5 1 include beta be out and it have authoritative server functionality build in guess what they keep use eac s instead of it they create some vacancy on their site because they can not fix their game on their own they expect that some one will come and fix everything for them i do not believe they will ever fix their mess,neg

current state if you can get pass the performance issue it be a great game i still would not recommend it until they fix that side2016 update i want to write a full breakdown of change between the last 2 year but i do not have enough space so i will go fast on each point 1 desync fixed2 performance still sucks3 the last expansion be release too early full of bugs4 challenge can be complete with less farming and get improved5 trading get improve a bit but idd still love a self find league6 balance powercreep be of the chart expect change in next league7 no one care about pvp so they be not go to focus on it anymore not surprised here original review first thing i should mention be that this review do not takle what path of exile do best but what a release game should be and should not 1 desync there be no need argue about it be presence in game we know it be in the game on a daily presence and that it will affect your gameplay skill that will make you desync flicker strike cyclone since you move when you use these skill usage of shift to stop you from move on server client side will not help gameplay that will make you desync even though it be present overall in the game the most desync part of the game be dominus fight especially his first part if you try to kite and move behind cover you will desync at least once per fight it will not kill you in 90 of the case but nevertheless be still annoying as hell desync be responsable for many hardcore death every day server side problem combine with desync last time this happen 4 6 player die from a hardcore party one of them be level 90 2 performance depend on your playstyle if you play alone in town eternal laboratory or any other empty place i manage to get 170 fps when you start play the game it will go to 60 70 if you be do a end game map with some special mod it will drop to 30 50 if you play in a party the performance will be low because there be more stuff go on but some time it will go to 1 when certain skill be use death animation will make you drop fps if you kill large pack of monster range attack and spell discharge lightning arrow fireball freeze pulse ice spear poison arrow will lower your framerate but only in end game or when use in a combination with cast on crit the game will just not work properly if you have a creative sound card cpu bind change your graphic option will not make a big difference in fps gain or loss during fight even if you have 1 fps the game will not use more than 30 40 of your graphic card depend on how powerfull it be 3 bug yes we know that every game have bug but in a end game focus on map drop you should work on fix them first monster stick behind wall and can not be reach this happen a lot on shipyard map level 77 top tier map 1 level below max map level and if you do not kill last 5 10 monster you may just not get a map drop when you do not get any map last few monster have a good chance of drop 1 or even more map you be kick from the server and can not join the map again these happen twice in a almost half year period every patch be plague with game break bug last time they have to roll back because more than 1000 char die on hardcore even the dev will tell you not to play soon after a patch be release especially on hardcore 4 challenge system and how it affect the gameplay and drop since they add the challenge system we see a change on where the unique item require to complete a specific challenge drop you have kaoms heart and shavronne drop only from level 76 map before you could get them by just farm level 66 67 content for a few month the price be also low the only reason they add map only unique item drop be because they have 61 people complete challenge before so they want to lower that number only challenge in get 8 out of 8 challenge complete be get all the unique item to get them all you will need at least 250 exalted orb let us say you be play like 7 hour a day 7 7 day a week even you make 10 exalted orb a week it will take you at least 25 week keep in mind that the first few week you will invest most of your currency in upgrade your gear and progress rather than store it this be not something skill base if you speak about skill it be not even reward in or outside the game chris will go and interview popular streamer instead of skilled even though they be pretty popular in the path of exile scene not even when we have the first player reach level 100 max in path of exile there be a frequent joke make on forum that the only hard part of this game be the magic find slider how much can you get without big drawback 5 trading you hate action house in other game well you will hate this trading system even more there be no proper way to search on forum both forum and trade channel be fill with spam people just stay in town and buy sell both currency or item this be the same problem diablo 3 have where people play the action house instead of the game because it be the good way to get good gear in game 6 balance the new monster hit harder compare to old monster even though they use the same skill a monster make before do 5 the monster do 20 40 moba style of balance change to skill even though it be promise in different interview that there will not be nerf when someone find a cool build that do seem the case and it go as far remove a skill from in game phase run even though it be still on the webpage and a flask which be later add back with a nerfed version at the release 9 unique item be nerfe every new unique item or skill gem have a drawback you can say that unique item have at least 2 drawback now 7 promise for the release we where promise that they will take feedback from player on their forum but the respond more on reddit rather than on the main forum and even with all the feedback they still will do whatever they want make you just waste your time it be not just me say this there be a lot of people that play this game since close beta and have the same opinion private league still wait on news it seem they completly forget about it pvp may be deliver in next patch be promise in the release patch like it be for diablo 3 trading system revamp again push back to god know when act iv push back to march 2014 weekly update now update will be make every 2 week optimization still wait on it clan guild you have a guild tag and a chest that lag every time you put or take something out of it there be actually no reason to have a guild chest unless you want to troll people with the most worthless item you can find in game there be no guild banner or shirt or any customization whatsoever to it custom rogue exile through steam workshop again no news about itat the current state of the game i would not recommend it maybe in 1 2 year it will be well

free to pay as much as i would like to love this game because i love the movie i just can not the game fall very short in my opinion for two main reason the first be that at time the control can be frustratingly cumbersome especially during flight sometimes it take a while to register a turn or boost but maybe this be just due to time the second be that you be bombard with advertisement for membership additional perk and boost which i be really not interested in and probably do little to actually enhance the game itself i do not mind a bit of advertising these however be in your face particularly on the loading screen which i like to contain useful in game information such as hint or history there be nothing wrong with micro purchasing in a game it be down to how well it be present that count and unfortunately it seem that a lot of the item or area be unlockable only if you pay thereby limit the actual amount of freedom you do get to explore while you can explore freely to an extent it be pretty linear in that you must follow the path set out for you and play through before you can really move onto the next one good thing about the game be that you can choose between solo and multiplayer but after awhile it become samey and i quickly lose interest sad because it have the potential to be a great game,neg
early access reviewi would like to give an in game review except i could not get in game and when the game do launch the developer have lock charater creation on server to balance player load effectivly cut me off from play with my friend who have already start on the intial server neowiz have have the bad concept of an mmo launch in which i have ever experience launch 1 server at a time until they feel the server can not take it anymore then lock it and create another instead of fix these issue they just continue this proccess a potentinally promising mmo screw by a developer who be aware of the game issue cause it be failure over sea release they choose to ignore the problem and not fix them and cause new problem with how they decide to launch one server at a time,neg
there be nothing much i can say aside from that there be a nude mod for this game and be surprisingly addictive as the title suggest its a clicker and i recommend an auto clicker like gs auto clicker which be free which get you through the zone quicker however high zone will slow you down even with an auto clicker my other recommendation be once you buy one or a few helper with some level then you must save and exit and wait about one week which help with grinding and then you can rinse and repeat alternatively you can wait longer if you do not plan on come back to this game frequently also there be a nude mod which make dlc kinda pointless but to each their own,pos

early access reviewmy how far this game have fall i have be into this game since pretty damn near the beginning back then it be a sense of adventure to rank up through the tier and level both of which be very hard to increase so the challenge be there that sense of yeah i build that when you finally make that perfect bot be also brilliant those day be long since past the tiering system be go entirely and it be so easy to level up that when i start the game after it be first change i jump from 55 to 100 instantly and i hear you could jump from even further back than that the game menu be so clunky now and they be hard to navigate i still do not know what many of my button mapping actually do on the menu but they do something the colouring system be a neat idea though it be just a consolation prize for lose the tiering system but you have to be premium to actually have creativity with the colour which be just marvelous oh no more tech point there go the fun in unlock thing too the community robot factory while well intend be just a plagiarism facility at bad and at good utterly annihilate that thrill of finally complete a robot which you build yourself also how much be these weapon ten million rp for a single top power weapon get stuff i as not payin that i only get like 50 100k per battle medic bot have be render obsolete as have any form of stategy in the game and the building by the auto heal feature if you do actually take damage you can hide behind a corner and get all your health back what a load of and the pilot seat be remove so no need to worry about protect the weak spot now i really miss the old boss battle megabot challenge couple of strong bot against a full team of weak one that be actually really fun and it be balance too guess they decide it give the veteran player too much enjoyment and they do not want noobs rage quit after one of these fight so it be go now bad of all the game crash a lot more than it use to which really piss me off as if you be in the middle of a battle see ya no reward for you we just wanna waste your time bye i swear the amount of time i hear a player have disconnect in one match be frightening just before i crash myself i remember the day when i use to enjoy this game but now it be both too complex and too simple at once complex in the sense that all those cube variation inner slope edge slope what what be these for at least they refund all those new garage payment i make so now i have thousand upon thousand of free gc so there be that at least update time so they change the mechanic again by change price so they be a bit cheap fine that be alright it be a good start what be not so good be that they lower the maximum reward whilst raise the minimum one so now you earn roughly the same amount of rp whether you be complete crap or absolutely amazing to quote our intent be to help boost the rp income of below average skilled player so they feel they could make progress regardless and to lower the bonus obtain for do exceptionally well to something far more reasonable so now what now there be zero incentive to actually put effort in to get good at the game because you still get a decent amount of rp just for participation this just downright insult those who have take the time to learn and master the game by restrict the value of their skill and patronize the weak and make it so that they do not have to actually master the game at all add this factor to the appalling matchmaking and you get a complete and utter mess of a competitive game if you do exceptionally well at something you expect to be reward for it if you be bad you be deprive of that reward so you have incentive to get well so you will earn that reward but no everyone get similar amount now it be as if the dev want to be modern day robin hood or those feminist try to sort out the mythical wage gap that no one can prove exist there be a well way to fix the progression issue stop make everything so goddamn expensive even with these price drop most of the top tier weapon be seven million or so anyway so what be the point of all this well at least they try they kill off all of their veteran with this change but they try i know some of you will call this nitpicking but when you see how much of a stupid concept this all be update again ok they revert the reward change i take back all that i say before good to see that the dev be actually listen to the community for once let us see where the future take the game now they still have a bit to fix,neg

early access reviewits look like minecraft but it have its own particular style the game have its own way of playing and be honestly a little tough the enemy be creative but i find that the fighting them be fairly annoying due to the fact no matter how accurate you be you do not always hit them and they will always hit you when your close there be a ridiculous amount of thing you can use to build and even have its own system where it show you how to build a particular build the teleporter be extremely useful there will be no lose your home with them i really wish they would add a map so i could actually navigate a little well overall its on par with minecraft and be its own game with a ton of addition and difference that seperate it from minecraft of course thing be bind to change so it could go anywhere from here,pos

so far this be the close game i have see that actually resemble all out war massive amount of player all attack each other at the same time each with different side strategy and weapon pretty good map as well the class seem rather basic at first but then there be all the different weapon upgrade ability and strategy that can be use with each one a seemingly very well think out game it also incorporate the social aspect of gaming by allow the creation of outfit platoon and squad my only problem with it be the not so brilliant graphic mainly the player model and the fact that a great deal of in game item require game currency that need to be purchase for real money or a lot of farming can you farm pc or be it an npc specific thing the grahic be compare to those of some game pretty good but be not great even on the high graphic quality set overall however it be a pretty good game with some good ideasrating graphic 6 10weaponry variation 10 10weaponry realism 9 10world 9 10overall 8 5,pos

early access reviewi play for once match i think i start out fairly good a mosin nagant with a sniper do not have any tutorial or anything but the key for pick up stuff walk aim n such be not that different from usual i hear some fighting in the distance i keep watch over my shoulder to make sure i be not be follow then i spot my first enemy he do not see me and walk right past me you would think a naked body would stand out against a bunker wall headshot grab his walter pistol then the zone become small i run along the river and see the second person in the game i line up my sight shoot him shoot him again dead nothing but empty weapon as the zone become small and small i end up in a destroy village during this whole match i seem to have lucke out hear mostly only distant gunfire the graphic be great and the map sure be big as hell nothing the size you see call of duty ever make and all this time i feel happy by the beauty of the map by the placement of bush and bunker and even the destroy town be a work of art to me and then it strike me this map be too good for just a battle royale game another battle royale game something that ruin the current gaming industry how can such beauty where an entire battlefield could rage where tank could further destroy the already destroy town why be not the map allow to be a feature of such a fight instead 32 player be wander around in their underpant look for gun and cooking equipment,neg
this game be basically try to tell us that jumpscares be really creepy no matter if they be a creepy face like the one in the scary maze game or a ing cute pumpkin you just walk around from room to room and then suddenly a e cardboard with a cute slime appear in your face and boom you need new pant well it become really scary when some creepy dead lady want to eat you and start follow you forever my advice in this situation be to never look back just run for your life and try not to stop and scream at some little cute ghost cardboard have fun,pos

early access reviewas it say this be an early access review in other word the game will improve over time if you do not wish to play the game when it be incomplete you be not suitable for beta testing or any testing for that matter stay away from this currently incomplete game you have be warn just like every other ae game this have the same concept farm it be extremely grindy like seriously if you hate any form of grinding or too much grinding then stay away as well there be new feature such as craft and now even the pumpkin lord armour be farmable which be a great step forward for non p2p player in other word it be more farmy and less cashy just like how an ae game should be for anyone that complain that the pumpkinlord armour be too hard to farm due to low level join in the dungeon they have cap it and be now much more easy a new area have be release and guess what more farming before anyone start complain that the hard area be too hard it be probably because you be too low level basically a newbie not an insult here i take back my previous statement about level be less important though they be super important because the good armour currently available in game be level 15 if you be new to ae game i really do not recommend this because the story do not flow yes ae game be make in such a way that if you never play any other game make by them the story will feel very weird and rush as a long time player of all their game i can say that their lore be extremely deep for example the plot twist about artix and gravelyn actually make sense if you look back at their past storyline you will actually see why sepulchure backstory be personally my favourite and the way he die t t basically if you want to start on this game play all of its prequel if you wish to just jump into this game without any knowledge of how ae game work you will have a 50 chance of either love it or hate it,pos
i recommend this game to your friend and my friend because of the amazing day and night cycle in the game that really shape place in the game this mmofps have very stunning gameplay and graphic through what i have see and hear through search there be some bug for example when my friend land his aircraft he randomly die if your computer can handle this game i would seriously recommend this game the game do have some downfall as to when your in a massive battle your frame per second go down dramatically like i say i recommend this game to all shooter fan you do need a pretty high end computer and graphic card to get on this game though because of the stunning visual,pos
early access reviewi want to recommend this game because it in its self be a fun game however there be many draw back pro it run automatically well than most free to play game have a lot of potential a counter strike sort of gameplay for those who enjoy that buy gear at the beginning with credit get kill for credit etc very fast pace gameplay and heavily rely on reaction to event this be an opinion for me small map work very well for this game they be no large than a counter strike or call of duty map con no unlocking or loot system only item in game be cosmetic buy with real money nothing expensive most item be 1 or 2 but the point still stand game disconnect from match 75 of the time force the user to loose all credit towards their next rank they gain that match very unbalanced certain gun rule the game and other be useless the spa 12 shotgun be one of if not the good gun and you can buy it with the credit you get when you start the match also many gun be over power under powered bad aim too good aim etc the shotgun can only hit up to about 5 yard and if its not point blank then its 1 damage the pistol have no recoil give those who be good with them or hacker more on that later a very easy chance the assault rifle be crap bad recoil large cone of fire damage regard range be bad aks give more damage at 10 yard than an m4 carbine clipping error the model and entity clip into eachother often headshot this one sound like a pro but its not the head hitboxe on a player be massive make nearly every shot you take a headshot and an instant kill lag i know you would think a game thaat do not require much of a computer and only a 200 mb download would not lag much but it seem you be wrong certain gun when fire cause small lag spike as if the audio animation and effect have never be precache or load at all then shoot them again cause the same lag like its loading it brand new again cause the fast pace gameplay to be choppy and ultimately make you loose hacker good lord the hacker it be mostly small child aimbotte with the starting pistol normally that would be fine but consider 2 of the other con mention that pistol be a 1 hit kill when its a headshot even if you have the max armor upgrasde which double your health and the head hitboxe be enormous that be say they instantly kil you this game need an anti cheat badlyall in all i would probably say a 5 10 with ton of room for improvement and a lot of potentional if the dev fix those con and bug and implement a work anti cheat of some sort this be none of right now then i can see my review change to positive and my time spend play this game go up drastically maybe even buy some item from the ingame store,neg

over the last year since gaikin add the italian tree the quality of the game be be deteriorate personally i think the dev be just try to milk the game as much as possible before it die do not play this for the plane mode since the developer only care about the tank mode the plane mode be stale and unbalanced even though the tank mode get 98 of the developer attenion it too be unbalanced with a large percentage of ammo type be infinitely inferior to other plane mode have the same issue but way bad any vehicle with a rating of 3 3 be not worth grind for and play in the current state of the game american plane be the only one worth play in the current state of the game tank with h e a t be the only one worth play in the current state of the game you will always become poor in the free currency this be because it be very hard to be profitable when play against people who have be play since the start of the game these player have memorise every vehicle weakness and as a casual player you will constantly get meme on if you still wish to play the game here be some tip for fly plane in realistic modeclimb at the start of the match climb climb to 500 m to 1 5k high than your optimal altitude check stat card learn learn what you nation do best for example america go fast japan turn russia isngreat at low altitude play to those strength switch you info to metric everyone else use it for tank combat turn on the low graphic seyting possible it make it easy to spot the enemy upgrade the range finder skill and bind it to a key,neg

early access reviewearly review only a few hour of play expect a maybe above average ccg be blow away by everything i have see so far art style be everything i want in a ccg and the general feeling be great so far be a magic player back in the 90 and up till about 10 year ago try various ccgs since then both digital and old school but this be where i have be the most impressed by far and i have only just get into it super easy to pick up and the rest be up to your card and the use of them almost do with the starter campaign and can not wait for the game to really get go from there tl dr just get it,pos
early access reviewi currently have 37h in this game and it be kinda stress me out sometimes but it be fun have play a ton of other card game before i feel like this game balancing be really not on point there be just a ton of situation where you or your opponent can do absolutely nothing the legendarie in this game be crazily strong compare to other card game but what i really do not like be the mana system it be kinda like magic the gathering the irl card game i do not know how if the video game s be the same you have to play so call power card to gain mana to be able to play actual card this mean that alot of time get a hand full of these power card and nothing to play or the other way around and just lose atleast one third of the deck have to be power card so for example sometimes you draw like 10 power card in a row with the minimum decksize of 75 in short if you think hearthstone be a rng heavy game the luck of the draw that you need in this game be insane in comparison but if you want to get into this game it be not that hard to craft your first deck because you can farm the pve mode pretty easily if you have a bit of experiene the game have pretty interesting mechanic though that need some time to get into which enable some completely overpowered combo that just instantly win you the game overall i have to say that i have fun play this game but i recommend something else until they rework some stuff edit i just get access to magic the gathering arena and have to say that both game play very similar with their mechanic do not remember it that way also you can get a bunch of free pack with twitch prime for eternal if you be interested,neg

  look like a ps2 game crash on tame your first dragon sometimes crash when there be too many player fire not sure how many be too many yet this only happen to me once have not encounter many crash other than those playerbase range from 7 year old child to 18 not a good thing since there be a chat box heavy chat restriction but can be easily bypass by add xs or qs or any other letter you wish in front of each word no real gameplay value past minigame multiplayer race for trophy point and ship battle for gem egg saddle etc after finish all of the quest ship battle in a nutshell hover dragon at the respawn area and spam f or fireball at ship for abt 2 min then wait 2 hour for the event repeat you can not fight other dragon or trainer only in a quest where you fight the red death which happen once in your vikings playthrough toothless be the only dragon that be really satisfy to fly member only lot of dragon but not much use for them most of them be for show boneknapper for example cool dragon bad stat can not race and there be well dragon for ship battle the only two use that a dragon can have besides for look race and battle event kind of a dragon collecting game because of the above i have see veteran player flex their entire collection of dragon on other player that be pretty much all you can do with most of them not only be most dragon essentially useless but they cost gem which you be suppose to spend real money on i mean if you like run and fly around interact with people this be a good game for that oh and quest they run out after a while though can not replay them after that then you need to make a new viking yeah microtransaction suck but the game do not have the good security against people who want to exploit the game it be especially bad in 2015 or so anyone could get infinite gem 2 year later there be still exploit that need to be fix overall a decent game if you like collect dragon and fly them around and be willing to deal with get gem for them just do not buy gem though only try membership if you be think about it i play this game to decompress it be not that fast paced i would not recommend sod to a friend to play a game it be more about the social aspect than play a game you would likely have more fun interact with people than race or do battle event however sod be not the only place you can talk to people so that do not make this particular game stand out much i would like to see more gameplay add in like other duel option than fireball frenzy or another use for dragon like the boneknapper he be average with speed and firepower but he have a lot of armor and spike maybe there can be a new minigame where bulky dragon can destroy thing with melee attack they be start to improve the graphic in some area like the training ground and the school which be nice the water at the school be honestly the good looking part of the game graphic 4 10gameplay 4 10fun factor 4 10gets bore after a while i log on every once in a while to fly around then log off flight be one of those mechanic in game that be kind of hard to come by especially if it be both free flight and it be an integral part of the game to compare with mmorpg like rider of icarus and world of warcraft these two game be just overdone and too detailed i like school of dragon because of its simplicity and focus on the dragon it also be not an eyesore for me compare to roi or wow there be just a lack of content in game more thing to do than quest battle event and race would be a good place to start work,neg
after have play this game for almost a year i can not suggest it the game be a good concept drive to the grow by bad marketing and unbalance the basic of the game be you run around in glitchy map and try to do quest that may or may not exist anymore after level up 68 69 level you will experience an extreme grind to 70 which be the cap end game content include you run for almost a month in the same map do the same 3 quest every week with little to no compention if you be hope pvp be well try again as it be highly unbalanced with trickster rogue which will stun you into death and can go invisible take the lead the next pvp prefered class be paladin which can restore their own hp so good luck die to them if you choose any other class besides those get ready as the dev and everyone involve with this game love and exploit you for your money oh and if you want to bot exploit or scam you can too just add money every week and they will not even ban you for cheat they will suppend you for a week top i know its a great system in any word ready to be exploit and use because neverwinter be for you,neg

early access reviewi remember this game be fun in 2014 before the dev start to phase out the veteran player base in favor of casual gamer it be still beyond me why exactly the dev decide to do this but one thing be for certain they have already create a fantastic smart and challenging game then they start to chip away all those little thing that make robocraft unique and enjoyable untill only a shallow husk of it be former glory remain there be many review here that describe the step by step process the dev take to ruin robocraft so for the sake of keep this short i recommend you to read them instead as for the future of robocraft nothing good can come of the new direction that the dev decide to take the game in as of late 2015 the game have be slowly die i only hope that the dev see reason and restore it back to the way it use to be before it be completly dead i have now stop play the game there be nothing good fun or challenging left in robocraft anymore shame on you freejam you greedy bastard,neg

early access reviewrobocraft robocraft be mean to be a fun enjoyable game but now this game have turn into a pile of s when i first play this game it be enjoyable up until the update come out now this game feel like a mobile game with microtransaction everywhere when i first play this game you could buy the beginning weel for free and the block for free now you have to use in game money to buy everything and that have ruin this game and also the fact that they add loot crate be a good idea but heres the bad part you do not get everything from the loot crate unless you have a premium account what be the point of there be loot crate if you need to buy a premium account to get everything from it and since you need a premium account what be the point of the loot crate i be very disappointed at the developer they have ruin this game this lovely game they have ruin,neg
early access reviewi use to really like robocraft everything about it be fun the game be good and people like it then the developer basically admit to decide to change the entire game on a whim now it seem like a money grab with slow progression a bloated set of weapon and block and too much content that have not be balance,neg

  you must be desperate if you call this fun this game be what you get if you steal code from dayz mod add skin from cs go and h1z1 into one game i start this game know it be complete i just want to know how bad it really be when i first spawn i have some bizarre glow around me and i can only assume it be a shield keep me from be spawn kill i then turn my camera and have my first little giggle rotate the camera cause the character to spazz out and break its back i do this for about a minute second thing i try naturally be attack a zombie just to see how deadly they be melee with a flashlight do nothing btw however that be far less important than the clearly steal code and animation from dayz mod for the zombie if you play the mod of dayz you know what i be talk about i really do not last much longer after this i enter a near by hanger and see what i can only describe as a truck from a play station 1 game and that be a generous comment but what really get me be the fact that all of the gun have thick blue outline so you could see them honestly i can not say just how embarrased these dev should feel about this game last but certainly not least when you die you have to wait 8minutes to respawn your character i do not understand why people let themselves be suck into these trap i feel like they have horrible computer and justinternet and do not have much choice or something along those line i really hope steam ban these dev from ever publish a game on their platfrom i be really surprised they have allow it to remain,neg
i do not know if clicker heroes be the first game of that kind but it certainly be my first so i consider it as it and compare all the other game to it if there be one thing do right there beside the many thing be that it feel honest to you you never feel cheat on because everythings mathematically correct sakura clicker feel like a rushed game because of many reason but the progress be certainly one of the bad you feel like the developer just try something to see how it go without put much thinking into it most of the game be a copy paste of clicker hero ascension include but with all of the functional change do wrong this end up in upgrade cost be too high for the damage deal so the only good thing to do be to upgrade each ally 3 to 5 time then wait to buy the next one and that wait mean close the game and come back later i know that happen to clicker hero too but here i mean literally play 2 minute then idle for 5 hour or more all the time since the aug 3rd update this situation get well because the dev raise the damage a great lot but that also prove the fact that this whole thing be just badly plan at the beginning and it still do not feel right this game suffer from many problem and even though the dev seem to listen to the player and actually implement stuff that most people be ask that could have be do before release it and anyway we be far from something work right it all feel like a cardboard game with little to no animation the only one be the enemy close their eye when beat just a few 8 bit like sound effect and a short looping music that will get annoy very soon the character design be nice but it be just an excuse to attract people because that be really the only good thing of this game that say those girl be just random and there do not seem to be any pattern in their dress boss be just the same girl but strong your character be show on the playfield and you can change its appearance in a specific tab of the game most stuff have to be purchase with real world money before be able to wear it like the most sexy dress and that be the only thing you can purchase the problem be that it just stand there do nothing so it do not really make sense to even be there this game really feel like a quick cash grab as there be nothing interesting to do while it run beside purchasing upgrade which as i say be not really anything strategical since you just purchase the good ally and forget about the rest so for most of the time you will just have the game close collect money for you the progress be non existant as you can not really see any beside the small number indicate the level because the game be always the same random girl with a new random background every 10 level the bad thing about this game though be that you do not know where you be go on clicker hero you always have a clear objective which be not only to get further than your last ascension but it also give you some clear short mid long range objective to achieve and a little bonus if you manage to complete them which be the in game achievement you have a reason to go further and a clear objective and you also see an ending point to reach in this game you do not have any you just beat these always the same enemy for no reason at all forever reach further boss have no meaning either as they be simply another randomly dress girl which give you nothing more than some coin as all the other enemy i see it as if this game try to be another clicker with its own identity but this new identity fail to be attractive and do not even work right,neg

early access reviewthis be one of my favorite game i have decide to recently redownload it and find it have go the way of too many game the free to play coverup instead of get expierence from battle and then be able to trasnfer it into more part you get basic part and if you want anything else you be just straight out of luck i do not recommend this game in its current state,neg
1 the meta have not reach pendulum and the other thing lul the only reason why there be no auto win deck 2 fast pace no mp 2 be a bit strange but acceptable since we get fast pace match also 4000 lp make it even well 3 turn very simple turn base system love it 4 activation spell effect this be the main problem other will know what kind of spell trap we set since there be a bit delay when the enemy make an action the system will ask you if you want to active your trap etc5 f2p friendly at least they give free gem aside those pay2w structure deck,pos
fractured space be a game of giant spaceship stately and graceful motion and ruthlessly low ttk couple with strategic and defensive play that can go on for 30 m or more it be a remarkable example of how you can take the moba archetype as a starting point and end up at something that not only look totally different and play totally different but actually build on the good part of the genre many review for this game go into the strategic depth they be right the tactical depth they be right or the mechanical level of complexity they be mostly right the game play well for the most part and can easily support thousand of hour of play but i will not say much more on that i would like to point out the community management for fractured space be top notch the community manager know that have a coc and ban people base of it will draw a lot of fire on steam from troll but they have stick to their gun i have never see cms more proactive on ban racist transphobe homophobe and even misogynist it be incredible and you have to know it come at the cost of a lot of ill will from troll collective of steam even the game dev can get punish for bad behavior while it be rare to see them cross the line it have happen and the cms have not hand out special treatment they do this while still be tolerant of the normal outburst and rigorous debate we all expect in competitive gaming community you can disagree with a dev and call them out on it even in game or on the forum and they will listen they may not agree with you or act on what you say but for such a well police community the actual level of debate be very spirited that be something special and rare all on its own and ecg deserve a lot of credit for this it be a real accomplishment all on its own finally fractured space deep gameplay be not mar by monetization mechanic in general ecg know that people want to unlock their content and they collect money for cosmetic modification and booster much like any f2p game but there be no mechanical advantage afford as of 09 2016 from any store option it be a fair game with a lot of depth you can play it know that while enemy may be well than you or more coordinated than you they still have the same tool in their toolkit as you do and they have stick to their gun on that stance even though it have cause a lot of short term problem for them,pos

early access reviewupdate 1 year and 125 hour of gameplay later and this game have rise to my all time favorite list matchmaking now take significantly less time to find a round thank to a slowly but noticably expand player base new and awesome ship be be add on a very regular basis by the dev every month or so visual be even more beautiful and powerful than before a lot of recent review be rip on the new crew drop system but it be really not that bad it be just heavily focused on grinding but the dev be active and listen so i would not be surprised if we see suble tweak to this system in the come month i would like to also comment on a complaint i have hear a lot no this game be not pay to win lot of people be complain that the platinum currency be pay to win but all it be use for be exclusive ship skin that only change aesthetic now that this game have enter free to play you can pick it up and eventually own every ship and weapon available without spend a dime though you myself and most other have a significant grind to look forward to before such a goal can be achieve challenge accept now go play fractured space original review below only have the chance to play one round so far but from what i can tell i be really go to like this game there be definitely an initial learning curve since i do not get a single kill in that round and my team lose terribly but that be the most fun i have ever have lose the ship texture be beautiful the weapon be tacticle diverse and just awesome i would definitely recommend watch some youtube tutorial before jump straight into a game otherwise you may be a bit lost as there be no start tutorial at this time though dev say they be work on it my only complaint be some pretty severe albeit intermittent lag spike i have a network meter on my 2nd monitor and when my ship would freeze i would see the network connection tank would last about 5 10 second then when it regain connection my ship would snap across the map to where it have aparently be go die a couple time because of that not a problem with my network btw it handle all other online game include bf4 flawlessly i be hope that sort itself out through development or that i be just play on a bad server all in all this be a really fun game the sort of game i have be look for for a long time it be like battleship meet league of legends meet starwars i be really excited to see how this game progress as the dev work on it i would definitely recommend it,pos
ok so this game in all honesty seem decent i like it i like the weapon and item the fact that there s hundred of zombie near you and it will not lag you out the game overall be solid it just need work what i do not like be the community like always most people kill on sight so its really a scavenge and hide game there s no real suvival wich be also take away by the fact that you can just buy food and water and a ton of other item from get money get from kill zombie for a free game its alright i think they need to allow free server host and a singleplayer offline mode for people who do not have internet that much or have bad connection to server like me but until there s free server host or a singleplayer where i can actually have a survival experience i do not think ill be play it much i be only recommend this to support the game but i will not play it that much so if somewhat desperate for a zombie survival game then this game may entertain you for a bit its free so why not try it,pos

early access reviewi juste to love this game where i could spend time just build bot and see if they work or just make a funny looking bot for the fun of it now with the change to the looting system they add and in the prosses destoye the abillity to get the part you want robitts be a joke from rp if you want to make something now you have to cross your finger that you get what you need and for anyone that like to make new bot and be creative this be a prison of what this game use to be,neg
the basic idea of this game be great the graphic be good the only major problem be that this be not hunt i dot know anyone who go out with a gps helper to track stalk thier own kill this game make you depend on gadget rather than any sort of skill the pay system be not worth it i will be uninstalle in just a few,neg
despite all license buying which i do not mind at all this game be realistic have a good atmoshere its butiful and its a free game so there be obviously go to be micro transaction but i do not buy them but i still like the game and btw all the other review the pepole hwo rote them only have 0 5 h on record so what do they know i recomend to download this game i mean its free so why not,pos

early access reviewi buy this game thank to the sale want to understand why bless online be so hated and if it deserve it and yes it deserve it bad engine bad graphic bad optimization orrible animation no trace of action combat system and press very fast 1 r r r be not action and there be no dodge ui be some of the worst ever see auto run be bug and its pathfinding be very very unefficent a nice character customization npc be all edgy and bad charaterize story be without any trace of commitment by the developer combo system be a lie not a very combo system just a short action bar and more spell come out when you cast one of yours from your mini action bar thank to the combo system you can not have all the cooldowns within reach and skill system be not hard but it be unnecessarily complicated in pvp it be a competition to whom press faster his 1 r r combo the only credit that i can give to bless online be that now i can consider even metin2 a very good mmorpg,neg

i think it be a fun game unlike most free to play game this game do not feel like you be limit with a paywall and that i can not beat this level or game without pay also all the cash shop really do be sell costume and mount while yes the mount can be use in combat they be not overpower in any sense i have not pay for anything in this game and i find it to be a fun sidescrolling beat em up on the other hand the game can be a little repetitive for some item but overall it be fun,pos
1 it may be free but the developer really want you to purchase from the store there be no need to purchase anything if you like wait for a very long time later on in your vault if you actually want your store to entice purchase remove the way to speed up the time by change the clock it would make me hate your game more than now 2 some of the achievement though not many care about them shoehorn you into purchase lunch box to have a chance to receive a legendary character because achievement be part of the game i choose to rate it 3 quest be the bad part of this game they have extremely long wait time until you can actually do them the location be very repeatable and the enemy seem so stack as to prolong your time in the boring quest 99 of speech option do not change the outcome when in dialogue with an npc make them seem unimportant only upside of these be the fact that they be partly non linear you can make it to the end quickly or accidentally go the wrong way but your character will hint that anyways 4 the balancing for radiation need to be look at it be very easy to run your resource on a quest or in a vault because of radiation even with a full vault of maxe out character and level 17 endurance and room good weapon and armor deathclaw and radscorpion seem extremely unfair deathclaw seem to rip through any health your dweller have while radscorpion will rip through health and irradiate them make you waste double the resource and waste time micromanage the vault,neg

despite be my favorite game of the past year i still have to agree that planetside 2 have one of the most difficult learning curve to pass in a game for new player interested in try out this game i recommend expect to die more than kill initially however the sheer scale of combat make for an amazing display i remember when i first start play i join a battle span several territory huge line of tank be exchange fire as aircraft swoop through the chaos it be an amazing introduction to the game but not an uncommon one ps2 contain some of the most expansive strategic and intense fight i have experience in the fps genre progression through upgrade feel rewarding and there be no pay to win option for those who choose to spend money i personally recommend try to help your team before you start do hilariously insane thing like my outfit do overall there be hundred of way to play the game depend on what class loadout and customization you choose which evolve over time as you earn more item there will be time where you get tired of playing then immediately get back into the game because you have discover a new and effective way to fight conclusively i highly recommend this game to anyone who want an fps that they can enjoy for a very long time tl dr planetside 2 be an mmofps that both capture the massive scale of battle and give option to the micro scale of each individual player,pos

i have over 400 hour into this game and while i enjoy it i hate it at the same time allow me to explain the arpg genre be about get lot of loot kill lot of bad guy and feel like your character be progress into a powerhouse path of exile be the top of the line arpg for customization but it be a trick you see as you progress in the game you do not become strong but rather it seem weak because as you progress the game take your defense away from you force you to stack more and more which result in the feeling that you be fight the developer the game have fire lightning and cold elemental resistance all of which have a default cap of 75 this cap can be raise by specific piece of gear and very few skill tree node now as you progress half way through the story you lose 30 resist yes if you have no armor on at this point you be 30 to all of your resistance mean you take 30 more elemental damage as you beat the campaign and begin the real endgame you lose another 30 elemental resist in this game be immensely important and rare to find on gear especially unique legendary item so to even stand a chance of not be instantly kill against the weak of end game enemy not boss i be talk the stuff you should at this point be 1 shot you need a total of 135 resist to fire cold and lightning on your gear that be not to fight the final boss that be to fight the mob that you want to farm to get the gear to fight the final content thus fight the developer the game have a massive skill tree which look like insane customization but there really be not if you try to take a creative path and build a unique character you must follow certain path to get the defense you need in the form of increase life or energy shield pseudo life or you will die instantly in the end game content this immense defensive need greatly hinder the customization the skill tree would add i love the game potential but at this point fight the dev to even survive be mundane and quite frankily very frustrating if you be not willing to dump immense amount of time and stress into this game do not bother play past the first few act it become a job as oppose to a game i have try to enjoy this game because i love arpg but the defensive battle be simply not fun,neg

some reviewer here have justifiably complain about the need to pay real money to compete in high level pvp play and i be sure that be true although i play pretty much entirely pve i will let you know what i have find in my first few week of play almost nothing in the game can not be gain with enough time and effort there be mechanic that allow you to earn zen which be the in game currency you directly get from cash infusion from your bank account maximize these mechanic will take a great deal of time in and of itself and even once they be maximize a player would need to manage a lot of gameplay to earn the zen need to generate enough zen for an epic mount or companion for disclosure sake i will admit i have put about 60us into the game all in one primary character who be level all the way to 60 and have epic equipment i have 3 other character who be currently level up who have receive absolutely no financial help from the primary character nor have they receive any form of real world financial infusion and this be the important part those character be do absolutely fine in the pve world be a level 20 character with no money invest go to be as powerful as a same level character with 20 or 50 dollar in it no that do not mean the zero dollar character be unable to handle the foe he she meet in the pve game some hint if you want to play on the cheap 1 you can start use profession at level 10 or 11 use them in particular the leadership profession the leadership profession allow you to generate astral diamond the in game currency which can be convert to zen at a fairly good rate all the craft profession have at high level the ability to create item which can be auction for significant amount of astral diamond as well moreover the profession can easily be manage even when you be not play the game through a web browser check in a few time a day and progress your profession and the level should build relatively quickly hint 2 lockbox be for sucker sure they be one of the way to get an epic mount companion right now but they cost more in astral diamond than they generate on average key cost 125 or 112 5 if you buy ten at a time zen 1 25 or 1 13 usd to open them and usually only generate enough astral diamond to buy back between 60 90 of that hint 3 do not sink large quantity of ad into improve enchantment the cost power ratio you get decrease with each level of enchantment hint 4 epic mount be not really necessary nice sure need not for pve hint 5 sword coast adventure you can get epic companion with this online function hint 6 the foundry if you be creative you can generate adventure which can earn you epic mount companion and hint 7 try to get by with the good equipment you find in your adventure and use the auction house only when you really need something that be not for sale for silver gold every few level you will find equipment better than you could have possibly use before so save the ad for upgrade your companion mount and to perhaps buy an epic set of equipment for reference you need 1 550 000 ad to go from a common free companion up to an epic one through promotion or 1 250 000 to go from uncommon also relatively easy to get with no cash to epic if you have not be hoard them you will find the upgrade very expensive and you will also discover your companion decrease in usefulness when you do not upgrade them upgrade a mount be even more expensive if i would known these hint the 60usd character i have would have cost me maybe 30 and probably could have be do with a disciplined 20,pos
early access reviewvery well do mashup of magic and hearthstone without all the random element that make hearthstone so infuriate extremely generous with free card very easy to get a collection go without spend a dime the dev seem very intent on balance and patching op card combo quickly definitely check it out if you like digital card game at all,pos

early access reviewi get this game because i think it would be a fun little one off crap game to waste a couple minute on i be instead pleasently surprised to find a fairly flesh out combat system and a fun take on the br genre pro fun combat class fun and useful class specific ability fresh take on armor and weapon upgrade use forge mount for movement speed last but not least you turn into a chicken when you go down perhaps the game most interesting way that it set itself apart from other brs be that instead of die flat out even in a solo game you turn into a chicken when your health reach 0 and you get to hop around dip and dodge while your opponent try to end you be chicken life now for the conscon uninspired location on map bland art style control be sometimes clunky the loot system be hot garbage as the game stand as i write this you can open 9 chest in a row and get armor and ability instead of a weapon it can be fairly infuriating this game be in alpha and if the dev continue to improve this game it will find a fair amount of success 9 10 for a free alpha,pos
i do not undertand many of the review for this game yes it be not truly a free to play but to hunt everything in the game and get two new gun to do so there be a 15 dollar bundle come on people pay that much money for agame like counter strike and do not complain plus i love the people who say i run around the map for 20 hour when key word run have you ever run around the wood at full sprint and see an animal hmm gee i wonder why this be my all time favorite game and no joke i pay 15 buck i have i think 130 hour now and still have not have to pay again and even when i do have to renew my membership that s only 10 buck so 25 buck still be not bad when i have pay that for game that i have less than 10 hour in its really a ing amazing game but people do not give it a fair chance and for some reason think hunt animal be like play call of duty sprint around dive to floor spray and pray group of deer cry because noob wreck your my advice would be just go for the 15 dollar bundle and give this game at least a fair shot hell even if you hate the game 15 dollar be not go to kill you thank and enjoy the hunt,pos
early access reviewactual for v buildok i will try to summ up thing would not suggest it to anyone because of atrocious grinding and poor economy imbalance fps and rts part be almost break use to be a good game at closed beta but then dev team go full retard and way too greedy so in generally speak it be p2w at its fine some people may tell you that it be pay to skip grind but its just a half of the truth first of all because if you will try to grind for something decent to be on the same lvl with guy beat you like grind for weapon or badge it will take you day and even month for some stuff just one example to show you the atrociusness of grind as it stand it be now roughly 1706 hour of continuous biking to run through the physical training badge at a rate of roughly 1200 per hour i be sure someone have a more accurate value 71 day specifically bronze be 5 8 hour reasonable silver be 105 hour or 4 5 day that be pretty ridiculous if you buy stuff with gold you can get machinegun or heavy tank instantly enough say some people may say but you still have to grind ribbon to modify your weapon like make an ohk rifle yup but with gold you can boost your progress like x2 or something like that and it still take an f2p player month to get something decent remember my example moreover you have to maintean your weapon and most likely you will go broke with most of weapon but if someone buy gold or premium he will be able to keep his weapon which for example can oneshot people but your gun need 2 shot to kill anyone this pretty sum up the game the game could be good bf clone for poor people but instead of it it try to squeeze all your money like an angry mobster moreover the game have be beta for year and with such atrocious grind and price it be obvious that dev use beta as a lame excuse to avoid responsibility for rts i will just give you this link bareable for free till you reach lvl3 but i would not suggest anyone ever spend even a penny into this one just buy yourself bf or gta v,neg
early access reviewestimate time to go prone 9 minutesestimated time to get a vehicle lol pay moneyestimated time to get that sniper rifle you want lol dedicate your entire life play this game,neg
early access reviewthis game have really funny content for those who like to read what the dev come up with for the interaction with npc there be also a lot of room for growth and for an open beta it have enough content to keep you busy for a while overall the community be pretty friendly and willing to help when you ask politely i look forward to see how this game will develop overtime and come out of beta i be especially excited for the new class that the dev will include i would recommend this game for player that have play other aq game before aq really take a giant leap with make this a cross platform game,pos
7 0 be the bad update ever make to a game all version before this be like a piece of art the game use to be ingenious require real skill and understanding of how different role between carry and support accomplish victory now the game be a cartoony arcade the hud be horrible the color of the game be too vibrant almost cartoonish the flow be too fast it be essentially an arcade game for kid i could get use to new change but when you mess the interface that much and i have to squint to see everything and i get a headache after not go to happen rip dota thank valve,neg
early access reviewbetter than be boredimo need much more spell that can interact a k a removal and control spell especially in the starter poolalso have trouble find see card draw also the color pie be all over the place red be still red burn and explode blue be a some kind of stall as in spray water and ice in your face green be the color of protect your stuff i think topaz be some obscure jack of all trade mess with a slight focus on stall and big monster nvm it be super op black be i think still black it have a few sacrifice trigger and some removal spell so far huuuuuuuuge note after some more playing topaz look to be objectively the strong color why it can gain life alot of life gain buff gain those life gain massive buff from play mana card aka power card which normally would be dead draw for other deck late game they can draw card and they have acce to both many small creature and extremely large creature on top of this they can remove ability and bounce back to hand your creature topaz only lack actual removal but that do not matter as other color their creature be weak and their ability get removedand they lack speed which do not matter because lifegain and more lifegainit also lack deal with weapon and equipable but that also do not matter because equipable and weapon be a tiny and weak mechanic and topaz just put out creature so big your 6 6 weapon barely matter anywaysnow i have think about the option that the game be like ey jevry you keep play buffy token huh well screw you here be your cryptonite for a second but then think twice and realise topaz simply have too many power and acce to stuff why be this a problem this be a problem because it ensure consistensy for toppaz i could imitate the effect by combine all other 4 color into one deck but that mean i need mana of each type and while i struggle get stick with manatype a and c and cardtype b and dtopaaz can just play all the card it want whenever it want which stack even more upon the problem i would say move lifegain to the justice color as that actually make sense atm this however be just bs,neg
edit 16 07 17once we put in enough time we be able to set up a squad where most of us could play together again it be purely trial and error that get us there and be not explain in any detail we could find in the game if play solo the game be still exceptional in a pair its even better try to play with 3 or more people together get very tricky though as you need to spend squad point on either make your squad large a big group of friend or to add auxillery slot which be the slot that give you the option to change from an infantryman to a sniper or tanker etc etc mid battle its a case of either make your squad big enough to have all of your friend together but have no aux seat no variety or keep the aux seat ability to change role ingame but not be able to create a group big enough for all of your friend the old system be well imo if you have a sniper and the battle have sniper resource you could just switch to it then to pilot then tanker whatever the map have you could spawn as provide you own the type you want to switch to currently you need to setup your option before the battle start which lock you and your squadmate to just those soldier type as a consequence i barely ever us my pilot or para now as i do not like to give up my sniper tanker infantry slot original review smell the update rage lol love the game right up to the late squad update devyatayev have 566 9 hour on record and i love it right up until they break it with too many big change too suddenly with little explaination on how they work exactly what they have change and what they be try to encourage us to do with those change feel similar to how i feel go from windows 7 to window 8 if you know what i mean would love to roll back to the previous version where the game make sense do not force you to play only one role in a give battle and do not insist you take order from the random squad leader the game just pair you with previously you could begin as a paratrooper and drop in on a base for a cheeky capture switch to a pilot to protect the para plane and bomb the tank change to sniper to pick off some baddie then over to tanker to hold the bridge etc all in one match now you can not do any of that until you level up new badge by follow squad order give to you by someone you do not know and very frequently do not have a clue which order to give and even once you have the badge you can maybe attach a single infantryman to your tank squad but if play with friend only one of you can switch to infantry at a time it just remove all the versitility from the game and as i have at least one of each unit type i kinda enjoy be able to change to what be need at any give moment as it make me feel like i could affect the outcome of the battle rather than be stick as a whatever i turn up as would be a 5 star review 2 week ago now its a big fat 1 and that s be pretty generous just to give a bit of background there be 5 of us irl friend who all play together and since the update its not be possible for us all to play together in the same battle because of the new squad limitation its just break or they have not explain the change very well and i be completely in the dark about what i be miss,neg

aside from the baphomet symbol and sun symbol on the dice ad the game be pretty much pay2win where you fork over money to buy dice that give you great chance to roll those win number in which case multiplayer session will be brutal even those session where you choose no gadget do not mean they will not be use the special dice plenty of time i be so close to win only to be devasate at the last few moment of gameplay just garbage with satanic overture when you run out of token no way to play anymore session unless you fork over money or wait till the next day for a lucky handout if anything at all,neg

early access review my first tryhard review because this game deserve it firstly i be a hardcore game hopper because i find flaw fast that drive me away from the game a lot of game to date push out a title that be there just to make quick money and lack creativity replayability and polished gameplay mechanic there be also those game that go so hard into realism that it make a game overwhelming and tedious luckily for those interested in a new battle royal this be not the case off the start i be amazed by the character customization it be so innovated and gorgeous follow by the music track in the background be outstanding it actually pump you up let get down to the brass tax prosgraphicscreativitymusiccustomizationsmooth gameplayshoote down someone that be try to escape when there be plenty of seat on the chopper to evacuate the remain player the evacuation mechanic itself be really an awesome ending to the match not just winner winner chicken dinner its call try nubg it be not overly complex and the attachment auto install be super nice and smoothwhen prone and this be a goodin your character actually swivel his her body in order to do a 360 and turn on their in order to face 180 tired of get that ankle catch on a twig in nubg here be the solution snowboarding hang glide mountain climbing choose a spawn location before the match not just jump out of a plane with someones testical on top of your head as you land weekly and daily task challengessmoother than any br out there to date which be sad for this game be so new great job dev a true free to playconsthere be graphical detial that still need to be polish such as the structure i e door lack of graphical customization in setting will hinder amount of player able to play the game with potatoe pc still be develop so bug be eventually go to work themselves to the surface bind to happen people be still play fartnite and nubg and not this yetlookout br genre we have find an instant crowd favorite just hope the dev keep up with this amazing title r i p fartnite and nubg download this game and enjoy,pos

better not to start as you will not be able to quit none of my friend understand why this game be open in my account almost constantly and it be not possible to explain with mere word if you be a perfectionist and materially obsessed person this game could be bad to you than a night in the casino to an gambling addict,pos
believe it or not i have actually be enjoy this game now hear me out maybe it be because i love the httyd franchise maybe it be because i love have my own dragon to raise maybe it be because puberty treat hiccup well however i find the game to be colourful and frankly a breath of fresh air the graphic be outdated and similar to ps2 graphic it be glitchy and i have lose my dragon several time just walk around however this game have many more glitch before i start play it apparently consider i be able to input my appropriate age and i only crash once what we must keep in mind be this game just come out yesterday understandably who would want to put a glitchy unfinished product on the market cough ubisoft cough but that be the beauty of mmo although sometimes glitchy at first they develop and grow over time with the right support i think this game have a lot of potential and i be willing to stick around for it the cutscene be nothing to ogle at and they play scene from the movie for some of the quest i have do so far call me blind by nostalgia but throw movie scene into a computer game take me back to the old disney pc game of course it show laziness on development part by not create these cutscene themselves but i can still appreciate put scene in from the movie tl dr version i like this game while it have it be flaw i think it have potential 10 10 would have toothless follow my cursor in the lab again,pos
this game be like any other clicker game just as addict too i recommend it because it be the type of game that give a very high spike in that good feel quite often whilst play it and i believe more than just me or the people that have this game already should experience,pos
fun and good value game for fan of a casual fallout experience for those who do not mind a bit of a grind there be still enough role play element to customize their own experience,pos
early access reviewtl dr version there be immense fun to be have as long as you be willing to learn a thing or two prior to play bear in mind this be alpha stage so no proper tutorial be present aside from the community with that say i jump in learn from there it be successful absolutely recommend the title even now in alpha community tend to be more mature and helpful than in your average moba title too load of spaceship available with more to come and current one to be balance further each with their own role in the game dev hold weekly hangout on twitch where they answer question re development of the game which be also quite cool,pos

grinding be extreme in war thunder and a huge chore for f2p player this force you to go for premium but even then it take way too long to unlock something new unfortunately the matchmaking be break too you be fight against enemy with plane tank one tier higher than your make the grind even more frustrating do not be fool by gaijin,neg
i remember when i first play this game and the new character be the trap then we get 2 more the pvp need a lot of work put inot it becasue i keep gettte match with people that be around level 50 or 45 when i be lv20 and it be not fair this be pretty much the only bad thing i remembe rfrom this game it have an interesting world and some cool character,pos

great strategy game i have almost 400 hour on it it share similarity with civ 5 mtg and faeria definantly check it out it be free to play in reality if you spend 2 to 5 a month i feel it move thing a little faster not a must,pos
mostly like hearthstone but they bring in an interrupt instant mechanic which slow stuff down immensely and require everyone to always pay attention when it be not their turn avoid that at all cost no matter how difficult it be to keep the game deep be perhaps the genius masterstroke of hearthstone and it be completely baffling that legend would try to turn back the clock on that normally this would not be so much of a dealbreaker but legend be so similar to hearthstone in design that it force comparison and must necessarily beat hearthstone at its own game which it do not,neg
this be a game that require you to smite stuff in the face over and over lot of smite in smite smite this face and you smite that face you smite here and you smite there it be smite,pos
it be fun it get some point but it be a clearly example for an unbalanced game to earn i be not ask for a everything free just take a look at dota 2 it be a true f2p game of course a lot of pp pay thousand dollar for dota 2 but none of them can win the game by pay money i do not get it the mole rat which can use kage bushino jutsu and amaterasu while human which can stand and stare back to those mole rat with the gun in hand the armor on body,neg
early access reviewthe game be so much well when i first play like three year ago now i have a 5 minute ban because of the new beta i bet they rush to get release i could not connect to a damn game because someone keep get disconnected and when we do get disconnected we get a game abondon cool down i literally have the whole thing record from try to join a game to get kick and ban,neg

i be really dissappointed in this game i be really hope it would work even after read all the bad review i be still give it the benefit of the doubt the graphic look nice and i the idea of a group vs group and a 100 vs 100 mode seem super fun so i download the game and start customize my character and be have a lot of fun because the customization menu be v detail after make my character i continue to the main basic training part of the game and i just find the instruction so frusterating and difficult the main movement control be fine and easy but the control to fight and use power up be just too annoying for me to try and figure out i think it would have be well if you could just use the right and leave click of your mouse and maybe scroll through the different power up to use in battle i be really root for this game to work for me but it just do not if anyone read this review have tip to make the gameplay more easy and fun please let me know,neg
i love the game i really do and i play it year before i ever switch to use it on steam and that be only about a month ago despite the large number of hour list however i can not recommend it anymore why they have go out of their way to destroy the game especially of late they seem to be actively work to drive away the player and in the last month alone it be work spectacularly in january they have something like 15 000 player through steam now they have something like 3 500 ignore the stuff everyone else be complain about though justified like the lag and disconnect they have recently destroy a player ability to earn astral diamond the primary currency in the game yet do nothing to adjust the price of everything that require them make the only way to get enough of them to even get by be to pay cash and with the rate the player be flee the game you get less and less diamond for the same amount of money give it be a player base exchange similar to what gw2 have without an adequate supply of astral diamond there be basically no character progression at high level i wish i could keep play but not be able to get and stay connected to the game for day at a time with lag that will guarantee many dungeon wipe in a row even with the good of player it be just too frustrating even with all the extra character slot i buy to try to have extra character with which to farm diamond just to try and have enough diamond to support one character it do me no good when the lag make the game virtually unplayable truly disappointing to see such a great game be destroy while the dev turn a blind eye stick their finger in their ear and keep scream i can not hear you the game be perfect i can not hear you we have never make a bad decision ever,neg
get to say it be a pretty good and little adicktive game great for a quick play or long session 1 thing i have notice since use a ultra wide 2560 x 1080 be to try and aviod zoomie out too far and then move the map it tend to freak out and dissappear it will come back when you zoom back in,pos

okay here we go boy i think lol have ing balance issue lmao boy be i wrong just wait until you lose to a ing fetus who do not stop laugh taunt because he win with anubis in a single lane game mode i guarantee that you will blow your load all over your monitor because of all the pleasure you get from that hi rez should we balance the character so that the people who want to play character they like can win the game as well nah that let just keep add skin for our male character that make edge lord say oh this thanatos skin fit me as a person cause i also like death and the color black and the female character get e stripper cloth so this community of ing virgin can blow their load to the token jail bait in this game aka jing wei i have play hundred of video game in my life and i have never meet a more toxic or entitled ing community and i have play lol csgo gta 5 and ing dota 2 i would rather get a with tooth than get in another lobby of smite of wait that fenrir skin be kinda dope never mind i already buy it,neg
this game seem like a poor platformer compare to other game like smash brother to metroid to even dust it have a dedicated comunity and content still be add on and it cost money i have make it far without pay a dime but there be clear and anoying ploy to get you to spend cash however it be dungeon be interesting but too linear this be not a game about explore and in pvp there be a high skill climb if you be not use to the genre or fail to understand how to get out of a stunlock but there be plenty of guild out there who would be willing to help you learn how to survive the pvp,pos
early access reviewthis game be great for people who want a true f2p experience play around 10 hour now and i have get so many card and booster pack not to mention each booster pack give you a resource that you can use to craft card with as well as 12 card very friendly towards people who want to play against ai as well overall i would definitely recommend this game,pos
great game it can definitely get pretty challenging at time and you need to be strategic with the layout of your vault but the big your vault get the more fun it will be because that be when you can start do more quest train your dweller special stat and craft weapon armor and theme overall a great and addicting game would recommend ps i have see some people complain about the microtransaction but the truth be you do not even need to spend a single penny to have a good vault my vault have 100 dweller and i have not buy anything,pos
recommend this game however a low end pc will not be able to run it at a decent framerate 30fps run it on a laptop i get 30fps low setting so optimization be actually improve they be still work on that bad graphic card in existence terrible processor yet it run my mother computer be bad off yet it run 20fps a while back,pos
do not play this game for any reason its one big cash grab and full of fustration for no reason at all crap match make crap balance sub par graphic lazy dev i use to suggest this game to my friend but honestly this game deserve to die and quickly,neg
wargame why the hell would you put this on steam and not regular wot on a side note it be a great game primarily aim to those who can not run the original game graphic be nice for be a mobile port and there be alot of variation in tank wargame certainly hit the spot on this one my only complain be the yolo it player they most certainly ed alot of the match i take part in fun fast match with good look tank and you can team up with a friend against those bastard what else would you want,pos
i think that i would love the game but the tutorial for learn the aircraft be absolutely horrendous bad tutorial i get fc3 and be try to learn to fly the su 27 1 the guy talk so quietly lot of background noise 2 the text for the guy script have very tiny print 3 the text will disappear and there be no listing of what to do if i do not finish read the text 4 not all of the control be list in the lesson description 5 there should be a whole document in game book describe every detail teach in the lesson that should be available to be read outside of fly the plane in the lesson have large print if you do that 6 i start play the game again on oct 12 and everything be very blue i set up the mission to be very cloudy and have some fog but everything be soooo blue all of the cloudy sky and thick fog be blue like kool aid other idea 1 i wish there be lot more map available in the game and sell cheap i want a map with a massive flat desert and that could be sell at a maximum of 10 or free i do not want map that be base on real place 2 when i press esc i want to have a whole mission restart from the very beginning available right there so i can quickly go back after a mistake 3 female pilot model and voice would be a nice option for those like me who want them in the game,neg
early access reviewi have never play minecraft before but when my wife pick up this game during it be free week i decide i would check it out as well it be absolutely fantastic i play it for about a day and a half before i decide to pay for it and i do not even slightly regret the choice it be still early access and it occasionally show but this game show an extremely high level of polish that i have not see on some game that be even fully release the bug that i have come across be usually small but pretty regularly re creatable however the depth and breadth of the game make them easy to overlook my big problem be with the combat honestly it be almost always a battle of attrition and if you survive you tend to end up with low health at that point it be almost well to just kill yourself somehow and run and get your thing die be basically a part of the game so it be good that there be no real repercussion for do so other than have to go pick up the thing in your bag some creature be absurdly difficult and dodge be almost a complete non factor you can occasionally find a good spot to dance a circle around a creature and not get hit but it be inconsisitent my 2nd large issue be the durability of some item in the game compare to the amount of material require to craft them the mining cell in particular come to mind there be one of two way to solve this as far as i can see either make item with durability like mining cell last a lot longer or make the odd material to make them more readily available i be not say i want my stone mining cell to last me through 18 hour of playtime but i would like to be able to find 5 red flower without run around for 20 minute look at every other tree i find in spite of this the game be immensely fun and you can easily find yourself suck into it dig into your mine deeper craft your house to look absurdly awesome or just explore the surprisingly vast environment you will find yourself readily wonder where the hour have go i would definitely give this game a 9 10 because it be technically not even finish yet you should definitely check it out,pos
mediocre yu gi oh game clunky user interface rule be a bit different than the original i recall deck field be much small way too many currency and token in game play well verison on gba,neg

i play this game for a bit a long way back it be pretty good but i do not really get into it fall of oriath come around and i figure what the hell let give it another go wow after play through a hardcore character in d3 and then get to 90 in hardcore harbinger with a tanky sunder raider i be hook and make 6 more build within a month the passive tree look scary but look up a couple people who be do well use poebuild io want to trade poe trade want a map of the labyrinth for the day poelab com there be ton of amazing guide out there to help make what seem like a game that s a heavy pick up feel effortless atlas of world come out and with it the abyss league and me and my friend be all have fun run through again amazing game great dev team pay for cosmetic and extra item storage only get it you will not regret it if you like arpg,pos
this game be great in my opinion most people complain about the dnd rule be break but who really care i just want a decent mmo that dosnt have you sit there attack monster for once they attack you also its a interactive combat system meaning you sit there you dodge strike dodge and strike again,pos
early access reviewi love this game it totally scratch the itch that eve leave out dynamic 3d space battle between capital ship that somewhat like lol in a sense what i love about it 1 easy to pick up the game be not hard to understand and provide tutorial as well as a shooting range map for you to test your ship weapon etc 2 graphic enough say 3 developer that actually listen and read player suggestion and comment 4 pace research speed not as demand as wt or wot but not easy enough fo ryou to breeze through the game in no time 5 the game look like its ready to roll out of beta but still have the development support of a alpha game this mean that change will happen and patch update will still be frequent lot of uncharted space to roam through still the down side 1 slightly long wait time for match 2 not much teamwork go on at time but that be on the playerbase and not on the game or its developer note about the mixed review notice most of the negative review be either player who have buy this pre ftp alpha and demand refund or player with few hour on the game i have this on my 2nd account and have 100 hour on it i believe that this be a issue between the consumer and the developer and should not be use as ground to judge the game itself you make the choice to support this game this game take off in a different direction but it should not be surprising that it may go ftp to gain more playerbase,pos
random lazy review sp this game may be inspire heavily by diablo 2 but present a pinnacle of greatness out of itself one hand easy to play isometric hack and slash worldwide standard main storyline mission be decent enough every single game mechanic be perfect to the extreme huge skill tree interesting gem property result in brilliant active skill artistic graphical side and variety of character enemy landscape etc be a sight for sore eyessome of minor issue for me which have no effect on the value fo the game where be the pause button respawne of monster in a particular map whenever you be disconnect or hit esc to get a coffee you have to go through everytime too much unecessary loot little bug drop heavy armour countless of weapon which make no sense a common problem with diablo genre bottomline evil blizzard bad nightmare recommend play it now,pos
this be a very serious confession and yes i regret every part of it i spend over 1000 on this game last year on console i regret it every day do not get this not now not tomorrow not next week not after an update not when it die never for the love of mara do not get this,neg

early access reviewthis game be in its early stage of development it be an awesome tem base game give this game a chance it will only get well its a game you have to work your way to get ship and equipment there be many different ship to choose from and they be unique in their own way many of the ship be mission dependent if you work as a team you succeed more than individually strategy and tactic be the key to win,pos
i plan to write more review but they will be short enough for all to read but just enough infoa 100 free to play game that have more depth more content and much to do than most game you would shell out money for it be like diablo 3 but dark and a more gritty feel story you be exile and leave in a continent or place call wraeclast you venture out in dungeon cave ruin jungle and other locale in wraeclast gameplay you select various class maurauder melee tank duelist hybrid of melee range ranger archer witch mage templar hybrid and a scion unlock after 1st act so there be a character for just about any play style destroy the many horde of creature in wraeclast to gain experience and level up you get nice loot base on the enemy you kill or quest you complete you get to use special colored component to enhance your weapon and gear and poe boast a massive skill tree that i have ever see in game the skill tree be like an extension to the colored component but you can specifically add point to certain attribute online co op there be some co op play but keep in mind you have to be close in level with other player there be guild to join you can trade some of your gear with other player there be also pvp and often time tournament you can qualify for to make the game challenge con minor gripe be for some not so good netcoding you think your character be at one point on a level but a split millisecond his her position be somewhere else as if he teleport it can get confuse sometimes frustrating when deal with a mob of enemy but it be a minor gripe conclusion if you like diablo game give this a try game have a bit of a learning curve to it but there be plenty of guide and helpful people that can get you start or keep you move on there be plenty to do the game today be completely different from when it be first available most importantly the game be free the only time money would be spend be for purely cosmetic enhancement to your character this be the first game i ever put over 100 hour into on steam and it be worth it,pos
early access reviewthe game have a nice space moba concept really enjoy this game so far it desperately need more map and more targeting option aka target system and such some minor latency issue nothing too serious 5v5 be a nice start but i can see this game be epic with large scale battle as well graphic be on par ship be realisitically design hud minimap need improvement the game do require communication and a good sense of tactic once your mmr have go up a bit base race with my 1 collossus vs 3 of their ship in our base win 100 99 10 10ghost stealth behind asteroid pop out and flank for a fast kill klingon stlye 10 10disperser push ship out of delta cap zone for the buff capture 10 10i hope they add a lot more to this game currently feel like a mode in a big game i believe they can even make a campaign with this engine,pos
it can have some very frustrating down over time but this game continue to show growth and excellent gameplay that i have always want it can be very intimidating with the learning curve and the late part of the game will quickly punish any build not up to snuff because of such i do recommend read build guide that help explain how and why thing work as they do go in completely blind do not always teach a person if they do not know what it be that they be do wrong year in and it be still get massive content update for free to all of the player make it worth support them with a supporter pack and use the point for stash tab to make the gameplay a bit more for us hoarder also help with keep your valuable item and currency in check just make sure to wait for a stash tab sale that they always have at least once a month never buy an item that be not on sale with the mtx store i love the game but the mtx can be very pricey once you convert the price to point ratio and find out that a hat cost you ten dollar good to just buy supporter pack for what they offer to support league you want to promote or set you want to collect and use the leftover point for stash tab and stuff on sale when you think you have enough,pos
early access reviewthis card game have so many land inbalance its a joke i play magic the gathing grow up with the same land to card ratio and never have so many land inbalance and its not look like there plane to fix this at this point i be sick of lose purely from draw no land or 10 stright turn of just land game remove and i will not recommend this game to other,neg

the game premise be compelling but you will spend most of your time in this game run through empty room with nothing inside them break up by the occasional monster chase all of which fail to excite past the initial encounter after you discover their gimmick or environmental nudge nudge video game reference the story be a disconnected mishmash of popular horror trope that do not make any kind of last impression on me i be glad i try it but it be definitely not worth play through to the end where i be meet with an unsatisfying conclusion to the story the alternate ending be not much well,neg
i be not really a fps guyi think i may try this out since it be free to play well at least i try pro graphic be good it be free nice map really really bigcon not much costumization walk run way too slow no way of aim no crosshair in my little hour of play the different mode i see no other player at all crash a lot i do not know if i will play this game much but at least i get it in my library now,pos
early access reviewnice little f2p fps black squad be essentially combat arm without the ridiculous limit on purchase weapon as almost all item in the store be permanent and relatively easily acquire the game reward you with the secondary currency fairly frequently namely after daily challenge level up and daily login reward which allow you to buy the more exclusive weapon in other word some of the more powerful weapon daily login reward do not require you to hop on every day to track so the game do not force you to log on every day to recieve the reward pro great fun for a simple multiplayer fps several game mode many map large selection of weapon to choose from do not force you to spend money to get good gear play fluidly and feel great to play overall most weapon be balance fairly for example the m107 be one shoot one kill but you can not move with it because if you do the bullet will be send into the ceiling or the floor con poor map design be very easy to be spawn camp on certain side of certain map you can not change loadout once you have pick one and spawn slight p2w element though they be not nearly as present as most other game balance can be a little iffy at time some weapon be insanely accurate for instancegive it a go if you want simple multiplayer fps fun i be have an absolute blast with black squad edit you can change loadout after spawn you just need to use f1 f3,pos

very confusing for a new player to deal with when you install do not run it watch a tutorial or two first my personal tip always join a squadthrow a sunderer transport vehicle where squadmate can spawn near a contest pointdont try to run a base solo unless you be absolutely sure it be empty have a friend or two to have some laugh with example below example for the above tip base on a true story me and my brother both get into the game and we quickly think of a weird strategy take a valkyrie a 2 seat helicopter fly over an enemy basemake sure one of you be light assaultthe light assault jump outjetpack down to the groundthe valkyrie have to land at a determined locationlight assault run in and try to capture the baseif the enemy begin to chase the light assault he run to the valkyrie and both player take offtry with another baserepeat until successful tl dr watch a tutorial or two czu its confusing for new player otherwise its a good game,pos
early access reviewnot recommendedthe game do not offer absolutely anything from what promise the server be unstable the graphic be very old but this work can be an advantage server be unstable the game have a lot of bug and have no pve content at all do not buy this game now maybe after some time when they polish all can give a try a short try,neg
wife be away for a few day 45 hour into thehunter in 3 5 day first look tl dr i can only hunt 2 thing unless i get a subscription that noise put some effort into it and click a couple thing that be not how it be for more info read the first section on what be really up the real tl dr it be a hunting sim if you like hunt nature and an experience that directly reward you for the effort you put into it give this a try it be supprisingly addicting fun and reward my impression of the economy in the game and possible solution for you thrifty spender who do not want a subscription this game be not what i would classify as f2p the game you can download for free be basicly a demo that still allow you to interact with other people online and experience a good scope of the game you only have license for mule deer and cottontail rabbit you will not be allow to shoot the bunnehs with the rifle they supply you with though even if you do not invest a single penny into this game though i prolly spend a good 20 hour hunt mule deer with that free rifle alone so why not give it a try you have unlimited ammo for that rifle want to hunt the bunnehs too for one single for all time investment of 5 usd from henceforth all money i list will be in usd for you gbp euro and other user you can get 500em of the game currency you can get a shotgun for 450em while ammo for the shotgun will not be free like the ammo for the rifle you can still get the ammo for free for some time just from play accomplish mission read task will earn you gm which can be spend on various consumable in the game like ammo em be the premium currency you have to buy with money gm be the currency you can earn from complete mission in the game like take down a 6 point buck em can purchase anything while gm can only buy ammo wind indicator scent eliminator consumable as a guest free player you can still visit and explore every map on the game and play with other people however mule deer can only be find on logger point and whiteheart island the cottontail rabbit can be find elsewhere though you can earn em from participate in our sponser activity i gather that be a lot of survey and email you can direct to a junk email account not worth it imo but that option be there if you want to earn premium currency without spend money the wayfarer starter pack be 14 99 it come with various item but most importantly weapon it give you a 3 month license which provide you with licence for all animal in the game and unlimited ammo for all gun it say basic ammo but the only non basic ammo there be be the tracer arrow it also give you a shotgun and a 357 pistol you now have the ability and weapon to hunt everything in the game 15 for 3 month most mmos cost that for a single month it get even well than that it be actually only 9 99 for a 3 month membership that be 3 33 for 30 day that sound pretty cheap to me but i do completely understand not want to pay for it at all so read on for way to work around that do not want to pay for a sub not a problem you can actually buy licence for individual animal for pretty cheap say you can only really play on saturday with your friend you can pick up a 24 hour license for any animal for 45em that be 45 cent if you buy the cheap money pack the large bundle be well value 4 99 for 500 9 69 1000 18 69 2000 26 99 3000 43 99 5000 so say you get 2000 for 18 69 be honest with yourself you have spend more on crappi game it be like the same price as a craptastic meal for you and your sweetie at taco bell you now have 2000em and a 24 hour license be only 45 that be almost a year of saturdays worth of game with your friend you can get a 7 day license for 95 you can even buy license with gm which be the money you can earn in game you can now take your free rifle with unlimited ammo and go hunt other animal my actuall review i think it be a great game i do think it be be market poorly it really be not what i consider a f2p game like they be try to list it as a lot of people include myself see that it be restrict and require money to fully unlock the game and say bs i be out of here read the above it be cheap than most game you prolly play this be a sim this be not doom or any other shooter running be this game will only assure you that you never have a chance to shoot at anything if you even see anything slow and steady win the race or slow be smooth smooth be fast or enter your choice here it be all about the hunt i spend most of my time track and stalk my prey just to line up a single shot they do well to make the tracking not be tedious and there be always the suspense of not really know if your prey be on the other side of the valley or around those tree the envrioment be amaze the tree look and move like tree even the bark look like bark and hold up to close examination the lighting be superb the way the sun filter through the tree and the sunrise be beautiful i have find myself just wander through the massivly large expanse of the map just enjoy the view it be the close you can come to experence nature without get off your lazy rump check some of my screenshot or any of the other people take it be a beautiful game there be character progression it be not an in your face tech tree your ability increase as you play as you track an animal your ability to track that type of animal become great and easy as you fire your weapon you progressivly get well at handle that weapon there be a decent variety of weapon rifle take your pick like the surgical precission accuracy of the 300 the hard hit power of the 9 3x62 anshuitz maybe something vintage like the famous k98 from all your ww2 shooter perhaps even more old school like a 50 caliber muzzle loader there be many to choose from shotgun shotgun your thing dig in extremly versitile with your choice of slug buck or bird shot they let you hunt every animal in the game with a single weapon come in a variety of style for your need pump action over under double barrel single shot or the semi auto 20 gauge to paint the field red with pheasent blood pistol everything from the 22 for varmint hunting to the 357 308 44 up to the 454 rage bull bow yep have them too popular compund bow with high tech auto select range finder sight precision readiness of the crossbow classic styling of the recurve then there be the classic true hunting experience of the longbow all the equipment and supply you can think of and would want for your style of hunt tent blind stand tower bait decoy scent eliminator lure the also have numerous style of camo and outfit for your practicle or stylish need 20 different animal to hunt twenty small and ellusive like the rabbit and fox king of the forrest like the moose and bear high climbing antic of the ipex the petite roe deer up to the massive red and reindeer even grind locked and airborn bird like turkie and goose the game market be compartmentalize you invest as little or as much as you want into it at 9 99 for 3 month it be one of the cheap subscription around and if you start play less just pick up a small pack of em and only pay for the day you want to play at 13 45 cent per day try it for yourself download the game for free head into logger point and start hunt mule deer the community for the most part be very friendly and willing to help new player learn the game this be suprisingly awesome,pos
fun game i would not exactly call it free because you can get and do so much more if you spend money on this game unlock special character pet weapon the work and it will also benefit you more it can become hard to make a decent amount of cap to upgrade and build new room i love that you can have pet but once again if you do not spend a certain amount of money do not get too excited when it come to have a nice collection of pet the dweller be easy to gather as you can impregnate female dweller with male dweller this will require more food and if you have a large base your energy will run out very quickly unless you play every 5 minute it be also extremely hard to get lunch box but very easy to send a dweller to the wasteland to get more weapon and outfit i like the game i just wish they would make it easy to get more cap and lunch box perhaps throw in a pet carrier when you log in every day for a whole week or so i would definitely recommend this game though i guess they have to earn money somehow updatei just go on my first quest and earn a lunch box i be still a newbie so bear with me day 7 of play this game or something and i earn a lunch box after my 7 day consecutive log in xd,pos

early access reviewoverall this be a really fun free to play shooter with earnable cosmetic weapon also you should not believe these review with 2 hour or less of play time claim there be rampant hacking in this game there be not there be really good player in this game for sure but if you do not play first person shooter go 2 0 22 a game and spray at people foot with an smg at 40 yrd away then you should not assume someone be cheat because they headshotte you 8 10 give it a shot if you be a fan of other shooter and want to try something familiar but with its own charm pro free to play start weapon be plenty viable and you can earn the rest of them fairly quickly map be build in a way so you do not have to roam around forever to find an enemy gunplay feel responsive and rewarding headshot accuracy matter con map be fairly small so this can lead to grenade spam in tdm however grenade themselves do not have ridiculous explosive radius and the further away you be the less damage it will do teambalance can sometimes stack you against really good player while leave you with not so good player to carry,pos

early access reviewi be recommend this game by a friend that really enjoy a number of similar game and i have be love it every since i first try it there be some cool mechanic that i think can only really be do in electronic card game or at the very least would be a pain to manage in paper game and there be not really any randomness unlike what i have experience with other game though you can purchase card with real money i have never feel the need to as the reward system be extremely generous you earn a free pack for your first win daily there be lot of objective that will give you a pack or two upon completion etc lastly it be quick to learn the introductory campaign cover a lot and there be a solid single player puzzle section that allow you to understand the in and out of different mechanic overall i highly recommend this game i enjoy it every time i play and it be really easy to get into with no starting experience,pos
it be hard not to compare this to magic the gathering say that this be actually well than mtg i especially like the system they use for add magika to your pool i have not do any duel against real opponent yet so i may alter my review in the future but for now the single player quest line be very fun i create a green white deck that be name monk i wonder if all green white deck be auto name this and i will say it be extremly effective my only complaint be that i dislike the random event that happen in some chapter thing like be in a bar fight you can get hit with random bottle or in the arena there be random item to help you even though these random occurrence may give it a more elder scroll feel it give it less of a strategy card game feel be that this be a strategy card game i think we have could have do without those the other complaint and i see this come so it be no suprise you can use real money to buy card make this yet another long line of pay to win game out there for this reason i be hesitant on player vs player mode,pos
early access reviewthis game be a clear carbon copy of csgo it play almost exactly the same the way you get weapon be exactly the same and the game be exactly the same the only reason why you should get this game be if you can not afford csgo but i mean how can you not afford csgo it be only 15 i guess if you be a broke then you can get this game but by all other mean get csgo much well time well spend,neg
early access reviewonly play about 4 5 hour and so far i have be enjoy it no i have not really play the 2d version of the game but i do not think it matter for a game that be only 54 mb in file size i think it be worth to download and try it obviously this mean that you should not be expect super high end graphic but i still somewhat like the artstyle the game be kinda grindy as with most mmorpg but that be to be expect the quest system also tie with the craft system in game where material drop by monster in a certain zone will usually also have an npc who will craft gear for you with say drop material alongside give you quest craft item usually will take you between 15 40 min which be reasonable in my opinion for now but i be guess it will increase as you craft higher level item currently the max level be 15 but do not let that number fool you as i have only manage to hit level 6 4 hour into the game i be not sure if it be intend but you be free to change between the various class whenever you want at any level and for the most part gear can be use across all class i start off as a warrior but since change to a mage who hit way harder overall a decent game,pos

if you be new to the game or to steam i do not recommend this game all the player will hate you and report you and also dota will accept their report and penalize you for not be good at the game i have play about 40 hrs i think just to get to know the game and i have be report over 10 time and penalize way too much for it so if you be a new pc player or steam player or a dota player do not get involve with this game i spend countless hour just learn the basic of it only to be ridicule for be not as good as the pro which consist of the childish people who do not understand what its like work for a living and not be able to play all the time,neg

early access reviewif you like magic or other card game with some strategy and depth to them i would highly recommend check this game out this be a genuinely good f2p card game that be worth your attention or at least try and i have be hook since i have find it it be a lot more fair on pricing and hand out card than similar game look at you hearthstone and there be some genuinely cool mechanic that make use of the fact that this be a pc game without just make them all lol random effect such as warcry there be quite a bit of content here include several campaign and roughly 100 puzzle to help you learn and mess with the mechanic in the game plus you can do draft free gauntlet against the computer with interesting boss mechanic and other it may take you a bit of time to make the exact deck you want but it be totally viable without spend money and i think this be a quality enough game to spend a little on anyway as a thank you to the dev for their hard work hope you enjoy,pos
it be a great game at it be core but the repair cost at the high tier begin to become more than the payout force player to either play in low tier or pay real money to get premium allow them to get more of the free currency per game the game seem far too center on be pay to win to leave this review positive,neg
honestly one of the good card game i have play in a while it be deep complex not rng overloaded and have a very mature art style in my time i have play some card game like mtg and hearthstone and can say that this game be on the same level and it be relatively new you also get a ton of stuff for free when you start and grinding process while there be not painfully boring oh and solo arena be amazing,pos
early access reviewi will admit that i be a little dissapointed to see two of the class not available yet to play and in the spirit of full disclosure the localisation be bad but with the exception of the final fantasy game alot of eastern import be pretty rough around the edge in the beginning i be still play the game and enjoy myself though so it be not be game break for me yet it seem like there be be a rather large dry spell lately with mmorpg so i will also admit to be excited just to have something new but again i have be play since the very first day of early access may 28th and still find myself look forward to log in after get home from work everyday combat be enjoyable and i do have to give neowiz prop for not turn their cash shop into a total pay to win cash grab so far only thing available be totally cosmetic with a couple of only minor 20 hunting xp and craft xp accelerator overall still enjoy the game will continue post in the future when i get another chance,pos

well this be one of my fav free to play game on steam and when i say free to play it be free to play anyone can say this game require real money but if you spend some time play it you can reach a conclusion that if you do enough daily dungeon skirmish and pvp you will get a lot of astral diamond and with those diamond you can convert to zen coin so yeah totaly free to play game i have spend some time now and i have create and delete a lot of character and in my opinion they be pretty well make with a lot of awesome combo in my opinion this game still need a little of optimization for low end pc oh and one more thing i request a gm help because i have my misson bug and within 1 2min my problem be fix no joke dgood game with awesome gameplay easy to learn and endless fun neverwinter be one of the best free to play game on steam right now and you play it,pos
early access reviewwhile the game have alot of promise right now its no where near what be advertise and the lack of end game and challenging experience make the game not worth it,neg
this game hard to recommend to everyone so i will not i will recommend it to people who have weird compulsive disorder and like meticulously take thing apart piece by piece and see how it work because that be all you do in this game and it be awesome and it be free what be not awesome be that you have to invite friend to the game to unlock certain feature and the game really stunt your ability to progress like any other social casual f2p game it be fine because they have to make money somehow on the other hand if you be willing to take apart the same weapon a few time and wait a day inbetween binging session you can easily get enough point to progress without spend a cent can not beat that deal it be great fun if you be super weird and like take stuff apart that be pretty much it just try it it be 90 mbs and free if you do not like it you can try it and be do in like 15 minute,pos

just a p2w game unfair and unbalanced match make systemyou have to buy all the story mission except the first one you start withyou can just buy most card outright include legenday one by spend moneygaining in game gold be an extreamly slow process do not expect to get enough to buy even one pack of 6 card a daypretty much everything in the game be set up so you have to pay real money to progress you can not enter any of the game type except 1 on 1 without ticket which cost alot of in game gold or you can just buy them outrighti would love to recommend this game since it really be fun to play but with snail like progression and a money hungry game system it get stale fast unless spend lot of money i be not sure why bethesda would make such a money hungry game like this kinda feel like a big fu to all the fan out there who really enjoy play te game if the gold system be fix so progression be not snail pace and there be more to the story mode without pay actual cash i would recommend this but right now its just not worth it,neg

be play this game since 2014 little less than 4 year now take a break during breach and prophecy league as i be play other game i never once doubt that ggg would keep develop a great game and try it back during closed beta i know that they would bring us an arpg bring us the d1 and d2 vibe that d3 fail to bring now sit in 2018 i be glad i stick with this game and support them through buy supporter pack and mtx from the cash shop for new player i believe that the game learn curve have get easy with the ammount of guide from the community and gggs own little tutorial at the beginning of a new character although the curve to get into the game have get easy the challenge of earn currency build a great character and the endgame have not get any easy infact even harder true poe have build that make the game content look like a joke and there will always be a meta but the fun the game bring through run map at endgame or simply level through act 1 10 have not change i have not always play on steam as there be client issue in multiple league so my hour have not all be on record but i will say i have atleast 3k total hour and count in this game and plan on many more if people be doubt whether the game be truly free to play look at other review go into the game yourself or even just watch video the game be truly free it bring no advantage to those who support the cash shop be strictly cosmetic and convenience what i do recommend for a player willing to spend money in this game be catch the sale they have weekly and always buy on sale they run multiple stash tab sale and you should only really buy when they be on sale unless you be 1st start out i highly recommend buy 1 currency tab 1 quad tab 1 map tab and 1 premium tab essence divination and fragment tab be pure convenience and really be only for those who truly want a tab for all the small thing if you can not spend 20 on a game you can enjoy for hour at a time and can put down and comeback later and still find new content or continue on standard then you should not be play a f2p game at all to close this wall of text i recommend any new player who enjoy arpg and the d1 and d2 to try this game if you be simply want to cure your itch for lose ark or whatever other new arpg come out in the future poe be a great way to do so if you just simple enjoy arpg and want a fair cash shop crazy build customization and hour of fun then download and start play,pos

i know i be only 8 hour here but i be well over 100 on ps4 just want to comment about how i be sure the new tower have help with the flow of the game but i do not like what it be do for the feel of the game or the farm for cosmetic i like be able to drop into a power level range and see all sort of different type of biome instead of just have the biome correlate to certain power level range like they do now it be a lot more fun if i can grind stuff that i want to grind that be relevant to my level while mostly stay in biome type i want to play need cosmetic from if i be miss something please someone let me know,neg

product receive for freeit deliver upon what the name imply and often that be all you should expect from a free game that say there be flaw that leave me not to recommend it you can not use your mouse in the menu there be no volume slider the resolution can only be set to wrong and bad and have no manual imput click new game automatically override your previous save without a confirmation mouse drag because the game have an fps cap i be assume that be the reason anyway you can not pause the game or otherwise access the menu during a cutscene you can not move backwards in the menu by press esc alt tabbing leave the game audio on alt tabbing while not have the game pause or in a menu trap your cursor in the center of your screen which can only be resolve by open your task manager and forcefully close the application without your mouse or restart your pc the last be my main concern honestly it be a very minor issue if you know what be go on but it be intrusive and i could imagine it to be quite difficult to deal with if you be not the kind of person who use the task manager frequently or simply do not know how to use shortcut except for alt tab though it could still be trigger by program like skype all in all it feel like a mobile port and a poor one at that the pixelized stylization be alright and overall the game be decent enough but i can not be bother to put up with such an absolute bottom of the barrel ui,neg

early access reviewfirst off wow i absolutely love this game i can not get enough you guy have do an outstanding job on this but i be have as issue here and it be really not top priority i be sure i have be have trouble with some of my replay it seem they be get corrupt or something not super sure though but i be one to go back and look at my previous game and either see what i do wrong or maybe check out something cool that happen or watch a stupid mistake but when i go to watch the replay the character start just do their own thing i have see it in smash bros project m but i suppose that it be because its a mod but a match that i finish with 8 point in the replay everyone in the match just suicide until they be at 25 point or below probably just some weird bug or something not totally sure though thank you so much for all the hard work i be sure you put into this game i have a great time and really this issue be not a huge deal but i think i would let you know,pos

early access reviewdo not let them fool you 11 jul 2014 be not the actual release this game have be out there a few year already just not list on steam and tbh they have not make any real progress the same oldmap the same 12 rifle the same fcke up f2p economy you can not even chat with the enemy team they have rend some of the cheap server they could find somewhere in south asia so a ping 80 be the good you can get in europe 170 the average and over 300 if you have bad luck meaning 1 of 5 server be unplayable and once you have join a server you be trap until the battle end this game have great potential i be so exited when i hear of it be launch see the trailer for the first time and the plan they have intente but the developer attempt the f2p method which fail miserably i have no idea what this game be head to but i do not think it will ever reach a finished state,neg
early access reviewthis game have go from fun to terrible in such a short space of time initially the game be about build a robot which require you to have some skill and design idea around it you also have to actually aim your gun there be a purchase system where you could purchase extra credit and premium to further on your design or get that weapon you want the most recent update to this game have bring fourth weapon you do not need to aim robot you need no skill to fly and random chance on the block you to actually build your robot but hey you can purchase crate from the pay store to hopefully complete the robot you have plan i would suggest anyone very strongly to think again before spend any real life cash on this game as it will most likely be waste by the developer on awful update if you want to check out the kind of feedback they have go to their game forum,neg
i buy this game yesterday 9 29 17 and it crash everytime i try to play it give an error report suggest that i send it to someone but i can not find that error report nor do i know who to send it to if i could i even reinstall the game very very disappointed in the game until fix i would not suggest to anyone to pay 49 00 for it be go to request that i get a refund,neg
early access reviewi really use to like this game i would as many do recommend this game to my friend tell them that it be really fun and a cool little buildy game it have a free to play aspect but i be ok with that i even give the developer some money and buy some item i now wish that i have save my money this game have like many of my bot be fly into the ground at a rapid rate after several of the important bit have be take away it use to be that you would build a robot of a certain tier and would be match with similar robot hear complaint about how you could exploit the ranking system they attempt to balance it but it be a crap method of do so by completely remove the system at this point i stop play for a while i come back to this game hearing of a new update and they have in fact remove feature you do not need a pilot seat armor have be completely rework and they have make glass which be such a cool looking block into a freakin cosmetic item and the only way to get cosmetic item be with real money oh do i mention that most color of paint you need to pay for sigh verdict if freejam pull their act together i would heartily recommend this game however in its current state i would say hold off,neg
product receive for freeearly access reviewthis be a good strategy action game where positioning and teamplay be very important good variety of big ship and with the new update more crewmember which increase the effect of your own playstyle remember maneuver be the key to succes when in combat cheap replayable good look dev and their develop work lot of grind if you do not want to pay bug here and there but mostly solid early acce you have 3 faction and your money which you grind focus only on the faction which you play with i wish that the money would be universal between the faction,pos
early access reviewgreat game start off with some issue but the dev be commit to fix the issue and 4 day into release have already add stuff they say be 1 2 week away i be assume in an effort to appease player the lack of a p2w system be refresh in comparison to most mmo now a day and seem to be get good value for your purchase purely base off the dev there be still some issue but come to be expect but with everything i have see hear the dev be commit to make this game an awesome way to spend a few hour a day but this opinion may be just off the fact i have see change from the other version of this game release and have patience to deal with some more change while it remain in early access d,pos
  consistent update amazing support ever grow end game content new refreshing content every 3 month with a league free to play no pay to win aspectwhat more could you want from a hack and slash,pos
it would be ok if there be not like a million dlc for this game as far as i can tell pretty much all the car cost like 2 as well as other track i get this game way back when it be actually be sell to so its in my libary as purchase pretty disapointing to say the least may as well skip this game and buy another game that actually have the car in base game its 25 gb 4 gb of patch if you just want to try it which be quite a lot for a demo,neg
ok it be free of course i will try it well 1 7 hour and i have not kill anything because everything i have find i can not shoot because i have not give them money so this be the worst free game ever but possibly a good hunting game i still can not say if the latter be true because i can not seem to hunt anything and i be not go to pay just to try,neg
it be a rather fun game but it could really use a much large playerbase much of the battle you fight be mean to be on a grand scale but they do not turn out too grand when there be only 2 people on each side,pos
an amazing free game that have enormous map to discover and have a satisfy feel of progression there be an extensive range of class to pick from so there be always a class and playstyle for you,pos
elsword be probably my all time favorite pc game and i have be play it for a little over 3 year now many give it a bad reccomendation because of its claim to be a free to play and say that it be a pay to win i will admit that i have put quite a bit of money into elsword but that be simply because i love the game and have an addiction to the pvp side of it however if you play mostly for dungegon and be not a pvp orient person you can surely get by perfectly fine without pay a dime put money into it be all up to you and your preference either way really good equipment set can be obtain through do secret dungeon and that be always free just a lot of work that some people be not up to so my point be elsword be not 100 pay to win i would totally recommend try the game out,pos
early access reviewi do not get how people can rate this game so positive the gunplay be absolute garbage the animation movement be a pure joke and this game feel absolutely clunky not even worth download for free,neg
a fairly addictive 2d bullet hell game be prepare to grind a lot but the grinding be far from boring dungeon be randomly generate and can also have treasure room to multiply your loot gain by far my favorite part of the game be the loot system the more damage you do to the boss the more loot you get it inscentivises and reward actively tackle the boss instead of leech though some more difficult boss drop treasure chest that contain the loot the game currently still have a lot of problem leave by the old developer kabam logic instead of fix duping let us just make a lot of the rare item in the game untradable we will ban some people for hack if they be report but not have moderator to actively survey the situation let us make some of the good item in the game available for purchase in the starting area for ten dollar so that new player can see how great we be all in all 10 10 praise deca,pos
early access reviewphenomenal once again artix entertainment have bring a completely original and engaging game to life i honestly do not know what i enjoy more the team member or the game its self despite be in beta it be already chock full of content there be a bit more to be do but that be to be expect i have yet to see another company that can live up to it be promise and then some keep go guy you be do great,pos

i play this game during beta and recently get it on steam when it come out it be an insanely great game fun dungeon always something to do something new to grind towards without be to hard now you can grind for hour upon hour and not even get close to what you want the new gem system be good in theory but be execute poorly class now cost real money to get really take away from the excitement make everything untradable have make it hard for new player to get a grip on thing that maybe they can not farm or just do not want to spend hour farm the lag have become almost unbearable beta have little lag now i can not climb a dungeon without rubber band back down its frustrating overall if this game be its former self and easy 10 10 but now its a 2 10,neg

early access reviewmy goodness for a free game i must say that it be good close to rival pubg maybe even better it be really good graphic and be pretty well optimize i would definitely recommend this game,pos
early access reviewafter almost 200 hour and achieve the rank of master two season in a row i feel like i can write a proper review for eternal this game be great it be almost disgustingly free to play you will be shower in pack and card when you first begin and get a free card pack on your first rank win a day have keep me return time and time again however if you be look for a cheap alternative to hearthstone you be probably look for shadowverse eternal be not an easy game by any mean the power system be very similar to magic the gathering which can be very off put for anyone who have not play it before i believe draw mana make the game more complex and allow for a wide array of deck than could ever be achieve in a system that give you one mana every turn if the occasional mana flood or mana screw really bother you this just be not go to be the game for you if you have be look for a complex ccg with all the deep mechanic of magic the gathering while also be very generous in how easy it be to collect i can not recommend eternal enough tl dr not great if you be just tired of hearthstone but if you be willing to sit down and learn it be quirk there be a truly complex and interesting card game that be very accomodating of small budget,pos
this game be perfect in many way it be well than minecraft in other it lack some of the technical ability with wiring that addon for mc have but its much pretty a lot more fun and with some cool concept plus the concept of world adventure and server be much better streamline plus there be a well community the people complain in the review about this not be to play but to build for other to play do not get the point of this game but there be a learning curve that take time to adjust to,pos
well a month back this game be bad but cool lot of crash hard to start but nice to play with friend the dev do not seem to be do anything at all to make the game better just to kill it even more than it already be and add lot of skin to earn money ofc today be the rip for me i would like to see this be a good game but like thing be go i have almost to no hope,neg
early access reviewin its current early access alpha stage i think this game be very nice looking and fun obviously it could use balancing and fix and stuff since it be alpha early access but it be fairly good so far very interesting and varied ship design with nice theme base on faction if you be interested in graphic then you may like the fact that the game look very good even on low setting although i will say the station model could use work not that it be much of a problem though since you be usually shoot other ship as for gameplay it be good that there be a somewhat wide variety of ability and strategy base on the ship you use the unlock system do not feel like it take too long although it would be nice if get credit be just a bit faster the premium currency do not over saturate the game either which be a plus they do not shove it down your throat like other game also i may be a tad biased because i get the game for free prop to these guy for the free weekend that let me keep the game 3,pos
i have to admit my patience be already wear thin from this game from launch but it recently become free to play so i think why not give it another shot not so supprising nothing but issue yet again all this time they have have to correct optimize crash issue and loading time everything about this game be a joke it do not supprise me at all it have become free to play so quick and hell even free to play it be not worth it they should be pay you to play this game never again,neg

a great game with an emphasis on teamwork and knowledge of game mechanic fracture space be a a beautiful game with great visual and sound design it have a very heavy focus on teamwork so be polite cooperate and read your ally and your enemy behaviour be key you will need to learn and fast each ship similar to hero in other moba and moba esk games have be strength weakness and purpose understanding how to play each ship be key most game follow a fairly similar pattern cap mine fight for gamma attack enemy base do not let that fool you though just because the game have a mould do not mean you have to follow it each match will have it be different fight and in each fight you may have to play slighly differently and if you emerge victorious from a fight you do feel a sense of pirde however it be not without it be flaw the first and most important one be balance with so many ship and so many factor to take into account the game could be say to be unbalanced and that would not be wrong it would however be a very narrow view as a player with over 500 hour play spread over around 2 year i have see unbalanced in f and it be do nothing but improve and the dev have do nothing but learn if slowly at time but the game be not perfect when it come to balance dare i say it will never be perfect but which game be the single big issue however be the match maker or mm it use a system call mmr which be base on win victory and defeat to balance match needless to say it be not the good system it be be endlessly debate moan about change tweak and be a constant work in progress if i be you do not get angry about it other will but just try to play the game help other and carry hard the second be to do with ecg themselves have talk to the dev i know they be a great bunch of guy and girl that only want to make the game be fun and enjoyable for everyone they just have a funny way of show it sometimes from random experimental patch suprise launch or lack of communication ecg definitely have their own way of do thing overall fractured space be a great game with fun and varied gameplay but not always balanced and with a wip mm ecg can seem to be a bit random at time but they mean well,pos
do not let steam hour fool you i have be play this since beta on the normal client i literally download this on steam just to throw my two cent in i will just say this if you enjoy other mobas you will most likely enjoy smite that be say the game be undergo a major shift and the developer be jump ship they be go from hi rez example employee name to titan example employee name this be be use to distinguish between the two group of hirez one be project titan and the other be simply hirez you can expect the eventual dropping of the original dev to the new one half of the problem that the game be currently face be due to inconsistency i will explain most player whether they be new or old can tell you that the game be incredibly inconsistent this be that you can queue for a match and if you be lucky enough to get in and not you be unable to be match and be now the high queue which literally reset your queue for another 10 15 minute if you be lucky to get in you will see one of two thing one or multiple people on your team that be exceedingly low level and should not be in your game or one or more enemy that be low level and should not be in your game either way it be simply not enjoyable rofl stomp some poor guy that s a low level when he should not be in your game be not fun for anyone it be not fun for him and it be not fun for me and it actually have a high chance of run new player away match make inconsistency be more often than not the cause for player frustration i have be play since the beta and i be burn out i play literally 10 game in a row and literally have trash player on my team that throw the game i should never be pair with less than 120 that be sloppy match make playing with friend should be fun i have play countless hour with friend and one design flaw remain whomever queue for the game and be the party leader rule the match make i be normally the party leader and we typically get player between 100 160 aside from the low level we get team with and while this be fine we have a few player that be new and have difficulty keep up with player that be 100 so to remedy this we will have our low level player host and queue for match and that s where it become apparent that the match making be literal trash because if he queue the party we go up against player that be his level not mine hirez claim that the match make take the cumulative level of the party and match make rating and queue them with the player close to themselves well we just prove that be so now we be in a game with player under 30 and i be 130 so i have two option i can rofl stomp these low level player or i can hang back and let them experience the game i do not want to throw the game for us but i do not want to be that player that s farm lowbie that be not fun for anyone and i want the player base to keep grow not shrink god class favoritism be rampant you can clearly see which god class be favor more than any of them just by look at the number there be currently 98 god out of those 98 there be 29 mage 20 assassin 18 hunter 14 warrior and 17 guardian mage be the most overpowered and thusly the most play there be mage that be so ridiculous you can not close the gap to actually get to them this can be see with god like ah puch discordia baron nox zeus vulcan etc it be exceedingly rare that mage be bad however there be many god that be simply in a terrible state such as ratatoskr pele artio terra jing wei nike osiris etc part of this issue be that hirez balance god strictly around conquest their main mode the funny thing be most people do not play conquest they play arena and assault to this end the game be unbalanced severely you jump into an assault which be a 5v5 with random god across the board and you fight an ah puch you be basically screw he can keep more pressure on you than most player can get around if your team do not get a mage you be basically screw god like pele be fantastic in conquest she be design to be a jungler and be the current good jungler out that be say on any other mode besides conquest she be utter trash this be part of a major problem for smite balance the game for a mode that most people do not play as admit too by hirez exec do not work it lead to people quit due to frustration when all they want to do be play the damned game and have fun which be what game be suppose to be smite be literally flood with t cosmetic that do nothing but take space in chest to prevent you from actually get the skin you want you have 1 god skins 2 ward skin 3 avatar 4 loading frame 5 pedestal 6 social emote 7 recall skin 8 hud theme 9 loading screen background 10 jump stamp 11 fountain skin 12 level up skin 13 death mark 14 title 15 music theme 16 announcer pack 17 vgs voice packsand you can bet yourthat all of these be fill the the brim with absolute trash that you do not want but be just there as filler for chest hirez be incredibly greedy and literally throw cosmetic in the way to make you spend more gem real world money onyou do not want just so you can maybe get the skin you want i can not prove it but i be certain that chest be rig so you only get the good skin at the end of the chest to put it simply if you pay 200 gem for one chest roll you will most likely get and see as there be mostly 55 item in one chest you be go to be shell out aton of money just to maybe get the skin you want this need to be change the sheer greed of hirez show in literally everything they do these be only a few of the problem there be so many bug and issue in this game it be absolutely insane in it be current state i would not recommend anyone play this unless you be interested in sub par game and shoddy match miserysimulator2018,neg

early access reviewwhen i get this game i figure it would be a breath of fresh air compare to all these hardcore battle royale game around right now little do i know under it be wacky quirky exterior it be exactly the same as pubg co this game be essentially pubg but more buggy still a walking simulator well gun always win floaty movement as if glide across the ground awful 3rd 1st person system find many glitch exploit some of which extremely helpful peak through roof to see enemy take like one shot to kill anyone regardless of their armour some gun blatantly overpower m30 luftwaffe drilling be able to bind a waffle iron onto your leg for armour do not compensate for the fact that this be just more pubg shovelware,neg
ok first off yes i will say if your expect a game that s up to adult standard and attraction then your not look in the right place this game be gear towards a young generation however it still can be enjoyable i start it with a f2p monsterous nightmare and earn enough gem easily to have a flightmare bundle for free its just like any other f2p game with micro transaction you can earn the gem to get anything you want but you have to work for it they be not just go to hand you the gem,pos
early access reviewdo not be fool this game be pay to win yes the game be generous in common card but that be the scam you will never grind out enough or the correct legendary card to compete unless you buy them a single legendary card will more often than not completely trump a well think out deck even when you be far ahead you have be warn otherwise the game be fun if you stay away from the top decking ai play rank and casual at a low level to avoid player that have pay to win,neg

a lot of people hate the game because gaijin change thing for the bad arcade be increasingly unbalanced with premium plane no one want to do realistic because if they go 2fast4u the wing rip off engine failure ammo problem spin out everything real plane be susceptible to or because germans get 1 shoot by mericans however if you can look past the fact that increase imbalance have cause the game to become more unenjoyable i beg to differ all of these negative review firstly let us start off with my experience i have at least 400 hour log from the game before i join steam i have play for about a year now before steam so i know what i be talk about okay so about the game itself it be a wwii simulation arguably the good damn one out there that be and will be for a number of year mechanic in general be great and you can fine tune your plane and as of june tank to however you want to have them there be a high level of customization in the game than people think you can add decal paint the vehicle after get all upgrade for it which be kinda bs but whatever select what bomb turret bullet you want your plane to use depend on the plane tank etc etc play with friend be very easy just set up a squadron with them after find them in the chat send them a mail add them to your friend list then you be good to go for play together with them another thing be that the combat while steadily become unbalanced from how it be over a year ago be both intense and draw out most of your time will be comprise of fly around actually look for people until you be 500 km away from them ghost shot can be an issue if someone know what they be do and can actually aim without have to use the target system that show up on your screen overall though when you do get into combat it can be intense and very fun and damage on your plane be very noticeable look on my video section for a war thunder intro video there be a lot of shot where my plane s damage be show there be little music in the game if any it be recommend that you just turn on your radio pandora personal playlist mp3 ipod or whatever else you have and jam to your own tune keep sound effect be optional because 3 4 of the time all you will hear be the engine sound the other 1 4 be plane shoot and random radio call that get annoy the enemy have take the base we must get it back at all cost nosherlock overall the game be very enjoyable if you be not superhardcorepvpmustwin just be casual about it enjoy it for what it be and you will have a grand time on it like i do give it a shot and if you do not take it too seriously you will not regret it,pos
i love this game but the dev have no idea what they be do they focus more on aspect that require actual money than balance and fix game break bug such as ping suddenly shoot up to 495 then kick you from the game game also have a very obvious bias towards people who use their money to buy premium vehicle unless you have deep pocket or get very good very fast do not even bother edit i be sure now that gaijin have never see a tank operate nor research how they work avoid this game edit 2 after hit 1000 hour i can confirm this game be not worth the time the sheer laziness by gaijin be really pathetic and i be kinda ashamed i have waste so much time on this hot garbage they try to pass for a game,neg

stick more to single player campaign because the community seem to consist of nothing but grumpy vietnam era vet who do not like new fangled electronic gizmo in their plane so it be difficult to relate to the community as a young enthusiast who be interested in more modern aircraft such as the f 22 raptor or su 37 terminator i be also attack personally by the community on social medium group for protest the dev make user purchase update electronic component for their aircraft as a dlc dlc for dlc wtf really rather than release them to owner of the aircraft as an update patch you would think they would make more money by make a well product which would in turn appeal to a wide audience than to try to pump exist user for more money to update their exist purchase thus make user spend more money on what they already own instead of use that money for get new plane module while we be on the subject i will share my thought about the community for a group of mostly old gamer reasonable disscussion quickly devolve to immature name call and personal attack faster than other gaming community group to which i belong not surprisingly however none would accept an equally match duel dogfight in identical plane with identical loadout when challenge to settle the disagreement like real gamer on the battlefield honestly i have never come accross a bunch of gamer so scared to play a game in all my life at least the mechwarrior community encourage player with beef to hash out their difference live stream in game like proper gamer since we touch on the topic of new aircraft earlier i want to comment about that as well the forward think person i be like modern to futuristic style game i ask the dev community about any plan to include new plane into the sim like those mention previously ex f 22 su 37 and the condescension from both be palpable as i be mock for want such rediculously new aircraft when i ask why those plane would not be offer any time soon the reason give be the electronic system aboard those craft be still classified and so we would not be able to accurately model those system that be the reason they still do not offer an f 16 falcon despite its 30 year age because it have nuclear launch capability which be two button out of sight off to the side of the cockpit but yet classified and so they will not model the aircraft frame for player use really due to one system which historically have never be employ still be in classified status rediculous in term of historical accuracy a in term of flight modeling physics a in term of fun playablility c in term of dev community interaction fawkin fail i like all this have to promise but the actuality of the experience overall leave a bitter taste in my mouth since i feel like i be outcaste from the group due to my age before my playing ability be ever even consider in fact i never have a single 1v1 matchup because none of the pilot that i challenge would even try to fight me and i be summarily dismiss as too young to be worthy of their time if only i could sue for age discrimination in a game i would be able to buy the company and make it accessable to everyone rather than just age retire have be pilot i like it enough that i be glad it be in my library for whenever i get the single player simulator fly itch but i be still look forward to ace combat 7 to be my main multi player fighter sim since it will have more aircraft than just those build before i be bear as well as an interesting story development which be something that dcs completely lack actually it do have a few story drive camapaign but only available for purchase if you have already purchase the specific plane for which that campaign be develop again more dlc for your purchase dlc kinda rendundant do not ya think the stock campaign mission include with dcs aircracft be very dry and sterile compare to early ace combat game as a result i just do not find myself caring about which way the war go in dcs but i still wonder whatever happen to yellow 13 from the ace combat 4 story back in 2004 to this day would i recommend this game depend to whom would be my reply i would recommend it to pilot who actually fly the model of aircraft offer and want to re live their glory day or anybody with an interest in historical aircraft flight simming of wwii cold war era i see this appeal to the generation right behind the civil war re enactment group i would not recommentd this game to anyone who do not yet have gray white hair like modern aircraft or be just interested in make new simulation friend the community apperently only grant favorable acceptance to those with aarp membership new aircraft design will only be release upon declassification translate next 50years to never and good luck try to get someone to actually game with you since them old timer only know how to run their mouth abolut how much they hate us millenial but apparently do not know how to work the gun on their plane as for me this be get uninstalle and i be go to go play other stuff until ace combat 7 come out next year this game could have have potential if not for the unwillingness on the part of the dev to sacrifice real world accuracy for fun playability and the crap community of age player that only serve to suck all of the youthful enthusiasm out of my passion for fly,neg
game amazing some of the objective be annoying with the enemy for them scale with your samage over the level it be on and whilst i would change that the overall gameplay mean that after a certain point you really only need to do a general check up for it 10 10,pos
trove be a good game but it have it be draw back many of which can be blame on two thing 1 some severe lag issue for some people i hear the game do not even start i have not yet encounter that myself and it run fine for the most part for me but there be moment where thing just kinda break then again try play a game that do not have a glitch of some kind 2 pay2win now this i can understand i have see the market place and it be very restrictive on what you can get without pour dollar into this game however like warframe i know of all game why draw comparison to that one hang with me pls you can do just fine without spend a dime of course it will take a helluva lot more time to do but maybe it be worth it despite that i do reccomend this game because of 3 thing 1 friendly it be a very nice game in every way it be warm all nearby player get the loot that drop and there be no fierce competition over that shadow lvl 3 staff death be not overly punishing and the game give you a pretty good start and then encourage you to engage with the community 2 reward cooperation you get more together when you be fight with a team all of you get xp and all of you get loot even better the punishment of death can be lessen when you have a team that can revive building become easy and high level character can provide gear to less level to help them gain rank 3 appeal to a very large audience everyone young old builder adventurer people who like pretty place and people who like hell everyone will have a place in trove there be many different class for people of many different playstyle and each one can be tailor via the gear you get and the gem system threre be club for the different type of people those who like adventuring will be greet very well by adventure club builder can show off there talent to eachother at build club and so on and the good part be that everyone progress through their respective intrest in similar way result in a place where different interest collide and then be sew together in a rather lovely way there be no way i could put this on the 1 to 10 scale and be accurate so i will give it a 89 100 do the math people,pos
i love the realism of this game however i do not like the price at almost 1800 for all of the dlc average 90 per plane 10 per campaign which you have to have the plane for say campaign purchase and the list go on the price tag be ridiculous,pos
be play this game for a few good hour try to unlock every recipe and build cool stuff after unlock everything and hit the wall of premium that have no use in thig game everything start to feel like dead and out of interest the game feel like a copy out of minecraft with a nice resourcepack and with sofisticated complex crafting that give this game a big plus at the same time a minus also if you really want to create thing make you miss the creative mode from minecraft the creature in the game be to damn easy to kill and feel lifele compare to minecraft they tend to bug make them easy to kill run in circle around them while slash i love the idea of portal wow that be cool feature give a different angle to adventure the hand that suck everything out of anything it be well then the medieval pickaxe shovel axe hand i would probably have more to say but its late and lose my idea but i will say this this game its just an improvement of minecraft that do not mean it have anything to do with it while it have many bug and exploit available the game be fun but due to its complex nature it make it abit boring after a while especially when you want to do it in scale but thank you extractor bomb excavator now we only need x ray not really but after you unlock and do everything the game feel like finish a game in story mode and that s it compare to minecraft where even if it get bore at least you can find something to do but this be just my opinion the mechanical part and decoration keep you up to the task to bad you can not find server with more then 5 player make the game more for friend group etc rather then for a new comer the end i would have say more but as i mention before lose my idea plus i be not good with write reveiew rather discuss them,pos
early access reviewi get this game solely for my brother the training course give you the op gun but when you get the class you equip bb gun the next issue i have be that this be wwii base and yet we be battle the ussr get your fact right we do hate the commie but they be our ally in this war the new update have make it impossible for u s to win due to the spamming of tank that be almost impenetrable conclusion this game be still in beta and show alot of promise if they fix the game mechanincs and balance the class and vehicle this may just may be agood game until then i ask those who care about historical battle to wait until the creator of the game fix these issue,neg
early access reviewi think this game have a lot of potential there be many feature that have to come aq3d be just not finish yet and there be still quite some work with the passion of ae i think it really can be something the game feel much well than close beta especially in the combat section death animation and small change help a lot also the fact that the game be strive for weekly update which be very nice and you can play it on your mobile phone which be really awesome i just hope that they change the ui for pc i have talk with the dev and they say they will go check it out especially their animator korin which have the same idea as i in there new update on the game they address on some important thing like the ui for pc and combat which be amazing and i be so happy they wil try to do something about it dutch ik vind dat dit game veel potentie heeft er zijn veel feature die moeten komen aq3d be gewoon nog niet af en er moet nog wat flink aan gewerkt worden meet de passie van ae denk ik dat het echt iets kan worden de game voelt veel better dan close beta vooral in de combat death animation en kleine veranderingen helpen veel ook het feit dat de game graag weekly update wil be heel fijn en dat je het op je mobiel kan spelen be ook fijn ik hoop alleen dat ze de ui veranderen voor pc ik heb meet de dev gepraat en ze zeiden dat ze erin zullen gaan kijken vooral hun animator kori vind dat het veranderde moet worden test dit game en als je potentie ziet wacht to winter in hun niewste update van de game hebben ze het over hoe ze de ui voor pc willen gaan veranderen en de combat ik ben heel blij dat ze iets er aan gaan doen,pos
the game be extrectly technical depend on what you be look for this title could be so much fun or terrible boring very much for a technical profile and real life pilot train the game be awsome not for casual player,pos
early access revieweternal be like magic the gathering but with a dark tower esque theme it be an incredibly rich and deep strategy card game that be extremely rewarding for a ftp title it be get colorful and vibrant artwork and table intuitive ui and easy to understand mechanic the only downside for new player at the moment be the mandatory tutorial mission at the beginning that drag for entirely too long but if you can muscle through the beginner content you will find an amazingly rewarding digital card game like no other,pos
early access reviewthe dev really want to make this game look pretty with all the fancy screenshot and artwork and upgrade and currency and everything then you get into the game i use to play a lot of cod back in the day i do not know whether i get so rusty or be it the game it be just so clunky shooting at thing it just do not fall reliable or good for me it be just really annoying and i think they know that hence the whole currency system yeah you be not have fun but you can earn point and buy well gear so that should keep you play you get a bad gun at the beginning and you be suppose to kill stuff exclusively with that gun for fifteen hour if you want to get a decent one but have to play more if you want good upgrade correct me if i be wrong but the more point you get in game the more currency you be award if you just get out out of the low level incubator you be pin against experienced people with tank sniper etc i personally do not like run 3 minute to the battlefront just to get shoot down from who know where in cod that only take like 10 second my point be i be really really frustrated by the game there be no real reason for me to play it i find play the game a drag with the only motivation be get currency for well gun you spawn you run for 2 3 min and maybe maybe you kill a few peep or even make a cap if you be new and have not spend money that will be the case i know the graphic be good the model be pretty it have car and tank and plane and on paper it be a really good game model but i get little actual fun from it to the dev i really do not know what would make me rethink maybe drastically low grind time i dunno sry my opinion a pretty look grindy waste of time,neg
could not play the game have a resolution problem could not get past what look to be a user agreement screen try to change to config file and still could not change the resolution to see the resolution properly,neg
pick this up on a whim and think it would be a gimmick or uninteresting especially be free i be wrong the developer put a lot of work into this game the model in game be base on real world model every part be label with it be correct name down to the small pin roller and spring if you be detail orient mechanically minded or simply curious this will be up your alley whether you be a firearm enthusiast or simply wonder how firearm function check this game out i do not even consider this to be a game but more of a fun educational tool with game on the side there be pay aspect but only if you want to progress faster or move onto a subject other than gun such as military vehicle race car even skeleton etc as for progression within the gun world it be free the game consist of assembly dis assembly function game include a firing range and even paint the firearm you can try to disassemble then reassemble as fast as you can without hasty click and without error for extra point it be very challenging and i be adept at this use actual firearm the x ray feature allow the player to see inside a firearm even while fire reload safety on off etc this be what i like the most about it in the real world one can take apart an actual gun learn the name of the part and understand the basic function but to see the piece in action while inside the gun give us a well understanding of how all the part work together the model be pretty good look too they be not super high re but they be not low res either my only two complaint with this game the way one move around the gun part to get a different angle be awkward sometimes frustrating but it be not game break bad not by any mean just an annoyance at time some area of the breakdown and assembly be draconian when it should not be for example the ak 47 one do not have to remove the accessory pouch from the rifle butt before remove the rifle butt in real life the game penalize the player if the pouch be not remove first though this problem be more of a developer attitude of you have to follow my procedure even if it be not necessary in the real world this be not game breaking either but very frustrating when try to go from start to finish with zero error overall i would recommend this game 100 9 10,pos
early access reviewthis game really start out with so much potential but it all go downhill when the dev decide to make the game pay to play what be the point of playing when i could just take out my credit card and get whatever i want the point of a progression system be to let people learn to play the game before give them all it have to offer but if you can just buy your way up what s the point of a progression system the thing that personally piss me of the most though be all the unnecessarily useless feature in the game like weapon repairing and the fact a scope cost more than e tank honestly the good way to fix this game would be to delete everything and pull up a save from a two year ago it be not to late but in the state it be now i can not possible recommend it to anyone,neg
99 of the review on the hunter be negative because people complain about how it be market as a free to play game if you want to play the game properly you will have to spend a bit of money but after you get a membership the game become sooooooo much better you need to be patient to play the hunter and by the look of the other review not many people on steam be make sure you play the tutorial or you will have no idea what you be do and maybe watch a youtube video or two e g thehunter beginner guide 2016 by hoocairsthehunter if you be a new guest i recommend stick to the tower and call the deer to you as they can see smell and hear you alot well with guest clothe on there be free shotgun in the store which i do not think many guest know about so get the shotgun and go clay pigeon shooting do not worry about waste ammo because it be unlimited in the vacinity of a range or lodge or go pheasant hunting and if you like it buy the membership i also recommend go to thehunter on wikia as it give you tonne of information on reserve and where you can specifically find the animal,pos
so i think i would update my review since thing have change the positive of this game be in no order incredible optimization incredible graphic incredible attention to detail with the vehicle model not damage model though enormous selection of vehicle to playthe downside be gaijin be completeand basically the die fetus of the ussr hard to figure out mechanic for a lot of thing russian vehicle often have game break bug or problem that benefit them that go without fix for month if it hurt them then patch in a day non russian vehicle have a game break bug that benefit them for a day before it be completely patch if it do not benefit them month on end no fix shell that russian vehicle do not mainly use solid ap apds hesh etc be underperforming and unrealistic smoke launcher do not work but you can use artillery which make much more smoke as smoke screen atgms completely ruin what little balance there be matchmaker can be stupidly biased with one team stack with 8 0 tank and enemy team have 7 0 tank basically a point pinata lot of prototype pay to win vehicle grind be e ridiculous repair price be so bad that only the top three people on either team will earn money run good graphic be a disadvantage harder to see enemy in tank lot of unrealistic map and unrealistic situation for tank beta game be use as an excuse for problem when it have content that cost 40 ing quid keep add content without fix content in game community be full of weebs i mean what the off with your anime fetish underage tank girl this be literally the reason germany start kick off easy to exploit game problem lack of information in tank rb make it incredibly tense long winded and really hair raise compression at top tier be so bad that less people play entry level jet and then gaijin compress it more to lower matchmaker time and then less people play aircraft below that aka gaijin just increase br range and low rp cost and these problem will sort themselves lot of arcade gamemode for realistic tank gaijin claim to have realism and do in a lot of aspect but will ignore the community with overwhelming evidence cough maus 240 mm front plate literally measure in real life with a tape measure and gaijin just e ignore it and leave it at 220 mm and other time will change thing in the name of balance instead of realism lot of german suspension be crap in game but there be a video of a panther roll over bump with no problem but in game you break and the entire vehicle wobble for 5 second before the gun can be line up with the target awful tournament which nobody play and end up be money grab get free content require grind off your entire life do not add ship despite lead the community to believe that they could play proper naval vessel and instead add boat because everyone want to sail in rubber ing dingys instead of hms warspite british tank be e boss and actually competitive when first introduce because of apds whilst it be maybe too powerful all solid round across the board be nerfe so that british round be now not only laser pointer but cost silly amount spalling do not exist and apparantly a human in a tank be able to completely absorb a 5 kg round travel at 1400 m s able to penetrate 250 mm of solid steel at 2 km yeh apds have a you hit it you kill it policy with ammorack so if you be off by 2 cm then congrat that ammorack survive and that be 400sl down the drain so to summarize it be a good game with good quality but it be a grind and have extensive problem gaijin be so far up their ownthat they can taste their own tonsil and will never listen to community feedback lest it disadvantage their agenda good luck if you do try it though,neg
great monopoly game that run smooth and be free downside be microtransaction but if you get together with a group of 4 friend it be pretty fun by fun i mean cry and yell at eath other and ruinne friendship cause this game be rig,pos
the only reason i write this review be that hopefully some change may be do when i first see this game come to steam i be happily suprise as i be a long timer in this game play the mobile version for a very long time and reach the top of global leaderboard the problem i have with this game be not defenetly the quality of the game or the system the use for microtransaction which i actually feel be pretty fair the base problem i have be that the game be stupidly easy once you figure one single tactic the tactic in question be the dart ninja monkey anti lead usually sniper monkey or ninja stun grenade banana farm tower combo with the round 13 regen rainbow rush for the people that be not deeply aware of this strategy let me enlighten you how a normal game could look like place down dart ninja monkey place down banana farm upgrade tower round 12 sell all your farm and use both powerup round 13 just spam the send for regen 3 rainbow ballon and win this be litterally all you have to do to have success in this game once you do it you will find success currently my winrate be about 85 percent and all my loss be to other people with the same strategy but they be just slightly faster spamme the rainbow ballon this be really bad for the game long term and be the reason why i abandonne it on mobile despite be among top player in the world please now take care of your game use your tool at disposal to nerf this strategy and the game may actually turn out pretty fun and tacticly interessting this problem be not new at all but please do something now note i know they do a slight price nerf to the dart monkey but it be not a big deal at all as you have more than enough money from the banana farm to kill your opponent round 13 simply not a good nerf enough,neg
early access reviewnazis ride bike 10 10 good wargame of the year on a serious note its a decent game only problem be the matchmaking 2 10 of the game i play where so unbalanced most of the time there be us ride on bike vs the other team with epic tank destroyer we would get our ass hand to us but remember that this be intentional from the very begin developer want h g to be more like a real war this game be not about fair battle mirror team and kill to death ratio its about take what you get and use it to the good of your ability and if you want to influence battle even more you can become a general more often than not the game be unfair but it can be fun in its own way its most certainly not for everyone though the way they make it be a far cry from how war be fight you do not give your soldier inadequate gear and weapon then send them off to the slaughter and expect them to win you give them equipment that be better suit for the situation and be capable of stand some sort of a stance sir the enemy have a squad of tank what should we do well we have a ton a bike use those b but sir do i stutter saddle up and peddle on out there son the tank vs bike battle come to be because of the difference in source that each faction have from my understanding the unbalance be partially cause by the people play on the axis side have have way more warfund to buy resource with than the people in the ally side this cause the unbalance in battle and the one sided war that have occur for some time now additionally since the axis side end up wine more often player switch faction and thus more player end up join the axis which do not help much with the balance if you be on the ally side the above reason be the likely cause of the bike vs tank battle additionally if you want to avoid these sort of battle when play on either faction when you click on enter combat select find mission and when you click on a battle you can view the resource available at that time choose random mission match you in a battle without take resource into account,pos

early access reviewwhat be wrong with you people read my review for a real and true opinion review 1 this mostly positive that you see here be fake most of the positive review be short note and be to be believe as false review to make the game seem like it be actually worth your time 2 unless you a damn millionaire do not even log on or install aqo artix this time want to take all your money for content that be free in the browser edition and will only let you be successful in game if you pay 19 99 or 49 99 for this founder pack it be complete bull crap 3 artix know most of their player be young so why would they only allow people who want to pay to have content i do not know about you but it be clearly a scam for either your money or your parent 4 there should be no reason to have beta testing with not even 10 content avalible to all player what be wrong with you artix how can anyone possibly know what aqo be unless they fork out just to f king please you 5 just because it be 3d do not mean it be well it be a piece of garbage throw together that way artix can hit both mobile gamer and pc gamer what a terrible idea because there be not that many people who can even get addict enough to pay your dumb price of a phone app and no pc gamer be go to pay 19 99 if they can just play elder scroll online for free or what about guild war 2 for free or even well world of warcraft which be worth the money because once this piece of work be release even though you pay 49 99 your go to have to pay a monthly payment just like the damn browser version 6 please read more review you can just tell who be human and who be not human all these false positive review be entirely short and must be die hard aq player if they truly believe this be a worth positive game however all the negative review just like mine be so much more believeable than the positive one anyone who truly like this game or edition of aq would try to speak more and give more of a review than just good game consider the game be get much more negative review than positive in addition us negative reviewer be not try to spam negative review like these short positive review conclusion terrible game major pay to win no content for f2p player no one be online only people who pay money actually play it no money no content no money no armor no money no weapon no money no pet no money no game,neg

early access reviewgreat game intuitive ui and smooth gameplay mix with the richness and strategy of a deep cardgame like mtg very free to play friendly allow you to quickly build a decent collection and a competitive deck frequent event and rebalance keep thing fresh without rely on release too many set too quickly,pos
generic clicker game that add a little more flavor and pleasing asthetic to the mix like most clicker game you have plenty of way to increase your coin click and idletime passive gain in this the difficulty curve be more pleasing because you start with a set of spell to jumpstart your game you gain monster coin on a chance per click basis and plenty of path for upgrade your coin gain pro f2p you can put money into the game but from what i gather you will not want to until high tier building much later on asthetically pleasing clicker open well enough so you can see your growth plenty of task that keep progression interestingcon no sound no music only the sound of my mouse click frantically long gap of wait time between progression at the end of the day it be just another clicker gametl dr 7 10one of the well clicker game out there right now imo it be not just a screen to click on yes it be but you can see progression and get your task do in a fairly reasonable amount of time like most clicker game just have a lot of patience and do not expect too much,pos

this game only work if you guy not have phone in all seriousness this game be dope a megaton of content and completely free it be complex and fun and instead of increase number value on set item every few month like blizzard do with diablo iii they actually make new and engaging content and release them as a new league completely free to everyone to play sure you can enhance your experience with extra stash tab or cosmetic if you want to but you be never bare from any activity in the game because you do not want to pay i highly recommend path of exile for people who love deep and engaging action rpg,pos
early access reviewok here be my review about this game the game itself be nice graphic and fun for combat and neat for tame pet and lot of other cool thing but hhis game be go to fail big time and there be only 2 reason for this reason number 1 you can not send mail to your friend reason number 2 you can not trade item to your friend these 2 thing be the most important function to have work in a mmorpg why would a game company make a mmorpg and include a mail system that only allow you to send mail to alternate character and when you right click on a friend who be in your party there be a trade with player option but when attempt to use it you get error message and it turn out the company who make bless online be not allow people to trade with their friend the trade be option be 100 disabled on purpose by the game company they say its to stop gold seller lmaothis game have a massive craft system and like any mmorpg there be always alot of people who love to trade stuff to their friend and family who play the game in order to help them level their crafting and or give them in game money to help them buy stuff as well as to avoid auction house fee if you can just sell directly to another player instead as well as craft ton of gear to give to their friend and family for free they say they do this to stop gold seller this do not stop gold seller at all as they can just ask the person who want to buy gold to put up a crap item on the auction house for a huge amount of gold which the gold seller will buy and this allow the person buy gold to get their gold this also prevent crafter from craft item to give to their friend or family unless they can somehow manage to buy it on the ah for a low price before someone else get it when try to help out friend and family with craft mat and or gear i find this be a game breaker for me me and 4 friend just get this game a few day ago and we all find out today we can not trade or mail each other so we all just quit the game right now they should just make this game single player game since you can not trade or mail your friend lmao this game be 100 doom to fail,neg

early access reviewthe graphic be really dope and well optimize the gameplay be clunky and the menu setting be lack but that s to be expect of ea strange humorous theme of man in their underwear with cook utensil for armor and ww2 gun kind of bizarre imo but okay why i dislike the game game launch in a seperate application when the match start so that s 3 app a launcher a menu and the actual game run do the dev not know how to put together a game next the client run in the background it launch when you start up your pc so i assume it instal some unwanted registry key that i do not give any consent to finally my desktop completely freeze up when i switch window to start up a recording the cursor be lock in place so i could not do anything and alt tabbing cause the window switching menu to freeze in the middle of my screen force me to reboot no thank do not want to deal with that again especially since i be in the middle of back up datum when it happen,neg
i probably have the less fun play this game than any other racing game to date i boot up the game and end up wait about 7 hour for the confirmation email to come so that i could activate my account and actually log into the game this be the reason for my 8 hour of play time while i leave the game minimize while wait for the email to come i be finally able to log in and be bombard with the cluster of a menu there do not seem to me to be any sort of rhyme or reason to how the menu be set up and the not so large amount of content be mask behind a seemingly endless menu which be all lock behind a paywall anyway once i get into what seem to be the only track available to me in what seem to be the only car available to me it take me a while to get use to not use a racing line in a game after ten lap or so i be finally able to race around the track decently quick but be conitinue to be annoy by the way the game play the physics seem decent enough but as far as be any fun it feel completely stale and uninteresting to me the only track available for free do not appeal to me at all and i do not care too much for the car either i be use a controller to race and the game still just feel really rigid stiff and so unexciting that after a couple more lap i decide that i be do with it the final product just feel to me well free they put a lot of focus on make the game seem quite real the game definitely have a unique feel to it that you notice all the way through but i be not go to give any of it a chance when the racing itself just leave me bore it kinda feel like a free version of gran turismo except not fun or good from head to toe it be just absolutely not visceral or exciting in the slight,neg

between two account i have log in arguably too much time i think its around 1800 hour what the be with 7 00 i agree with most the negative review of this new update they completely change what be already a great game they have a solid and diehard loyal group of player and 7 00 be like spit in our mouth and tell us its champagne i see what they be do valve want to appeal to a young generation of player that do not i repeat do not want to play dota 2 that be why they play league of legend or hero of the storm or smite they want a fast pace game that require little to no knowledge of tactic strategy or the game mechanic i use to say dota 2 be the chess of mobas difficult and require more skill to play than the checker of mobas like league now with 7 00 dota have become a checker moba give me back my tactical moba give us back our chess valve revert the change back to 6 88 and turn the change for 7 into dota 3 do noton your loyal player,neg

well its definitely more comfortable than the mobile version loading time be way short and it fit better on the screen if you have a big vault its somehow not very optimize vor pc especially regard control and setting but i also have minor graphical bug as well the game itself be the typical freemium wait or pay formula except that its a little bit less bad than most other of these game there be more thing to do and you will most likely unlock a lot by just play the gameplay mechanic be nothing new but it have some enhancement like take you to mission area that look different to gather loot i think the fallout universe fit very well for this type of game there be plenty of item place and other thing you know from fallout that give the game some depth so if chi ching slotmachine sound let you have the pleasure of achieve something in a videogame this be the game for you,pos
do not really know whether i should recommend this game or not cause it have big potential but the developer misstreate it you need money to unlock certain stuff not pay to win though and its really hard to get in get good equipment drop no matter if the stat be the one you need take longer than just buy what you want from well player it also do not get many update i would love to love this game but i can not,neg

if you like diablo like this one be free and really good so you should probably play it do not worry too much about the free2play aspect it be all cosmetic and additional tab for your stash the place in town where you store item if you be unfamiliar and those stash tab be cheap and you probably will not even need more than what they give you anytime soon it do a few interesting different thing from your typical diablo like for the most part you will feel like you be play diablo or grim dawn atmosphere and much of the gameplay or torchlight 2 gameplay some of those different interesting thing be as follow the active skill system which be similar to how materia work in final fantasy 7 your equipment have socket on it and you fit your skill gem into those socket if there be link socket you can place support gem in there and give the main skill additional effect such as add element damage piercing turn that skill into a trap that you throw on the ground instead of one that you actively cast etc it be a very neat way to help people build a character skill set to make it their own load of possibility the passive system similar to final fantasy 10s sphere grid do anyone else get the feeling that the dev have play a lot of ps1 2 era final fantasy again if you be unfamiliar i will try to explain every character class start out somewhere on this large kinda boardgame like matrix on the passive skill window this screen be full of these little node connect by path when you level up or complete certain quest and get a skill book you get a point to unlock a node each node grant something like more strength intelligence dexterity health mana mana regeneration attack speed etc there be also big node that usually grant several benefit at once and or a passive skill you have to follow the branch path from node to node around the board toward one that you want to get you can even choose to build your path toward other part of the board if you want some of the benefit of another character class one of the character class that you do not have access to early on start smack dab in the middle of the board allow them to branch out toward anything they desire the bartering system this one a little weird but it be a pretty neat idea basically there be no gold in this game but there be certain item in the world that both serve a practical purpose and be use as currency to trade with npc vendor for example a scroll of wisdom be use to identify your special item but it be also a form of currency these item be find in their whole form and in fragmented form the fragment automatically become a whole when you have enough of them when you sell stuff you get these currency item or at least fragment of them instead of money when you buy stuff you spend them want that frostbolt skill gem it will cost you one full scroll of wisdom anyway if you like this type of game there be really no reason not to try it it be free2play do right because you can have a full fun experience without spend a dime of real money or you can deck yourself out in purple flaming armor fairy wing and glow footprint that be up to you,pos
of write this review i can not really recommend this game i think it have a lot of potential but there be certain aspect that be really bothersome for myself pro great artwork a lot of fun option to personalize your build cute animal and charater design free to try 20 to upgrade to pro if you likecons constant lag spike and frame stutter nauseating jump animation especially bad with simultaneous lag spike lack of npc or npc village the game desperately need some life tame pet do not help in combat no buff attack or anything would be nice if they add this feature i think the artwork be great its much easy to look at than unmodded minecraft i like the ability to rotate block give you a lot more control over your buildssaw a guy make an ai tic tac toe game use the machine system they have like minecraft redstone the breaking point for me be the lag spike i can only assume it be due to their server or perhaps because they have not get to the polishing stage in their development i get lag spike and frame stutter constantly when i play and it have become almost nauseating if you pair that with the really bounce jumping animation its a pretty horrible experience i usually stay away from mountainous area because of this almost have to close my eye when i jump because of motion sickness they need to make the jumping animation smoother and figure out what s cause all these lag spike it seem like a hot topic and they say they be look into it but until its fix i personally can not play it perhaps other will not have any issue it would be cool if there be an option in the world setting that you could toggle to add sloped block to every edge of every block when the world be generate so you would not need to jump i do this to all the the block around my house because jumping be so unbearable it look and feel great like this so smooth running up and down surface the world desperately need some kind of npc village i know they be try to be different than minecraft but it be basically a minecraft copy and one of the great thing about minecraft be the npc village a little bit of a life in an otherwise bland game tame pet help you in combat would be great maybe limit it to a few or if they do not fight maybe they provide buff or useful utility like provide a light source or something this would add a fun dynamic to the game currently i just use them to farm material it be ok but perhaps they will add combat option for pet in the future more block option i would love to be able to use all those unique block like the thin snow top that sit on top of block in the snowy area would love to be able to place that on the roof or something perhaps i miss it i know they be work on a option to place item like food onto surface that would be a great addition and easy way to heat your home in cold environment other than put a fireplace or fire every 3 4 block i know a lot of people complain about the pro pack cost money but i honestly see the pro pack as the full game purchase you must pay 20 for minecraft and i understand pay 20 to unlock this game i think the creativerse model of try before you buy be a great idea game company need to make money somehow i get it you still get to play 80 of the game for free aside from the pro pack the only other stuff lock in the store be the cool texture pack like galactic and medieval and a few specialty item they be inexpensive to purchase you can build amazing thing without ever purchase these pack so until they fix the lag spike and jumping animation i personally can not recommend this game if and when they manage to fix it i would be happy to upgrade to pro and continue play,neg
17 hour into it overall i be happy with it one of the big thing about it be that there be a big learning curve but once your past that it be a very fun game so as long as you can have some patient the tutorial need some work it be not always clear with its direction and some arrow point to thing would be nice since it just describe what thing look like in the cockpit there be some thing that they describe that fit multiple thing the control can take get use to but after a while its fine for the most part but there be a lot of control and find a part of control can be difficult sometimes another compliant i have be i feel that a lot of the price for dlc should be low or to at least bundle more thing i find out they raise some price earlier this summer by 10 and even 20 the original price be more reasonable my finale complaint be it crash more than it probably should i have a decent computer that can run it at a consistent 60fps on low and medium graphic the freeze seem to come out of nowhere i also have some low fps and freeze that happen for a short time when fire weapon but this for some reason do not happen anymore at the moment a 7 10,pos

in short its a moba with spaceship so if you like moba or space action there be very little chance not to like it in my personal opinion it get the well version both genre as a moba its lane be not fill with ai control creep rather the lane be control by the player so the player have the all the control over the game and as a spaceship game it have spaceship with proper and detailed space aesthetic and game mechanic by the way the game may feel bit slow at the beginning as the ship seem to move slowly even jet also seem to move slowly when we see it in relation to sky but game play be quite fast because average match length be 10 20min if its not then either both team be really very good or horribly bad,pos
this game suck it be like dayz but a cheap knock off version typical free to play pay to win trash full of microtransaction the graphic be terrible the combat be even bad and there be no stealth when it come to zombie as they chase you regardless of whether or not you be sneak the map be also extemely basic and you have to pay in order to access server with any good loot the only possitive i can think of be the vault where you can stash the loot you pick up along the way which be kind of make redundant because the gun be all pretty much the exact same bottom line you get what you pay for,neg

there be a number of quality about this game that make it endearing even to long time player of fps game it do have a very stylized look cartoon like and its gameplay be not an attempt to realistically simulate combat but because the game utilize multiple class each with different ability team fortress 2 create a diverse range of gameplay scenario the acquisition of item be a rather entertain little meta game in itself essentially it be a shooter that can allow player on oppose team to strategize and adapt their play as they see fit with some player prefer scout sniper medic or engineer role among other the diversity of player choice help keep the game fresh even long after you have play every map and scenario if you enjoy teamwork shooter game it may be worth a look,pos

early access reviewafter play both magic the gathering and hearthstone i have to say eternal card game ecg game be a great blend of the two although i love mtg for its in depth strategy fun limited drafting style and the game mechanic the reality be that the game be expensive and take a lot of time to enjoy hearthstone land on the other end of the spectrum it be cheap easy to play but lack the depth that mtg have eternal card game have blend the two very well and be a fantastic edition to the space the free to play mechanic be awesome it be easy to amass a large number of card that you can then use to build a competetive deck while enjoy the game without feel like you be grind the ai be good albeit easy to beat if you undersatnd how it make decision also competeive multiplayer drafting be really well do in ecg and requie the amount of thought skill of a mtg draft for player who be not use to in depth mechanic and strategy heavy ccg this game do have a much steep learning curve than a game like hearthstone however the pay off be very rewarding,pos
look at this game at first i could not for the life of me figure out how it would be entertaining to be honest it look stupid and boring boy be i wrong it be basically a puzzle memory type of game where you learn how to take apart and reassemble real weaponery once i find out what the game have to offer i be hook i find it quite good and a little addicting it be very casual too hop in for 5 minute or 1 hour it be not like most game out there that really impose on your time to get something do the game be free you only start with one gun but it be easy to get point to unlock other gun so it be no where near a pay2play i have around 11 gun now and enough point to probably buy two more gun depend on what i want i actually feel quite guilty because i have not yet pay for on of the pack the game do offer which be around 10 i mean it be so cool of a game that i would like to support the development team i do not know if this review will help much but if you get anything from it learn from my mistake i think the game be stupid look and almost pass it by but once i try it i find out how great it be do not make my mistake at the very least yoou can learn how to take apart and then put back together an ak47 assault rifle or colt 45 handgun,pos

to start i should say that war thunder have be a positive influence on my life overall when the community be good it be great i have form many last friendship and i be currently in a relationship of almost a year with someone i meet through the game but war thunder have a problem with woman not all player be like that not even the majority but enough s be loud enough to ruin the experience for so many girl i know and we as a community can do better i be a woman i like to play comp and i get on voice to make call out and provide encouragement for the most part it be fine and we all have a good time except when the enemy j1 somehow get me every push but there be time when teammate get toxic in a way that do not get apply to male player and sometimes the very presence of a female voice in the chat be enough to set people off it be not funny when you ask me if i will send nude or if i will perform an obscene act for you even if you be joke it be really not funny i promise it be grate to be continually ask if i be a bomber main since i be a girl or for you to demand that i pocket you i do not play bomber sorry how about naval plane it be especially not funny to be harass to have people make video of them troll me and to receive dozen of hateful message after to be tell to kill myself to be call a bimbo and aand much much bad i have block people who then make multiple account to continually harass me when play with my girlfriend we have be call all kind of sexist epithet plus an extra helping of homophobia when they find out we be date and despite all this i still get on mic and speak partly because i be not about to let a few sweaty manchildren ruin my gaming experience but partly because it be more than just me time and time again i have have other girl timidly get on mic when they hear my voice and express their relief at hear another girl they say they do not usually talk out of fear but that it be nice to hear a friendly voice people say that there be not any girl gamer but that could not be furth from the truth you have just create a climate where they be too scared to talk because many of them have experience the same thing as me i know most of you be decent people i be lucky to have a close circle of player who be talented kind people but we as a community need to do a well job of stand up against this kind of poor behavior more than just report it when you see it although i wholly recommend do that make it know that you do not tolerate sexist conduct even a simple hey man that be not cool can both 1 let the harasser know that their behavior be not condone and 2 let the harassee know that decent people do exist the silence of complicity and the silence of dissent sound the same speak up to make your true color shine so please be mindful foster an environment that welcome female player and do not forget to bomb the airfield eta thank for the mostly supportive response i appreciate it it mean a lot to me that the average person still know how to be polite like i say it be the good egg who make this community what it be a couple people have say thing akin to this be the internet grow a thick skin etc i be well aware of how the internet can be and i do have a tremendously thicc skin as a result it be not me i be worried about a lot of people do not have such a thicc skin and it be those girl who be not as harden as i be who really suffer just because i be a harden shrew do not mean we all have to be people have also say thing akin to if you do not want to be subject to homophobic harassment when you be play with your girlfriend you should not announce to people that you guy be date aside from put the blame on me which i think be unfair i do not think these people understand the dynamic at play it be not like i announce to everyone hey guy this be my girlfriend we be date although i really ought to because she be a phenomenal woman what generally happen be one of us will refer to other as babe during a game e g nice pilot knockout babe then someone ask if we be date and then all hell break loose also every person who respond to this post with shut up bomber just prove my point i know you think you be hilarious but you be not go to get a comedy special for your scathing wit,neg

okay so do not get me wrong it be a really fun game in all honesty with friend it be even better meet some cool people here too but i honestly can not recommend this game to anyone take my actual game time remove about 30 hour and that be how much i actually play because the launcher be utter cancer second the game be horribly optimize i have to play something that look pretty much like morrowwind style graphic yet it still have almost no frame and my pc be really not that bad because i play game that look ton well but run ton well too you can not really do all that much without spend either totally insane ammount of time playing or spend money you be limit to 2 character unless you buy more slot or spend hour upon hour to get enough stuff to sell and then convert the diamond into zen etc etc bla bla i really give this game my everything and no matter how much i want to love this game i just could not because there be way too many issue gameplay be awesome and so be the story and overall lore and i honestly love these but like i say just way too many issue for me to recommend this game to anyone if you have get a beast of a pc with way too much time and or money on your hand pick the game up and enjoy otherwise goodluck actually play,neg
the young and slightly undeveloped sibling of world of warcraft that describe it perfectly neverwinter be a free rpg game which hold great adventure a magnificent graphic quality impressive voice act and immersive story do not like pay for your game but expect year of effort put into a game just for you to play then you have come to the right place young jedi this game hold a great community that surprisingly pass as the good community experience i have see in the last few year even though this game be free for some reason it do not attract 12 year old such as some other game do cough of course it be not a perfect masterpiece when it come to pvp and inventory management but come on it be a free game that you would probably still pay a considerable amount of money if it be price everything in the game be obtainable by farming and spending time there be no pay 2 win associate with this game of course there be pay 2 advance faster but it be totally up to you if you like the game therefore you decide if you would like to support the developer or not with a little buck i rate this game 8 10 because it could have be well though i believe that it be engine do not allow it and it be a little repetitive once you have get the basis of it do not hesitate on play this game it be definitely worth a try but hear from me it could bring addiction play safe,pos

early access reviewthis be a moba game with big spaceship and even big potential whether the developer will achieve that potential be another matter but they be definitely on the right track if the premise sound appealing to you you will enjoy the game and it be worth the price of admission it be very well do however it be early access and as such there be a lot of miss function some balance issue bug and a lack of content which appear to be in the process of be address my big concern at the moment in term of i want to have fun right now be the lack of tooltip detail let me explain you get choice on which weapon ability to load your ship with however there be absolutely zero description of what any of the weapon do aside from the name so you kind of have to try them all and figure out how they be suppose to work yes this will obviously be address but in the game current state there be sort of an unnecessarily high learning curve still once i figure thing out i start have a ton of fun and i be glad i pay the 10 i be have fun find new way to sneak up on enemy and blow them to piece,pos
early access reviewthis game be the same as any other collectible card game out there it start as f2p friendly and turn into p2w it will only get bad with time they will rotate out the card that you buy or earn in one year or two from standard play and they will force you to buy the new content every three month like hearthstone do these game be scam they never intend to make it f2p so stay away from this garbage,neg
this game so addictive i like itgood to play with your friend but too much grind its not good for my poor brain and body and lack of side mission and hard to find something to do beside beat dungeon or mining like mad man server only alvalable in eu na and pts us its a bit laggy and delay in my country make its hard to play,neg

i love this game for about 4 day straight then as i play and learn more i discover the downside mana it seem like just an annoyance at first but it become a pattern i either have too much or not enough many game of just sit there pass my turn and be unable to do anything i can not recommend this game to any one you be go to love it only to find out it have aids and the dev want it that way,neg
thehunter be thepaytohavefun game as much as i would like to recommend a hunting game that be this open and support multiplayer it take way too much time and effort to be able to do anything but hunt mule deer when you first start out you can only hunt mule deer and rabbit the trick be that you do not have a gun to hunt rabbit with instead you have to earn currency by hunt mule deer in a couple different challenge and competition which do not give you enough currency to do much at all even if you do paytohavefun it be for a limited time that you can access all the animal license and a limited time to acess all the hunting ground the only thing you get to keep be the item and gun and you have to keep hunt to get more currency to keep buy ammo for the gun you want to keep use except for the start gun,neg
i think this game be one to watch it really be a very high quality racing simulator especially consider it be free a little too far down the realism spectrum for my liking though the main problem be that there be no sense of accomplishment or incentive to keep play in most racing game you win race to unlock new track and car which keep you want to play on but here you unlock new stuff by buy it also the race them self be just against the clock there be very little sense of accomplishment from just move a few place up the leader board so as i say i think this be one to keep an eye on as more content become available,pos

although you do need to invest some money to get the most enjoyment out of this game as you can it be definitely worth it as an avid hunter for over ten year now i never think i would find a video game that could come close to what the great outdoors be like with each and every update thehunter inch closer and closer to this mark actually it hit that mark a long time ago and just get close towards absolute perfection the only thing a person really need to buy be a weapon or two or ten or thirty just so you have the ability to hunt every animal you need compatible weapon if you do mission and grind a bit you can do this completely free to play but it can be discourage and see a large or trophy animal or even a rare variant appear before you and know you can not take that trophy due to license restriction would be disheartening so really the only money anyone should spend would be on a subscription which for a year be well price in my opinion especially if you do the trailblazer pack that come with plenty of weapon and camouflage at this point it just become a game you pay once for and it be like you be buy dlc if you really like it you have the weapon and gear permanently and if you play that year you purchase you should have enough gm to renew license and ammunition on top of everything it be multiplayer single lobby do exist but be able to hunt with a friend and scout together or compete for the large trophy it be just load of fun even count down from 3 1 so you both can take down trophy simultanaeously it be just great overall,pos

i have return to the game after the big recent patch and i be really enjoy it again i have not play for quite a while before rejoin probably a year plus immediately after the patch there be a problem drag card which have now be patch you seem to need to drag them by the bottom half but meh easy enough to make that mental change until they fix it fully which i be sure they will great gameplay can play a quick game or two for 20 minute or lose hour in it seem resonably balanced most card have counter if you build a deck with some thought you can ponder over card combination for many hour too without even play a hand just honestly can not see the hate be deserve turn that frown upside down barf the dev of course need to take into account the feeling of player and i be sure they will and give it a month or two to get patch back up and i hope that mostly negative in recent review will turn positive i love the clever emote system too though it be a tiny tad limited would be good to see that expand a bit so anyhow i look forward to see you in game where i will kill you without mercy but will make sure i do it politely,pos
optimization be bad as hell crash and freeze very often and the bad of all that the developer do not give a after couple of mounth they give away couple of dll file to put in the game directory to prevent crash on a top ati video card but it cause random fps drop in the game all the time developer move forward realy slow they be just release more and more plane but do not improve quality,neg

smite be way well than lol no offense to lol community i think this game be just a little more fun for me than lol anyways if you be new then i would say play arena or joust my favorite game mode be mainly joust and i love the game so much ever since i find out about it i mainly love playing as anubis go figure and neith 3 anubis be pretty broken with how much damage he can dish out and i love it lol i want to write this just to tell people how much fun the game be and how much i recommend this game i think the main reason why i love it more be because of the third person angle camera it have and that be a deal breaker for me i mainly play this on xbox one please do not hurt me c pc be well yes but i love play this more on console but i think this game be lovable no matter what it be a great game mainly to play with friend who you know will not let you down and die everytime they run out into the battlefield good luck and i hope this review help anyone who want to play this game,pos

due to all the negativity surounde this game i want to say my point my name be babyface and by my hour you may guess that i love this game the problem people have with this game be that they think it be another pay to play win game however it be much like the situation with call of duty black op 3 it be pay to add more playability or fun to the game with game witch give the option to pay it be just their way of ask if you want to support their game i have spend roughly 20 on this game and that be on a pack of cubit and the chloromanser pack sorry if spelt wrong i do get the point that people have spend more money on the game on it than me but do not go attack the dev of this game just because your account get wipe if it be due to the bandwagon of account wipe then you should have play on it more if it be due to an attack on your account then it be a cause of concern the dev can not really do anything about that which i be sorry to hear about it however if it be refund in their currency then there be not a problem on other game similar to this one this have happen to me and the support do not help however with really supportive dev i think that they will do anything they can do my overall conclusion do not give the devsif you lose your item and they could not retreave it however if you feel personally that they do jack carry on complain this game be subjective and you can like it one second and despise it the next i love the game and i think more people should play it however thati just my opinion thank you for read for those who do not want to read this just watch this instead cause it be pretty funny,pos
early access reviewthis use to be an amazing game but now it be just another pay to win seek out money from premium player withen the recent overhaul the both overpowered and overpriced weapon such as seek rocket and aa make fly in general a nightmare hopefully the dev will balance it out a little more before robocraft be a complete game good luck to anyone who be not a tryhard or a premium player i truly like this game but will only rate it bad due to these issue no hard feeling,neg
excellent game i much prefer this to minecraft its fun to build and its fun to explore there be a great selection of block some available as dlc but i have be play for year and still have not finish buide everything i want with the block that come free the game look great for a block game make wander and explore very fun there be a day night dynamic to the monster you can encounter but they can not dig and never blow up your building so early on you can easily avoid monster you be not ready to encounter yet it have a few bug but they be easily overshadow by the fact that this game be fun i have play this for 130 hour so far which be about 100 hour more than any other game i have ever own,pos
i be very thrilled to play this game after watch the film and series but this game be very disappointing most of the new dragon that have be introduce in the series be only for member only they say that nothing be for free these day yet when i use to play game nothing be that hard to get but these day its cash cash cash its very disapointing but let me shed some light on this game before i get to the huge down fall this game be go to be mostly recommnede to the fan of the how to train your dragon this game style and design look a lot like the style of the series that be currently on netflix the character of the main cast be in it and help you along the way you even get to meet their dragon as well the area of the game change to the current season which be nice and you can recognize a lot of the area you get to raise your dragon from a baby to its adult form very cute and you get to choose the colour but you can not fly for a very long time remind me of istaria the animation mechanic be ok a little buggy but not bad now here be the down fallssometime when exit the area the loading screen will come up it will nag you to get a membership it will take a while to get to the next area once it do it will appear again before you can move on and do your quest or task around the area sadly sometimes when you say no to the membership the game will crash i struggle to get out of this on wide screen so if any of you have a pc that struggle to run these type of game please keep it on window just incase it decide to crash on you after the crash i decide to check the review sadly all the negative be right you take a few step and it already crash on you exit an area to another it will crash go fishing it will lag so much as well as when you chop down tree for wood it will lag so bad that your game will crash and freeze your pc another reason to keep it on window unfortunatly i have to get rid of the game due to the graphic and lag on the game it crash 3 time load it back up be more quick than get around the area do not play this game if you do not want your pc to suffer from crash and freezesplay this game on window just to be safebut overall i highly recommend you to not play this game its need much more work because it still look like its in testing it look very much like the old graphic from a very old console let say ps1 sort of style yes i know that sound very harsh but its true it also need more free stuff than just membership stuff the lag make it very frustrating to play because you can hardly go anywhere i be very disappointed in this game but if your little one would like to play it make sure your pc can run alright on it and keep it on window just be on the safe side but do not be surprised if it crash on window screen as well,neg

game mechanic be rough and not very responsive which make the combat very anticlimatic and remove the immersive feeling of be in a war the visual be decent but also do not create the immersive environment and look very fake i be not say that every game have to be realistic but since the creator have take this route they should put more work into that i have to say the developer have leave quite a few setting to suit your need but for my opinion there be more con than pro,neg

out of the gate its a fun and addictive game however after about a week of fairly heavy play its flaw shine through the game really become an over complicated coin flip simulator heavily base on luck sure a core part of these card game be luck but this game be excessively luck base because of its design flaw 1 there be very limited and straight forward strategy that pretty much begin and end with produce unit to attack the enemy give them equipment to make them hit harder and then produce unit that destroy or stop them or really cheap simple kill card to stop them that be pretty much all the game offer strategically 2 the automatic mana aspect which start low and grow each turn be part of the problem as it take out an entire important strategic aspect of card game be resource and its management so most game will proceed through a rather mundane same old same old start until each player hit 6 mana at the same time at which point luck of the draw will determine the outcome my unit out mash down your avatar or your spam of guard unit plus kill card stop me with only an extremely small sample of counter card that typically be limit to silence or remove guard or unit with guard or instant kill card include silence so most deck be just zerg just flood the board with cheap unit that buff stat of each other and overwhelm outdraw each other while no resource make initial learn curve really small in the end it destroy the game as it also preclude any real depth of gameplay and strategy so it get boring repetitive luck of the draw really fast take a week of 3 4 hour a day play before it set in for me since eventually both player have plenty of mana to play super card and well its just luck if you draw the 2 4 super card of your 50 before i do 3 the comeback mechanic of break rune to get draw be another very flawed mechanic that again just reduce the game down to raw luck at first it seem really quit cool then you realize it just penalize you for win completely negate a entire deck strategy often refer to as burn deck just focus on kill the avatar but it get even further compound by prophecy card which be card you auto get to play for free if the opponent break a rune a comeback mechanic be great but not this iteration since there be no strategy now if you have to have the resource aka mana to use the prophecy card then you may have a strategic asset to gameplay but its not it just turn the game even more to a basic luck of the draw maybe if they refine this to be strateigc it would add to the game but right now it simply remove it 4 finally the game balance turn to crap because in the end most of the truly powerful card in these type of game have extraordinary play cost make them a risky choice and difficult to bring into play but with the ever automatically increase mana per turn this no longer apply so once we hit 9 10 mana if you draw your supercard which be wildly powerful due to its mana cost you win i lose if i draw it i win you lose because the card at so insanely powerful for example a card may have 10 dmg 10 defense and when it come into play it automatically do 4 6 dmg to every unit in this game most unit have 1 4 hp so it wipe the board and now you have a 10 10 unit that your only hope be a luck draw to to stop it since all your unit just perish gg win to auto loss via pure random luck with no way to control zero counter play so until they add more card with actual interesting mechanic and if they tweek some poorly design mechanic right now this be a basic deathmatch heavily base on luck which be the antithesis of what make these card game fun so it start off fun but before long it become bland and boring af do not get suckere into buy pack off your initial experience give it some solid game like 50 100 normal before you truly have a feel for the game,neg
early access reviewthis be a great game for early access i would recommend this game to anyone that be a fan of fps game it be fun fast paced and entertain the only few downside to this game be the lack of european and or british server and the lack of controller support i really like the concept that each match you need to purchase weapon with currency you gain from kill enemy the only downside be the fact that everyone start the match with 2000 and that defeat the point as you have enough to purchase a weapon there also need to be a party aspec in this game so you can join a party with your friend and start a match i enjoy this game for what it be and i be excited for the change that be add in it be developement in the early access stage,pos

trove be a classic grind mmo with an option to fast forward the grinding with real money the game be fun the different class lend some diversity to an otherwise routine game the enemy balance well with the player level and the game be pace so as to offer the player a reward at interval that make it fun and keep the game feeling like an adventure one of the great feature be the cornerstone your own plot of ground that you can build and outfit as you see fit and move with you as you move from biome to biome the downside be that grind mmo require functional server to enjoy and the developer can not seem to maintain a server or push a patch successfully to save their life in the past two week since i begin play with 48 5 hrs on record there be not a day that pass without the server go down disruption of less than an hour or 2 do not make the forum i think the dev see them as common but look at the forum you can see that the server go down for long period at approximately 2 day interval to playfun biome to exploreblock buildingmobile home basecon server be down regularlyenemie and boss lack varietygame play be repetitive,neg

although a decently entertaining little card game currently the ring of magica be overpower to the point where you will lose any game against a decent not new start player if you start 1st serious balancing be require on that point also the prophecy system annoy the live daylight out of me possibly due to the fact that my hero refuse to pull prophecy card when his rune be break and in stead pull them on his turn make them less effective or fun to use while my opponent seem to have none of these issue but that be rng i guess as the game hardly bring something new to the table i do not see it compete with hearthstone and with gwents release closing in i have a feeling legend will not be around very long,neg

a game with a good concept combat system and character class design and have potential but have horrible optimization and player friendly setting on top of that target mode be different for class some have action and other have classic which be autistic for two reason 1 already it change the gameplay for each person drastically how can you make pvp like this even if a targeting mode would not work for a system make a work around that be fari for player 2 it be well for each person to choose the targeting mode they want test them out maybe swap between them rather than force it onto them make for a more friendly system and well gameplay,neg

this game have good production its smooth look good sound good be fun be addictive be pay 2 win i finish the story in about 5 hour it be pretty interesting then they thow you right into competition you have a couple of choice but everything either cost gold to enter or be against other player the problem with the first be that gold be what you need to buy card but if you lose you get nothing so its a 50 50 actually its weighted way against you if you only have starter deck that you may even get enough gold to advance however after a few round the house will win and you will be stick grind in casual mode against other player again if you lose you get nothing you be fight people who have well card than you because they buy them and when you lose you get nothing i do not mind a grind but this be not a grind it be a pay wall do not play this game if you do not want to spend money on it do yourself a favor and see the playtime on all the other review you will quickly notice that those who give it a positive rating be still in story mode under 5 6 hour and those who give it a negative rating start hit that wall 7 10 hour,neg

early access review4 hour of lag 1 of reach level 5 switch to mage and reach 6 just to experiance unplayable lag for 4 hour i could not do anything almost 5min to buy a full green starter set from the vendor 10min to equip it quest take 1 3min to notice i reach the destination and a quest bug for me although i believe this be due to the ammount of player on the eu server i be not able to experiance any combat or the game at all due to this and i refund the game if it be price today will be 10 15 euro or 20 euro with taxis include i will most likely buy it again but if not then i can just say that this game be t 40 for a game that never recieve any update more than content and the combat that be definitely a scam twice if not almost thrice it be actual cost if you experiance fps issue then this will be it for you,neg

let me be clear this game take some serious getting use to you will be lose for the first several hour and even after that figure out how you fit into your team overall objective be go to be difficult i have the major benefit of join a platoon a group of squad and squad leader work together under the command of a platoon leader early on and do so go a long way towards help me understand how to play the game well as an indavidual you must decide what role you want to fill in the game and how it can best benefit your team this mean pick a class and stick to it for the most part for those of you who think immediately i want to snipe some word of caution you will be kill counter snipe and push around a lot in the begining your kill count will be low and firefight will be overwhelm the scope of this game be massive and unlike a certain overly popular gaming franchise on console cough cod cough just because you have a sniper rifle do not mean you be go to be a headhunting god out the gate battlefield esqe bullet drop and highly limited breath holding capability will see to that you will likely be outperform by hard scoper if you try to play the quickscope game here long weapon rechamber and reload time will ensure that why because this game do not feel that every soldier on the battlefield be equal headshot can not kill every target in one hit especially depend on the rifle you use with a fair few require two or more hit to kill regardless of where you hit your target at a range beyond 400 meter only the high powered weapon will drop target in one shoot only one faction specific weapon have the damage output to headshot most target in one hit at any range downside it have a trigger delay and that will throw your shot way off target start to sound unfair welcome to planetside where every faction have very distinct pro and con to its equipment set and ability for those of you who prefer to be in the thick of the fight prepare to be outflank double team and own by vehicle en masse your k d be go to hurt in the begining no two automatic weapon be equal in any way find one that work well for you and stick to it with all of this say this game be not newbie friendly veteran player will have a more diverse set of weapon well implant and know many of the nook and cranny you may try to hide in advantage be the layout of each continent have change a few time over the year so there be plenty of spot yet to be use frequently this game be somewhat p2w allow you to use real money to get that shiny new weapon a lot faster however with the exception of a few differently colored weapon iteration whose stat be exactly the same as the base model nothing in this game be unobtainable by simply play the game but it be a grind as be every mmo ever make still sound like your kind of challenge welcome to the battle for auraxis pick your side pick your gun and strap yourself in you be not in kansas anymore,pos
my advice do not play it its go from experiment use ur creativity to pay to win lol free to win my also the game base have go toit use to be make bot that have good base and just pick ur weapon and play style now it like infinite warfare than ever before i miss the games basic mechanic that make it unique and now its just a no skill blockbath for anyone say that no i be very skilled ur wrong try play this game when it just come out yeah then we can talk the removal of the tech tree make game really unbalanced and add bunch of t into low tier game this be free to play but 100 not win from this i can tell that the developer be just money hog and do not care bout the community makerobocraftgreatagain,neg
early access reviewso i be actually enjoy this game or rather i should say i really want to do not seem pay to win keep in mind i only have 2 hour play i finish the campaign sometimes lose pointlessly because i could not draw sigil and do my first gauntlet run i be excited to see what this gamemode would be the idea of play to win well reward to meet an ultimate boss and get the final tier prize be entice anyway i lose my first match instantly and that end my run because i draw no sigil ok so by now i have unlock rank play be a veteran hearthstone player i choose to create a mid lategame red green focused deck and jump into rank lose my first two match because i only draw 1 2 sigil great i amoff but after i believe my first match i get a premade deck provide to me by the game for play a rank match great seem like a good and balanced deck earlygame focus but with control aspect and card that provide you with sigil awesome maybe this will solve my problem of sigil lack eh by this moment i be severelyoff at rng i go on to play 2 match with this deck and lose both time because i can not for the love of ing draw sigil anyway i go on to play my last placement match for rank with the premade justice deck which i have have luck in the campaign with i also enjoy the aggressive creature focus playstyle of it needless to say the earlygame go great i draw 3 sigil of justice and play them this get me a huge lead in the earlygame i continue to press my opponent he be at around 2 health however through the entire game i have not draw a single sigil and draw card which cost 4 6 power this game mana currency at this moment my enemy have 8 sigil power and whilst i be overdraw on card because i can play nothing he be reactively play and actually engage with the game he drop a legendary and basically pound me into oblivion from 2hp because i legitimately can not play the game i have never experience more consistent bad rng in the game the game need a serious bad luck protection system or provide a better more concrete way of draw playing sigil just realise i have not explain what those be they be a prerequisite for play alligned card in this game like magic land it be a disgusting feeling have to concede game in campaign because you realise in the 3rd 4th turn you be go to lose and then go on to rank multiplayer and realise you can not concede or you lose rank play and getoff because you redrew your start hand into the minimum amount of sigil 5 time in a row and you draw no more and you can do nothing for the entire game obviously my opponent do not experience the same bad luck so this may just be me or the strong deck be those build around 1 sigil requirement card draw 1 power cost card but this may just be me be extremely unlucky so take my review with a healthy proportion of salt if you think i have not provide enough,neg

early access reviewthis game be extremely fun even with all the complaint about the developer remove the crafting of legendary weapon they do that decision to make the game feel less like a race to craft one i admit it can be frustrating to loose a gunfight because your opponent happen to get a fire stone spear from the chest they be hide next to a simple solution could be to put them in the air drop instead of basic chest the game be update regularly and the devleoper listen to their community for an alpha this game be go very smoothly there be a few bug but that be what be to be expect when you play an alpha game people who complain about balance and bug need to realise that be what they should expect when download a game before release especially one in alpha tl dr the game be fun and free download this unique br and give it a go to form your own opinion edit they re add the ability to craft craft calss legendary weapon as well as now the ability to craft any legendary weapon,pos

early access reviewok so what to say about this game first of all its free 2 play but it be not pay2win if you like game like magic the gathering hearthstone or dual of champion you will love this game most of the mechanism be adapt version of mtg mechanism e g hast first strike trample which mean the game be of course optimize for online playing balance the interaction between player card game and the game flow in a optimal way it be possible to interact with card and action the opponent do in his turn but it be minimize in a way to have a good feeling about the game flow it be not that it seem to always interrupt with every action you can take it be possible to play all the game provide without pay any money or invest hundret of hour to get free gold after 2 3 day it be possible to build a free 2 play deck that be competetive enough for the low rank one thing that have to be mention negativ be the force to play the complete campaign aka kind of tutorial which take several hour to get the basic deck of each color and before it be possible to play gauntlet long story short a very good online game for every mtg player,pos
ah classic old team fortress 2 there really just be nothing like it it have team base combat unlockable weapon and most important of all hat but forget about that for just a second what make this game so good the humour of this game be just amazing every class have something nasty to say about each other and you would know what i be talk about if you play the game or watch the meet the trailer teaser series it just make me smile when i hear a line i have never hear before secondly the team base combat as with most modern day fpss with the exclusion of the battlefield series somewhat you do not see a lot of team orient gameplay take for example call of duty it be really just a run and gun experience and that be not what teamwork really be about in tf2 though it really require a good deck of card for you to win you need to work together to capture the control point get the intelligence push the cart and etc it can get rather intense with either your team or the other team try to do a push that be one aspect that i love about tf2 next the unlock drop system with game such as call of duty you need to level up in order to gain new weapon and attachment for your current weapon but with tf2 no need they drop randomly every weapon have its advantage and disadvantage make them virtually balanced either way but do note that these be only side grade not overall upgrade from your stock weapon your stock weapon be just as effective as your new weapon but droppable weapon do have stat bonus and stat drop that your stock weapon do not have every unlockable weapon be suituational to some degree so it be important to plot out which weapon you will use the thing you have be wait for hat while not all that important hat do add some flair to the game they give you customization option to your class which can often result in a rather spectacular look player to not only look at but play as but how do you get hat it be somewhat complicated really standard unique quality hat drop rather rarely but you can get them from unlock crate or trading you can get genuine hat by order a game that have a special compaign that give you the hat for free if you buy that game then there be the real meat of this whole hat thing the holy unusual hat yes they be rare and expensive to obtain but they give you a feeling of satisfaction and achievement once you do get one for the first time especially if you unbox one that be rather hard to do on the first try but hat do not add anything special to the game really same with stranges and killstreak weapon they only track your kill obvious difference be that stranges track your lifetime kill while killstreak weapon count how many kill you get in one life but yes i do recommend this game it be a nice game to play for a few hour and hopefully find something new to do that you never do before,pos

basically the good arpg hack n slash that keep refine the genre you do not even need to play this game to know how important it be but i personally do not find it fun to play just my opinion still if you have the patience of replay the same thing over and over in order to progress then go for it you also need to play it seriously not just use everything you find you can not do that because this game force you to learn theorycrafte character building in order to end every act and keep progress in the game this basically apply in every game of the same genre but poe be more strict about it so get ready once you start have fun,pos

early access reviewthis game be really fun until the update come around now you get thing from drop you get the currency by sell the thing from the drop this game be one of my go to game now i do not even know what to say about it update this game have some serious potential before tier make game fun as you would play with people with around the same weapon so you would not get 1 shot currency be not impossible to come by and everybody could get to the same weapon now it be down to if you get a good enough drop which you can sell to get a decent weapon the dev pretty much say you want a lot of currency either sell your soul to this game or pay us for the currency freejam go straight money hungry with no regard to what the community be say,neg
early access reviewlove the game be be so nice when it come out have some bug but nothing massive other then potion but that just make it where you have to push someone so they can not heal up now its just a cancer grow last friday be forge up that make them lose half the player base they have now this week so far they lose another half of the player base we will see how many return on monday tuesday but i do not get why they do not use there brain when do update and why they keep try to force major update sadly i would not recommend play this game due to the unstable develpment team and lack of common sense need to make a game better not bad,neg

early access reviewnow this game use to be a lot of fun it have a solid economy and pretty much work as advertize you build a vehicle and then you battle it out in different match type you would get reward even more with premium and with the reward currency you could buy new part for your vehicle i be write it use to because the developer decide to promote their premium strong and thus change the economy model to a random drop system this at the begining may be fun but soon you notice that you can not just buy the stuff you need to build your robot you would have to recycle your previous reward in order to get a fraction of their wealth back as robit with which you could buy your desire item then this mean the game have develop away from it be initial freedom and appeal of a building game to just farm a bit and then buy and build what ever you wish into a total gamble you be now totally dependent on luck with your drop and every time you get a loot crate you be offer additional random drop as premium player this basically go entirely against the initial freedom the game be advertize for there be more issue right now unbalanced weaponsystem and even very old glitch they never really get to fix them but the general trend regard this game strongly point towards become a moneygrab there be lot of problem which be solve absolutely nicely before the epic loot update for example since everyone want the protonium crate now people be play also against their own team for the top spot on the leaderboard result in team not play together anymore also seal clubbing have become really common bring high endgame weapon into low lever match to become the topscorer and thus also get reward with the protonium crate that be right there be no difference right now wether you win a match on your level or low level do not matter you get the same totally random generate protonium crate which have the high chance to give you some legendary item in theory but these chance be still so slim it be almost always random crap as well as in the other box so enjoy the game as long as you do but i can not recommend get to invest in it be current state,neg
yet another game which start very good and now come into the state of pay 2 win or get out i do not rememebr how many hour i do play i would need to reinstal to check although i do not think i can be bother i go through plane because i be wait for introduction of tank compare to wot visual in wt be amazing and it be promise at the beginning so then thing just happen firstly russian stuff become well than any other stuff same thing with plane and then tank ok russian tank be not too bad during wwii but let us be honest other be not so much bad anyways wt be not a simulation but an arcade game with some sort of reality approach therefore some sort of the balance would be require to make sure that player will use all osrt of stuff to play not only t 54 i still remember wot when chinese type 59 be introduce map full of this small bugger nowhere to play in wt thing start to be similar for me even bad i be wait for british tansk because i love british tank i know stupid me in wt those be mopst of the time unplayable and now the pay to win part i do not feel i need to explain too much really if you be not sure what i be talk about try without premium account go therough level 4 to level 5 in british tank really any tank i love the game i be too tired and disappointed to install it again even to check how the ship be go,neg

early access reviewprobably the good alternative to super smash bro out there right now and with it be smooth in term of movement more responsive and available for free on pc the only real thing smash have over it be diversity familiar character and complexity the weapon system however be not flawless and although i like the idea of a character have 2 optional weapon they all function the same besides three special move that resemble smash attack from smash bros you have up neutral forward and downwards which be about the only difference between character besides choice of weapon overall though this game be a lot of fun to play and if you do need a smash alternative to play with friend out of either not want to emulate smash and play through netplay or just not own a wii u 3ds this game be definitely worth get,pos

pretty decent game i have only play the game for 12 hour and i could say that it be something worth to check out easpically since it be free to play sometimes it get over reptitive to get more power rank you need to complete dungeon or castle and open up the chest after you kill the boss s this be mainly what the game consist off so sometimes it may become boring otherwise the game be perfect i have play with friend and i have get to tell you that it be much more fun with friend it be fun to grind the game it be like a kid version of neverwinter the cornorstones spawn in great place and your cornorstone save by itself you can fight random mob while free roaming and once in a while a miniture boss spawn near you so with my overall expierence i would definitely rate this game a 8 5 10,pos
so far so good play world of warship from the same company and this be just as good definatly playable without spend on micro transaction although very enticing to pay to go straight to a high tier i would give a 7 5 10 due to the fact the mobile version of the game be the saem and you add to your credit tally by play that too,pos

i do not know about hearthstone as i never play it but i can not help but notice it be comparison with magic the gathering which i play for many year let me start off by say i think this game be really good if you have play mtg than you will notice it be very similar yet with a slightly streamlined style which work very well for a start you do not have to tap card and instead of declare attacker and choose defender this game have implement a sytem where you directly choose who you want your creature to attack this make the game play very smoothly and it be much quick too the drawback this game have in comparison however be that it do lack the same level of depth as mtg as there be less phase to the game such as you can not case instant spell or react to enemy move however what this game do so well be implement a few other mechanic which retain a level of depth which keep the game challenging and engage one of these be the prophesy rune system which allow you to draw a particular card in reaction to be attack at certain stage of the game this system actually allow for a bit of reaction play such as tap down an attacker if they be make a critical attack in the last moment another great thing about the prophesy system be that it allow the lose player to draw extra card which force the later stage of the game to remain challenging for both player another interesting system be the lane mechanic which mean you have to plan ahead which side of the board you want to play card this work very well and add yet more depth to the game as a mtg player i have find it very easy to translate my skill directly across to elder scroll legend the colour mostly play the same roll with a few aspect mix around there be also a lot of the same creature skill but with different name such as breakthrough trample lethal deathtouch drain lifelink charge haste etc although there be no fly esl although have it be own guard system which work well with the way it let you choose attacker give the defend player a sufficient way of protect themselves i have play through the story mode which be really fun and the reward be satisfy and allow for great fully customise deck the soulstone system be great allow you to gain extra card of choice to further improve your deck strategy the arena mode be also great allow you to use ticket which can be buy with real money or earn in game coin and enter as sort tournament fighting against other real player where you draft a deck on the spot from card choice the card art be wonderful and although there be some aspect of pay to win i have find no problem with play my deck against other player and not get overpower,pos

you want a review well even if you do not i be give you one anyways tf2 be not like most fps game let alone one that be free to play tf2 be the sequel to a game know as team fortress classic a mod use the unreal tournament engine blah blah blah historical stuff i prolly get wrong anyways tf2 be quite simply an amazing game with 9 different class each with their own unique role in a successful match 1 scout he run fast cap intel cap control point and push the bomb cart with the power of 2 people warn since he run so fast and have a double jump allow for high evasiveness he s also pretty squishy have a measly 125 base health 2 soldier soldier be a powerhouse hold 200 base health and a rocket launcher that deal splash damage to multiple enemy his rocket jump ability though this take a lot of practice to fully master can get him to the point even faster than a scout 3 pyro the most controversial class have 175 base health medium pace walking speed and a short ranged base primary the flamethrower pyro can be see as the weak class while most newbie would complain to him be an overpowered fire demon here to eat your baby they really just do not know how easy it be to counter her one second though pyro can airblast projectile and extinguish burn teammate by use m2 or mouse 2 4 demoman arguably the most powerful class in the game demoman be here to bring diversity to the game yknow because he s scottish anyways demoman while have the same 175 health as pyro have one distinct advantage the stickybomb launcher this bad boy do 60 damage per sticky meaning that spamme it on a public game make you a bad player that should go back to play minecraft and the hundredth jumpscare game pewdiepie just play 5 heavy also consider one of the weak in the game especially without a medic latch onto him 24 7 heavy be the mascot for tf2 this bald bear wrestle russian giant show none of his ruthlessness in the game but rather the comic_strip which even then he realy kind of do not heavy have 300 health wow you must think until you learn his disadvantage he be the slow and have the large hitbox in the game make him easy to pick off from afar 6 medic oh boy medic be the second fast class in the game just after scout he also have 150 base health your cod wash mind may think hey where s his souper smg ding well that s because tf2s medic be actually here for healing sure he have a syringe gun which be basically a flamethrower without afterburn but no sane medic would rush into a fight like that as he would die near instantly each class have their own way of deal 100 damage in one shot though this be mostly up to crits actual skill instead medic use his medigun a long black healing device that can patch up your teammate wound in second plus when you have full ubercharge you can either have increase heal full invincibility 100 chance of everything your teammate do be a critical hit or a tiny uber that increase your resistance to a certain type of attack and give you health for the damage the person you be heal recieve 7 engineer engineer build sentry dispencer and teleporter sentry will guard an area sit in place wait for some unsuspecting scout to run in and get blast away by ton of bullet and rocket when your sentry reach max level dispencer health and provide ammo for you and your teammate teleporter be capable of send your teammate from one side of the map to the other however all these building require a lot of care as they be susceptable to many attack and will do no damage to stock uber the kind that grant full invincibility and since you will probably be take care of your building and aimbot engineer only have 125 health 8 sniper sniper if play right can outdamage demoman even though sniper only have 125 health he have the long range out of every class what with a sniper rifle and all sniper be the one of the only class that can kill a fully overheale heavy in less than 3 second the sniper rifle be not like most sniper rifle in other game have good aim be essential to play sniper as his main source of damage be get headshot otherwise he will normally do only 50 damage 9 spy spy be a real sneaky rat he can diguise as any class sap building turn them off and eventually destroy them unless the engineer hit and break the sapper his main deal be that he can backstab enemy backstabbe someone be always an instant kill with only for a few exception tf2 be a great game and i suggest you look into it,pos
early access reviewa very nice twist on the genre be enjoy the surprising amount of content despite it be in alpha also be not very good at shooter game i feel like the spell and sword give people like me a chance by allow more way of win than by play like as if it be just an open map mmo shooter i win my first game by play a mage i get all my kill by fly in blow them up with a fireball and hammer them down with a sword this game be literally the only game in which you can do that in the genre at the moment and i hope they expand on the fantasy aspect of it even further have play smite i have a decent amount of expectation for hi rez in expand on this concept further,pos
i find it disgusting that a game that cost so much to regularly play have abandon their supporter with the earning make go into yet another version of the hunter instead of continue the developement of the game we have all support get to make that money,pos
i do try and tire of fallout shelter back in 2015 when it come out for android as a fallout fanboy i of course click again when i see the steam debut two year ago i get bored of the micromanagement right quick and call it a day this time around i find the game now have quest and quest i have be do for almost the entirety of my 19 hour the game be design to make you buy power up but as thing such as vac ban be hardly an issue here i cheat engine myself 99999 nuka cola quantums and skip any and all countdown some of them would have be a real pain 11 day just to craft 1 theme to get 1 8 of an achievement for example do manage to get all but 3 achievement 100 objective 50 raider attack and 20 legendary dweller be too much of a grind even for someone as pedantic as myself human lifespan do have a limit to them thisll hopefully be the only fallout game i will ever give a negative review to although shelter do get you hooked very well from the start quest be mildy funny and it feel good to score phat loot without hack you would not even have that so unless you be a vampire and do not mind wait for 14 hour for your dweller to get back there be well fallout there be well micromanagement game,neg
i love this and do not even really know why haha it be kinda like when everybody have firbie or when everybody have those digital pet thing back in the 90 i guess the combination of micromanage resource as well as inventory management quest and dweller training management keep it fun enough for me to want to check back in a few time a day for like 30 40 minute to do random crap i play this in beta through bethesdas launcher alot more than i have through steam but back then it be miss alot of the cooler feature it have now like the branch quest and stuff i think that be a great addition and several of the dialogue option i have when stumble accross a random quest in the wasteland be actually well than dialogue option in fo4 at least that be what i think but hey i be just some randomdood who do not know crap about that kinda stuff this game be awesome up until your base get rekt by deathclaw and all your dweller be dead and you do not have enough cap to revive them at that point i think its pretty normal to ragequit and promise yourself you will never play this stupidaddictive game again as long as you still have breath only to return the next day and do it all over again do not ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever pay for the lunchboxe the wonder of pc gaming make it so lunch box be still accessible without pay a dime if that be how you want to play some people may find it more interesting to get everything the hard way and there be absolutely nothing wrong with that just have fun and do not spend your hard earn cash on micro transaction that be completely superfluous,pos
early access reviewrip robocraftseem like every time you log in now there be an entirly different economyedit check it out recently it be somehow bad without change anything from the last time,neg
early access reviewfirst off if your on of the people who only give a game one chance that last not even an hour expect a hook to pull urself in then i urge you to wait put the game on your wish list and wait a while atleast till out of early access which should be soon october 13 now if your the kind of person who be willing to take your time with something and experince the growth of a new game then i can truely recommend this game artix entertainment take heavy influence from previous game they make but reach out and pull similar idea from mmo for good or bad the game do not push to be the ultimate flashy experince but offer a true crossplatform system that work wonderfully so you can game with your friend that may not have as beefy of a pc also it be nice just to be able to open up the game for a quick run of a dungeon while on the go as well as a mobile game this be top notch finally i must add how excited i be for the class system so many game lock you into a certain play style and class but aq3d open the door for you to freely move between class though be warn only 3 class avialable not include guardian hence my first point so yeah i recommend this game to people who enjoy loot system and mmos,pos
a diablo clone that have do a good job of keep all the good thing and avoid all the bad thing you will still be excited to find rare item but give a lot of flexibility to change them the skill tree be large but likely only portion of the grid work for certain character there be some room to take back skill point and add them elsewhere gem and socket be a nice touch on how they can be combine and work together the game revolve partly around craft but its not clunky like many game make it,pos
early access reviewonly a little advice for the developer please guy insert a menu with option in the lobby and with the exit button now i always have to close it from the o s menu and i can not close the game correctly the game be really funny and i be always really into every time i play the sound part be really very good and also the graphic i really really like it and i will also speak very positively about this game on my youtube channel in a very short time i still have to try to play coop with friend and the chat system but i think it will be ok or at least i hope so the only think i do not like it the missing of the menu in the lobby please put it as soon as you can this game will rule in a very short time i believe it,pos
early access reviewif you do not mind get kill and not able to get a kill because of the stupid lag of all player and possible hacker in this game then i highly do not reccomend this game there be more lag in this game than all online game that have lag put together trust me when i say i do not like or play game that have lag i do play game that have lag but nothing compare to the amount of lag in this game steam would do us gamer a favor by take this trash off the steam market of game,neg
early access reviewi do not understand why not many people play this game it be a very strong game that have already enough content to hold on it be 10e pricetag physics be really great the engine choice be great graphic be great it run smooth and it have ble bling effect and after all it be a medium scale space battle game who do not love space battle edit i forgot to the add the fact that for some reason this game have like 140 player online usually which as i say be odd around all the time but the dev still develop it at a good rate,pos
i renember play this as 12 year oldkid and now i be 19 and still akid to the pepole i play with great that i pick this game up again and the amount of joy i get from it,pos
i do not know why i enjoy clicker so much but this be by far my favorite one you have to use a bit of strategy for this one your character placement be super important as each character have its own unique buff add dps damage per second to all character in the collum behind you etc new player keep in mind the enchantment point from the mission carry over across reset as do gear experience point do not i love all the nerd reference as well if you like monty python you will adore jim the lumberjack he be okay escort the holy hand grenade of antioch be also not bad if you have a terrible internet connection you probably should not bother with this one if you be not connect to the net you can not start it up and if you aquire a chest while you be offline the game crash,pos

early access reviewonly one way to describe this game for an 5v5 interstellar basecapturing game wow you be the captin of a huge ship and try to destroy the other team base with amazing weapon ability and all that on a skill base only then there be a jumpdrive that you use to jump into a battle i love this kind of stuff teamwork be key to stratically win there be so many type of fleet you can pilot and the gameplay look and perform fantastic,pos

early access reviewi be so impressed by how well the team bring everything from our old adventure quest world to life the game be not even ready yet and it be already amazing all i can do be appreciate and thank the team for the hard and impressive work this game will be big already be 3,pos
as a diablo series and generally blizzard funboy i can tell that these guy do a pretty good job on the game concidere the game be actually free unlike diablo for exp as far as i know there be not anything you can get with real money so there go the pay to win aspect a big variety of skill ability and a massive talent tree give you alot of choise on how to actually play your char the only thing that could be a little bit confusing to new player would be the way that the minimap be work it look like it be bug unless it be actually bug on me p generally the game be actually fun to play and its worth your time 9 10,pos
early access reviewthis be a great game and be worth pick up especially since it be free the developer care about the game and be constantly add new content to the game free of charge he game be and mmorpg and be about explore new area and land and complete quest along the way get gold finishing dungeon and do quest be all super fun and satisfy a massive part of what make this game good be that it be not singleplayer instead it be multiplayer so if you go to a place for example you can find other people do stuff in that area quest get gold etc this make the game extra rewarding as you feel accomplished when you can show your new weapon to the people in the hub town of battleon or in the forest of darkovia,pos
this game be absolutely fantastic be play since close beta and the dev have actively be balance the game with frequent patch new card every month an absolutely fantastic story expansion with wonderful voice act and difficult challenge and all on top of very deep gameplay that in my opinion yes be superior to hearthstone have play hs for 2 year and esl since close beta many month ago this be the game i can recommend more highly than any other in my steam library,pos
what would make this amazing be vr support still well do for people that complain that they have to pay for access to most of the content nothing be free the dev have to eat and there would be no content at all if they be not make money somehow whether it be this model or buy the game outright which be an option,pos
i do not really know how to feel about this game it be like hearthstone but with elder scroll card i think if it have more content more in depth card building ability i could see it be good i wish they would have go the mtg route instead of what the do if they would have take their time and want to make this game good they damn sure could have i think it would have truly be special but they do not it be almost like they be try to ride the wave of game like hearthstone i feel like each game take little to no thought process i get bored of this just like i get bored of heartstone sad,neg
this game be not bad as i think the only thing i want to complain with it the zen i want to try different class and i need zen to unlock character lot i can not buy zen neither on their website nor in game cash shop it keep say can not buy zen at this time well when can i buy zen then if you really want to make money you should not stop us from pay you money come on i beg you here be my money give me some zen,neg
early access reviewi recommend try but not invest very much time or money in this flawed product good game but the shuffling algorithm be absolute trash you will get game where you do not draw any mana at all for multiple turn no matter how many you have in the deck the response from most people be that s variance and its good for the game the problem be this happen way too often as in frustratingly often it happen so often i have contemplate uninstalle the game multiple time however i have the sink cost fallacy in full effect i have spend money and time so i do not want to see a waste in my investment i suffer on but quit my session shortly after start due to these failure almost every time frustrated in such waste potential from an otherwise fun game i would recommend people try this game but with the deck variance be so extreme compile with a clearly terrible shuffling algorithm you will get a very large amount of non game game with no mana for you or the opponent equal an automatic loss for that party,neg
love play on mobile and would prefer play on pc but i can not recommend it until there be an option to minimize the window change the resolution in it be current state i can not access the option on the bottom of the screen mean i can not create copy any deck will be a thumb up if this be ever address,neg
tl dr hard game good game free game play it if you ever want to know what its like to be a background character in a war movie and live just as long as one hereatms your ticket the good open world with very large map mean you get to choose when where and how you fight combined arm combat roll in with a tank carpet bomb with a gunship or just charge in wave your gun around massive scale as chaotic as it be awe inspiring high octane fast pace combat your starter weapon be very viable and will not need replace any time soon even after 6 year the community be strong and the dev be very active teamwork be reward and easily accessible but solo play be just as viable kill be satisfy as hellthe bad there be countless way to die and you will sample them all like fine wine your enemy will be grizzled vet with hundred if not thousand of hour play the learning curve have a well define face dent from player smash into it the grind be notable but not unreasonable for a free to play game performance can be rough but with an upgrade to directx 11 inbound this should improve fairly quickly the ugly nc max,pos
early access reviewstarte with the good stuff the game give you a lot of option from what shape your vehicle to tactic and platoone its get a large variety of building block that you of course use to build your robot a decent amount of map and a big tech tree there be also not soo much stuff to buy so its not a pay to win game good stuff there be a couple thing that bother me tho the chat channel mechanic be very rough the people you get to chat with when you be not in a battle be random please fix it guy i would apreciate d there be also not much of a drag friction and gravity mechanic tho so all the surface be glass like kinda annoying if you ask me cuz you slide down slope like its nobodys bussiness unfortunately tho in this game there be two design type that be really op due to the fact that the game do not really have good phisic and the comunity be divide some say that it have turn into a really messy moba because of the new gamemode other be not happy about block nerfe and more and yes personally i do quit the game because it get repetitive and the thing be that when you get in or any tier tier 10 just barely your next like 20 battle be go to be bad ur just gunna die and die and die just because you do not have the equipment that the other guy have i definantely think that instead of 10 tier there should be like 20 now you be happy when you be finish a tier and when you get into the next one its like omg wtf can i do to not constantly diie for f sakes and that s the point where i quit the game in tier 10 but i have still spend 100 hour play and it be fun even with the weapon nerf and these thing so do try it out i still think it have potential,pos

ok heres the real story yes you need a membership to hunt all animal but you can try the game for free and hunt muledeer with a rifle they give you for free if you like the game then fine you can order a 3 6 or yearly membership and its fairely cheep the big the memberhsip you order the more free stuff you get i order a 6 month membership and get everything i think i would need to play forever in gun anyways if you have to collect everythign ingame yes it get expensive but why do it a shotgun can hunt anything anything in game because it have 3 kind of ammo there be fancy gun with ingrave for people who need those but never for free doh and several type of bow and arrow and sight scope etc and on and on but you do not need all that for less than the cost of lottery ticket you can play all year long and hunt every animal you ever want in great detailed forest and on cold snowly mountain no its not all free but try it out be so try it or leave it no problem but its a good game just not what many people hope for,pos
this game be very unbalanced for new player you get put up against people who either pay for their tower or powerup or have be play long enough to have tower better suit for each map while you be stick with random tower or pea shooter i will continue play it incase it have potential at later time but it be a negative for me,neg
early access reviewthis game be extremely beautiful if you be able to run it smoothly with my experience even at the low setting i still experience stutter that last up to 10 second this be extremely annoying during battle or while even just walk if travel you would freeze for a while then teleport 500 foot i be sure the gameplay would be awesome and engage if i do not have to worry about this major issue for now i do not reccomend until the game be more stable,neg
dcs world be one of the few game i can really enjoy at any time of the day its community eg hoggit tend to be quite welcoming and friendly to all type of player and that be huge plus dcs of course have a variety of aircraft mostly purchase one for around 40 i would recommend pick up a 10c asap graphically the game be quite nice in the air but ground texture be lack in certain aspect but edge should in theory fix this along with some performance problem on old rig overall 10 10 gud gume 60 fps no crash,pos
early access reviewwow this game be pretty t imo the control be pretty hard and we need more screen resolution we be not in 90 era i know this game still in beta test i hope you guy can put more screen resolution and fix the control to make it easy for now the game be unplayable i will put my update my review once they make new update,neg

path of exile be one of the good game i have ever play poe be a free to play game but unlilke most other f2p game out there there be absolutely no way to gain any bonus or anything by pay money the only thing you get by pay money be cool skin for your gear it do not have have any effect on the actual gameplay the game be quite complicated but that be what keep me come back for more as there be a near infinite amount of combination of skill and character build most of them with significantly different playstyle while the campaign do get a little old after a while on one character you have to repeat the campaign 3 time on different difficulty grind gear game have say that they have more content in the work that will eliminate this with a new act schedule for release in early 2015 overall i would rate poe 10 10 a must play,pos
early access reviewthis game be what hearthstone magic the gathering would be if they have a baby the tutorial be a bit long but totally worth it because you get 9 free precreated deck you can win easily in this game than you can in hearthstone or magic tg it may be early access but be still fun any how i have not notice ang bug in this game yet some people review that you have to log in every time you play that be not the case with me i only have to create a user name and password once and verify my email be mine hearthstone i stop play because it rely on rng to win this game take skill and patience to create a deck that work for you another problem people have with this game be 1 3 of your card have to be power card call sigil in this game they say it be not good for them because they draw sigil when they want a playable card in this game you have unit spell attachment sigel i get to say this this game be addict i do not mind invest my money in the game when i can afford it you get 10 card in a pack of card with at least 1 of them be a rare or well card in this game there be common uncommon rare promo and legenday card gold be easy to make in this game than hearthstone and sometimes you get multiple reward for complete them like gold individual card and even card pack also dust which you use to create card you donr own in yhis game you can view cards by rarity card type or any combination you want you can have 4 of the same card or special sigil which usely give you sigil from your deck or 2 different sigil for the price of 1 in your deck unless their specific sigil which take up 1 3 of your deck there be 2 currency in this game gold diamond gold you earn by coplete quest or win a match diamond i think you have to buy with real money but i be okay with that because i be invest money in a game that i think be well than hearthstone or magic tg i think it aid in the development of the game i have not find a limit to the number of deck you can have yet i have over 30 some i make some i buy and each sigil type have a level up system which i have not find out what leveling up do card in the game stay the same no matter what level you be but you gain reward achievement for reach certain level there be a lot to this game that keep it interesting and addict some of which you can do for free you can have as many casual or ranked match you want you do not stop get reward when you reach a certain limit either i hope this review encourage other to play it too i hope other enjoy it as much as i do i can recommend this game to newbie or veteran,pos
you do not even have to play on survival mode for this godforsaken crap to undo everything you have build up i start a second game after get a well understanding of the mechanic get an absurdly powerful plasma rifle as my first reward use training room to amp up the stat of my resident and how be i do in a single random group of burrow mole rat make me burn through all of my stimpack and kill over half of all my character level range from about 5 to 20 for an average of 15 or so we be talk about the 2nd weak enemy in the series besides radroaches here i swear on my honor and sanity during that same sequence that make me rage quit i have 1 vault dweller arm with an enhanced sniper rifle that i believe have armor piercing capability i uninstalle the game the second i quit so i can not confirm vs the last molerat in the vault fire about 3 to 4 volly of shot and the the rat still kill him this would seem to suggest that standard enemy can get strong if you do not meet some arbitrary gameplay milestone not that you would know give that the help section say nothing to that effect there be no level indicator for enemy and you also can not get a numerical value for their health or depend on the circumstance even a health bar i assume this because to get feral goul attack in my previous run but i decide to wait on make baby to power level stat this time the final record for how long i last in the game before get royally screw be 3 goddamn day to clarify after the basic have be introduce and your vault population expand new training room that increase stat be unlock this be because the only thing that leveling do be increase your character health but say health increase be supposedly great if the endurance stat be increase but just like everything else in this damn game there be absolutely no way to know what the hell impact it be have let me just go over the thing the game will never let you know the aforementioned extent to which endurance impact health increase the numerical value of the character health the default likelihood of anything happen when use the radio to broadcast in the wasteland or have a deathclaw randomly show up at your vault door what stat if any govern melee weapon effectiveness how close far a character be from build up to a critical attack and with regard to room almost everything want to know to what extent merge room help before spend money too bad want to know precisely to what extent increase training room speed help before spend thousand of cap to upgrade it too bad want to know if the help section aka bethesda be bse you regard training speed go faster with more people in the room well i sure as hell do not notice any difference want to know whether you have the craft resource recipie necessary to make something in the later craft menu before spend thousand of cap upgrade a weapon crafting room too bad even the radroache can be completely absurd get like one stick in an individual room with the aforementioned plasma rifle and it will be dead before the animation or sound of an attack can be hear but have them spawn in a large room far from anyone and 5 to 6 can turn into 10 to 20 for no reason and one of the room be literally incapable of housing resident despite be a location enemy can spawn in and just to put the cherry on the garbage gameplay sundae your little vault minion could only be more incompetent if they shoot themselves if an enemy walk into another room your poor helpless flamethrower brandish uber guard suffer from crippling depression that prevent him her from pursue due to their profound sense of failure to stop them earlier and must be drag by you every single damn time but do not think that it end there melee enemy on the other end of the room can still hit your sniper rifle weilde vault dweller on the opposite side and they most certainly will be on the opposite side because bethesda naturally understand that if there be one thing that a time sensitive resource drain cluster f of a combat sequence need it be for every single goddamn character to waltz over to completely arbitrary location within a room before actually open fire or put out a literal fire and on top of that human combatant will often stumble and stagger for what feel like an eon after loose all their health drag out the time that resource can not be produce for even longer thus put you in the position of sit there unable to do anything but wait as a bunch of drama queen raider drunkenly stumble about harmlessly with your vault dweller be equally passive even as the siren blare and the resource bar flash like it be actively be depleate i know bethesda be hopelessly inept in most respect but i do not think they would find a way to screw up we be give you this for free think that be the end of the bs nope if you look through the help section it turn out that the radio that can be use to attract people to your vault as well as pretty much any instance in which the vault door open have the capacity to bring deathclaw charge into the vault deathclaw and if my experience with the molerat and roach be any indication i could only expect every character to drop dead the second they enter the room never take any damage and somehow fill my computer with malware take money out of my account for microtransaction and give me cancer it be never happen to me but again i only ever get as far as feral goul so it be probably a late game thing with the gameplay be a mindless grindfest the only other possible asset be story which as one would naturally expect from a free game be nigh non existant in term of be a source of sincere motiveation you be a vault and there be people in it the end oh there be quest that you can send vault dweller out on assume that you can spare any of them your valuable equipment and you build an overseer room even after all that you be reward with stare at a travel progress time for hour on end because it can take up to 30 hour likely more since the travel time seem to increase as the quest progress and i think i recall one have a 36 hour time to start with to get to from a location for one mission so good luck try to stay invest in quest that have you sit around do nothing for hour wait for one or two line of dialogue to give you any more story before make you do it all over again and on a personal note the game be an affront to biology and really in favor of the adam and eve story because there be more incest than a southern probably should stop now before i violate steam guideline regard user post before i finish that but the point be there be no amount of in family screw that can not occur in the game the weird thing be that the game actually kind of encourage it with the mechanic no i be serious character name can repeat so it be difficult to keep track of who be relate to who and it take hour for radio call to bring people to your vault if they bring people to your vault that be one of the reason i have only like 30 to 40 character for so long i be try not get parent and sibling to get down with one another but with the way this game present them you would think human be mouse or something anyway that be just a niggling aspect that bother me the more substantive issue be the gameplay i you need a fallout fix then play new vegas again if you have not play new vegas before then my question be what in the hell be you do look at bethesda to make a good fallout game go play new vegas instead i would recommend wastland 2 but i have not play it yet though it be in the same vein as fallout so i guess it would be worth a look,neg

do not read the negative review please read this first this be a very good hunting game as a real life hunter i enjoy the level of realism this game provide it be not realistic in many way but it be not a hunting sim even though i wish it be that be say it be certainly the most realistic hunting game on the market it have a wide variety of environment weapon specie and equipment it have incredible graphic good ai awesome online multiplayer real time competition interesting mission decent skill system with acheivement a photo gallery of your kill and decent statistic track the gameplay be fun while remain somewhat realistic but it do have a learning curve once you understand how the game work you will have a blast the negative review almost all come from people who do not read what they be download they think this be a completely free game without do any research into it thehunter do have a subscription base system and microtransaction but it be not all bad they just update their f2p model and it be more than fair now keep read as i write this review currently there be 10 map 29 huntable specie and one specie of dog you can bring hunting with you when you download the game for free as a guest you be able to access all map however you can only hunt 5 specie for free whitetail deer pheasant and three rabbit species the free specie be on all but one map all other specie require a license that you can either earn by do mission for in game currency gm or buy with real money em you can even earn em by do sponsor deal which i have not do so i can not tell you whether or not i recommend it you can not shoot animal you do not have a license for you be give two weapon 12ga single shot shotgun and 243 bolt action rifle with unlimited ammo and a few other item for free to start your hunting this shotgun be legal for every specie in the game as long as you be use the correct shell birdshot buckshot or slug the rifle be legal for mid sized animal include the whitetail check the wiki for more information between the mission for the 5 free specie you can earn plenty of gm to purchase a host of equipment to improve your chance of be successful and even buy license for additional specie that be all without spend any real money this route should be consider more of a demo to the full game as it teach you about the basic of what the game have to offer once you be convinced that the full version be worth the money you can purchase a membership bundle or subscription subscriber unlock all animal map and unlimited free ammunition for the duration of their subscription bundle be the good value if you be just get into the game however bundle include a subscription and a host of weapon and equipment i would highly recommend the trailrunner bundle 49 99 which include a year subscription and a host of weapon and equipment when your year subsription be end you can renew your subscription for another full year for only 34 99 there be ton of extra weapon and equipment you can buy a la carte with em real money i have spend an absolutely ridiculous amount of money on this game and i do not regret it i love hunt and this be the good hunting game out there you do not have to spend a ton of money to enjoy it though you can have fun for free or take it up to a great time for 49 99 the subscription be fair and necessary because the dev be constantly update the game and add new map specie and other feature even if you do not want to spend money on the game you can download what be a great free whitetail deer hunting game before you go trash a great game do some research on what you be actually get into it be not fair at all to the dev or long time player who want this game to be support for year to come there be a wiki and forum for learn and get involved in thehunters great community happy hunt all thehunter wiki www thehunterwiki com thehunter forums forum thehunter com trailrunner bundle,pos
a good game but it take a long time to wait may as well afk cause it take hour to do something but overall it be a fun game not really pay to win but require a lot of time dedication and strategy on how you would plan to build maintain and survive from your vault and on how you would defend your vault from incident such as the op mobs which sometimes make you feel annoyed when they appear in a sudden like deathclaws radscorpions and molerats,pos

i have be play this game on another platform in case anyone be wonder why i only have so few hour play this be just my opinion on the game the dev and the situation base on my perspective as a player after month of unsatisfaction and hope that thing would get well i have to warn people that this game be pretty much a scam the game have not receive a proper update in over a year important bug and ui issue still have not be fix problem that make the game tedious frustrating and boring have not be address no new feature be add to make thing interesting meanwhile the dev do two thing 1 they promise content fix update etc 2 every month they release 3 package at 15 a piece that be way overpriced for what they do even 5 would be expensive imo people have be buy these time limited pack because they think improvement be come soon instead the dev just make empty promise they make poll on the forum to pretend that they want feedback they publish list of stuff they be supposedly work on they make excuse every week for unexplained delay they blame most of the situation on the community manager and replace her by someone who just apologize more for delay in other word they do everything they could to save their reputation despite not actually do anyting good for the game a few week ago they also start to lock critical topic on the forum and they delete old topic where they promise more content it be kind of funny i think this would happen so i keep screenshot of these thing i guess i have enough experience with dishonest developer and their money grab tactic to see these thing come the bad they do be that they even ban one of their loud critic and top player from the whole game for racism for jokingly refer to the chinese company owner as our chinese overlord as if it be not bad enough from what i have be able to understand that comment be make in a private discord channel the forum mysteriously become much less critical after that everyone obviously start to worry about their game account get ban for make up reason long time contributor to the community who have special status on the forum acknowledge their effort also mysteriously lose that status after criticize the game and become less vocal about their complaint well recently the dev anounce that they have not be work on any of the thing they promise instead they have spend all their time make the game available in china they say the promise fixes improvement and additional content would come later and they release 3 more pack at 15 a piece anyway the thing be i do not think any fixes improvement or content be come they pretty much lie for month about work on this when it be now clear they be not so i think they do not plan to work on it at all they be probably just try to sell as many pack as possible until the game stop make enough money so my advice do not spend any money on this game it be overprice the dev be lie about work on content they censor criticism and they try to hide the old promise they make the content you can buy be overprice it will take you a very long time to use it due to broken game mechanic and it be very unlikely that thing will ever get well it be one thing when dev make plan for new content but then unexepected stuff happen and they can not finish the work it happen but in the case of shop hero it seem they never have any serious plan to begin with despite say otherwise and that be not acceptable at all you have be warn,neg

a bit of simple fun a good time waster if you like collect stuff expand your vault and go on occasional quest it be free but i feel it worth get the one time starter pack since i would play for a number of hour and be enjoy it a few tip when you can send people out to the wasteland leave them out for a while it seem to take time before you start get item make sure you have nuka cola quantum if possible to avoid long wait for get to quest area and come back from them that say once your vault have enough people in it to keep go while people be away quest it can be good to send people off to pick up weapon schematic and other gear try to send people who be high level then what the quest need and ideally send a party of 3 with as much stim pack and rad away as possible click the max button for each as due to a bug the item will not be available in the quest if you add the item one by one rad away be sometimes useful but you will usually need one or more stim pack,pos

you really need to prepare yourself to play this game you need to be ready for people to belittle you for make small mistake and expect everyone to have little no regard for a good team composition expect everyone else to actively seek to assist the enemy team in any way possible that way when you encounter decent people you be pleasantly surprised people get tilt super fast and it can be terrible when idiot come in pack now that it be summer break it be go to be hard to play and stay positive with the young crowd have the witch hunt mob mentality with report people so if you want to enjoy your time play pay little attention to chat unless someone be actually attempt to offer constructive criticism do not take it personally when people talk trash unless its constructive please remember if you be not part of the solution to toxicity then you be part of the problem,pos

my vote for the great because i pay award this should win because you literally be not sh t if you have never buy stuff in the game everything be base around buy more to be well than other also if you want the first purchase reward do not buy it through steam you need to download the arc launcher and log in with your neverwinter account and buy your stuff through there me and many other make the mistake of buy through steam so yeah pretty pay to win in my opinion well that be just my guess anyway maybe if you have nolife this game for a few month you may have some decent stuff not likely though overall this game be a lot of fun in the early stage but when you become a reasonably high level you can not compete with people with some well item which you need to buy with money or trade a lot of stuff to get that much ad so prepare this game be fun but be prepared to grind a lot if you be a free to play who want to play with the big bois,pos

early access reviewthis game be basically magic the gathering give the hearthstone ui treatment and legendarie that break the game downside be that probably 80 of my game have those 1 in a million power draw rate like get 10 sigil in the top 15 card or get 2 sigil in the top 20 card thing that should happen occasionally but should not be happen with anywhere near the regularity that they do it be probably the number one thing that kill my enjoyment of the game the game free to play model be pretty generous but you will be absolutely destroy by certain legendary card that be so rare the only effective mean of obtain them be buy the large box that guarantee their drop rate be it worth it i do not know it be definitely get deep strategy than hearthstone but keep hearthstone problem of 1 card making or break a game if you lack immediate removal it be also much hard to narrow down a strategy like you can in magic thank to the high power and high card limit requirement,neg
this game be one of good free game that i play the community be nice and can be social what u know by experience for this game be that it be go to take you a long time to master every class personally i will go for candy barb he be a great starter class and the whole gem system can get u really strong very quickly if u grind and do a lot of dungeon for hour and also i recommend watch twitch live streams bc the twitch streamer give out free stuff like wing and rarelike that and the trade system be huge so if ur look for something u will have to find someone or either buy it the game be a huge adventure honestly,pos
i have play this on my android device and on windows version through bethesda launcher and this be just the good on pc why because it be lag free experience and you can play with wide screen recommend all the way,pos
this game be get a lot of bad review because people see it as pay to win i be here to fix that in the game realm of the mad god there be thousand of micro transaction you can do to get well gear that would take a legit player longer the only difference be when you get the item from actual boss in the game you learn the value of them and how to use them instead of start off with 20 of gear and die at level 15 at least they do not sell stat pot in the nexus for real money that way someone who pay 100 be still not well than a legit maxed character tl dr you can not pay and get a more rewarding experince,pos
early access reviewgreat look game with great idea but some dev who like censorship and tell their fanbase to off other review go into detail about this its also very very pay to win be able to spend money on get a sniper rifle then more money on ribbon to unlock upgrade to make it insta kill be super annoying semi same for a machine gun mg42 sgt44 in particular imo they should just make all gun 1 shoot besides mgs pistol and smgs remove health bar on tank and vehicle and replace them with damage model or section by section health ammoracks turrets hull track engine all with their own hp just seem well for the play style spawn kill be a problem in this game since i last play mid ish 2017 one map in particular where you spawn in as a tanker and within the amount of time it take for your guy to turn on the in game engine the enemy tank behind you can kill you stand out in my memory just over all the good do not out weigh the bad and the dev do not exactly help the good in any way but hey it be free it go ahead and try it,neg
run like straight dogon my 3 thousand dollar pc have to find tutorial to edit ini file just to get well performance but still run like dog i see almost no player to play with and no one respond in global chat i wait a couple year for this game so dissapointing i be hope it would be a good replacement to aion which i quit after 6 year nope guess ill keep wait for pantheon,neg
  warn long post incoming first of all in game description they say thousand of player in my opinion there be about 2500 player active in every 3 5 battle you start notice the same name in the list when i start play the game there be player counter show 13k 15k online player as soon as there be 8000 and low developer remove the counter i wonder why i have play the game over several year about 1400 hour in steam and even before it come to steam i have see many update many hotfixe and nerf i can say that this game be die developer be not listen the community developer do not really know what they be do good example create ton of skin over 1 5 year and yet not a single new assault map developer be ally bias usa su and take thing personally when someone be adresse question about german faction nazis and the big f kup be the 1 12 update the developer rush in unfinished unpolished unreal the last update be the reason for this review till this point i hope that game be get well but i be mistake only reason why this game be still alive be because its free developer fix your game and listen player who have at least 1000 hour of gameplay in their account,neg
early access reviewhit detecion be awful scope do not seem to work on most gun it still force you to use iron sight i get that this be suppose to be more of a parody but its not very fun at all,neg
easily get outshine by other game too grindy the grind be not rewarding quest be uninteresting and even annoying to complete the combat system and character customization be pretty rad do not know what else to say about this it be a waste of time even if you be rich,neg
early access reviewthis game be an absolute blast for those want a smash bros type fighter this be the way to go i hope to see a console release of this on psn and xbox live soon perfect for both platform,pos
early access reviewit play a lot like world of warship in space and i like the different role of the ship and if you have a team that communicate well it be a great experience some ship feel very niche and not worth play if your team just do whatever they want so team play be pretty essential it feel very moba esque but would be nice if they add some more map and maybe some sort of creep wave the good news be the developer seem to take player feedback into consideration tl dr space ship go zoooooom pew pew pew and boom boom boom,pos
early access reviewthis be actually a pretty good game although there be alot of hacker which make it less fun but recently i have notice alot of people turn against hacker and leave them in empty lobby but its very fun pretty easy the poor mans csgo would definitely recommend just beware of hacker,pos
early access reviewstupid op card now its become who get the legendary first be a great game ruin by power creep sorry to say i have play from the beginning and be very impressed by the game play early mana screw problem be address but the constant new release have turn it into a power shower first to get the big card out win on the plus side reward be very generous so you can build a collection easily and make valid deck just do not get disappointed when your carefully build board get wipe by the kill all enemy fly monster please bring in the no legendary league to get some balanced play again,neg
early access reviewwhy be i play this game that be my initial review around room 80 now be at room 132 i realize this game be a lot more intense fun and scary than i previously give it credit for my eye be wide and my heart be start to beat a little fast thank to this game,pos
early access reviewit be all good and fun the first week before they make it impossible to solo on a ranger which i be have so much fun on try to refund the game i think the day after steam stop accept them do not know at the time get deny so now it be just sit there as 75 free to neowiz i have try to log in a few time since but i never last more than 5 minute at this point 32 day leave on my premium status but only use about 7 day of it so sad to know that they get to keep the money for unused account that be unable to refund,neg
early access reviewthe game use to be sort of fair now it be just stupid you use to go infantry vs like light tank now it be infantry vs heavy tank with no way of penetrate their armour as all your rocket just get impact angle too high or armour too thick where do the fairness go that this game use to kind of have reto i do not say you should buy this game but i still play it so many give it a try at your own risk p,neg
very addictive casual game be play it for a while on my phone have no idea it be even on steam until a friend advise me that it be easy on here then on the app either way i really enjoy it though the quest can get a little frustrating but that be likely more down to my poor planning then anything it be get a lot of resource management quality and it can be difficult to get enough cap to improve your shelter without go on quest or explore the wasteland but the game be certainly worth a playthrough it play like a sim game sort of where you need to manage the dweller and their resource think of the quest and wasteland exploration as job they need to to make money you can get directly involve in the quest as well but not the exploration which could be consider a bit bleh but it be still a pretty decent game and it be free,pos
product receive for freeearly access reviewit free but you have to have buy extra thing in order to even use the good sutff that you unlock make this a pay to winit be good till you runout then thay dismantel your robot and only let you use upto uncommon part where all the good stuff be rare and above so no do not play this game,neg
i be just look for a space base strategy game because i would be watch too much star trek lately but fractured space hit the mark just right it have strategy deep enough to be engage and interesting but not so in depth that it become overly complicated and tedius it have beautiful visual and intuitive control with a wide array of ship to choose from i would reccommend this game to anyone into space battle,pos
i like it like i like most thing with a side of salt this game need some balance update but you can say that about the real tcg do to some unbalanced deck it can make some duel in gold rank and up vary unfair,pos

amazing sound amazing physics up there with ac it do get expensive but this be more of a hobbiest title and not so much a casual mess about perhaps like irace unlike ac however it be playable with a gamepad but really really recommend get a wheel for it a thrustmaster t150 will only set you back a 100 quid and will be well worth it always get update which be interesting for a 6 year old game in 2012 it be early access and be a bit weird to play it feel like race07 with a graphic overhaul however its come a huge way since then and be freak brilliant sometimes i just hop in a touring car and casually mosey around nordsclief just nail through the gear come off the throttle sit back and listen to all the mechanical part of my car whine chirp away while the exhaust spit flame and make all kind of wonderful noise this sim be worth if just for the sound alone very immersive,pos
brilliant game so good that you can fly a dragon only after ourchase 999 gem which will only cost you about 29 99 so not only be it cheap its kid friendly put yourself in this position your kid want to play school of dragon you load it up and let him play it 10 minute later it have crash oh no but luckily it be a in game time which be purposely build the flying be so slow as so kid do not get too hyper do i mention the fact that word like die be block in the chat want a friendly place for your kid,pos
bless online i like the game and want more people to play it but at the same time i acknowledge the fact that it run excruciatingly bad even on a monstrously powerful rig you can hit spot that bring your frame down to single digit overall i like the universe they have here and i be excited to try the game for a couple of year now since it be announce that be say i understand why player be leave so often i feel like the game could easily be save with more attention from the dev more focus on what the community need fix i do not think bless will find its place i want it to but i have a feeling bless be bind for the graveyard sooner than most fail mmo game if you want to try it now be your good chance because i doubt it will be around long i hope some day in the future they rerelease bless as a finished and fix product i think the good thing right now for the game would be for anyone interested to try the game and then voice constructive feedback to the dev make sure htey know what need change,pos

i may be a little biased here but trove be not a great experience for me now i be not say do not get it mostly because it be free for now but when i play it for an idle two hour i get bore fairly quickly sure the world be pretty and i like the 3d cube style along the like of minecraft but the gameplay be repetitive in my brief session i rocket up to the high level rank and it be not even that different i feel no motiviation to upgrade my house or tool or even try out other class also the building block be really uninspired all they have be color primal block and ore at least that be all i find naturally mining be tedious dying be easy and the combat be not polish hey maybe it update and get well since i play and hey maybe some people like this tedious adventure but as for me i do not think i will pick it up again 4 5 10 would not dig again,neg
early access reviewgood game for a casual timepass like counter strike go but free not that great graphic and server lag sometimes also the korean chineese aesthetic in design be not my thing but still fun to play and fast pace action one downside be that most map be too small and cramped and spawn point be too limited,pos
this review will be base on the current time i have with the game 545 0 hour total this game be a lot of fun way back when it just come out of beta and before all of the major update which in turn ruin the game in my opinion i truly love this game from play with friend to just farm by myself this game be a blast although this game be very repetitive the outcome to what you be grind for eventually pay off and you feel a sense of satisfaction but that feeling go away as soon as you see that you have to farm and spend hour upon hour to get anywhere in the game most of the hour that i have log be back before the update of the game where they introduce gem and they start to make item untradable meaning you can not trade them with player and you have to get item yourself rather than trade for them which be a core part of this game since the start of trove i still log into this game from time to time to see if anything be different and to see if i can do anything in a timely manner i do not suggest this game because of the time that it take for the player to get anywhere in the game and the extent that you have to grind for the item that you want,neg
start play this game without realize that it be a cellphone facebook game it be very slow pace with it take hour for your dweller to accomplish certain thing the pace would not be a problem by itself but once you get past a certain level enemy get exponentially more difficult make it impossible to continue to advance without microtransaction and or some actual strategy consider that this game pace at good relegate it to the play during commercial break category the idea of spend more than a couple dollar or put more than couple hour of effort into it be absurd,neg
i have spend a atmatmatmatmatmatmatmatm of time play this game and all i have to say be i have never be so horribly disappoint by any game i have ever play in my entire atmatmatmatme life like most mobas it start out great the game be fun and fairly well balanced and the community be actually significantly well than the notoriously toxic community of other mobas such as league of legend but just like every other game of it be type it go to absolute atmatmatmatme horsecockery first and foremost the company isatmatmatmatmatmatm they do not listen to the community they get countless complaint all over about different thing that be not work as intend or not work at all severely overpower god and game break bug but instead of fix or even acknowledge those problem they tweak a few minor detail once every thousand year that make little to no difference and be typically thing that no one want or give aatmatmatmatmatmatmabout the god be so horribly unbalanced and the less skill it take to play your character the high your chance of win this if atmatmatmatme fact loki poseidon and odin be prime example out of the vast supply of exist god currently in the game i would say there be maybe 20 that people actually play there be far too many instance of god that be just plain better than other and i do not mean counter i mean that there be about 5 mage that be 4000x strong than all of the other mage and this go for every single class not to mention every time they release a god they overpower the livingatmatmatmatmatmatmout of it in hope to get more people to spend money on them i really do love this game when i first start play it and would easily say that at it be peak it be the good moba i ever play but just like other mobas i have watch it slowly decay into the bubblingatmatmatmatmatmatmvolcano that stand before me today i could spend so much longer talk about everything that myself and many other find wrong with this game at this point in time but i realize that i have already waste too much so if you wanna know more reason why you should not download this taco bell shotgun diahhrea game feel free to contact me and i can give you more reason than you could ever possibly need if i have to thoroughly sum this game up in a sentence i would call it nothing but a gargantuan atmatmatmatme time vampire 0 100000000 would not reccomend to the dark lord himself,neg
i start play eternal almost three year ago and have play consistently since then i have not play modo since i pick it up and i try arena but find it lack in critical way i have try out hearthstone gwent and artifact but none of them have really take my interest i love that i can pick up and play 1 5 game a day or if i want to play some event i can play for hour the game economy be friendly and sensible deck be interesting i can play draft seal or construct the ai mode be fun for day when i just want to mess around with basically zero thinking or if i be on a bad connection or know i will be interrupt the dev team be responsive to community request and keep a close eye on comment reddit discord twitch in game feedback and the constant pile of stat they gather on all aspect of the game i have not feel the game get stale which be amazing for the length of time i have be play it be easy to play for free i recommend pick it up to try it out for a bit check in on reddit and discord to get some pointer the community focus be one of the good part of the game there be also some very approachable twitch streamer you can get a good feel for thing by watch any of the more popular one for a few minute twitch chat be amazingly non toxic you can ask question and get useful answer to just about anything,pos

early access reviewi can no longer say i enjoy this game the developer update it much too fast and take too many of the feature we like from the game add new one that make it unenjoyable unless they decide to revert it back to an early version or at least remove some of these godawful new feature i can not recommend this game,neg

i be try to write a review somewhat base on my experience for play almost 3 yrs grind with the germans americans british and the japanese but not the russians because i do not have the time and interest whether be tank or aircraft each faction have its own up and down however every battle i jump into the russian will win often whether be alone or joint with other faction maybe it could be map design or people complain about broken mm match make fm flight model and many thing in the game if you read the forum in the communitiy for the most important part be that i refuse to believe russian bias you can win by communicate to team best play with a friend through skype or teamspeak it take skill and observation in the battlefield and know the weakspot of your enemy but now due to recent update and horrible fix of the game it become somewhat unbalanced mostly match make and the graphical glitch where you see your enemy behind a wall or bush when you be not aim your gun sight sometimes the hit detection do not inform you whether you make a confirm hit of the target or not not to mention the amour physics can be a bit whackky here be the list i like and dislike about this game like good graphicstatical gameplay realistic battlesnice cockpit visualsarcade battle for casual funnot pay to wineventscan make your own custom battlessingleplayer missionsgreat immersionfun game for ww2 and cold war enthusiastsimulator battlesdislike and some joke match makingmap designbroken flight modelst 34 spamt 54 spam t10 m spamrussia stronk that german aa tank with 4 20 mm camo on tanksthe annoying british 4 wheel of aa hellcrusader aaramminggetting teamkilled spawn killingmore spawn killingkv 2is 2any russian tank that have a gun caliber size up 100 mm to 152mmcaervon m18 hellcat or a jackson flank you from behindrussian text in chat meh,neg

while i enjoy this game and i will recommend it i feel there be a sharp disparity between the player who do not spend a dime on this game and those who tend to be far less frugal micro transaction run rampant and by no mean be i go to pay money for an item that will probably be lose due to the perma death look at the description hundred of item to discover i think discover mean find throughout the course of gameplay and not pay for how disapointing all say however i will still recommend the game it be fun enough to play and it be a way to quickly and efficiently waste time,pos
to be honest it s my favorite mobile game i spend 0 and 0 and i still have a competitiv deck to play with it eat time like nunu minion but otherwise i like it big reccomandation on my side kek ohne kek,pos
early access reviewi have be play since the close beta and this game have be a blast currently there be four different game mode available rank be where you play against other player with a preconstructe deck on a ladder the matchmaking generally work pretty well the only issue i have run into be with some long wait time which a large pool of player should alleviate draft be like rank except you begin by draft 48 card from 4 pack and build your deck from that pool this be a fun game type that also help build your collection since you get to keep any card you draft there be also two ai mode gauntlet let you put a preconstructe deck up against the ai to earn reward and help you build a draft style deck by give you three card to choose from at a time to go in your deck this be another good way to build your collection as far as gameplay go i have really enjoy it my background be in magic the gathering and this game sit in a similar place in term of strategy you can interact with your opponent on their turn and combat give the defender their choice of blocking and how at the same time the complexity be not extreme and the turn structure flow pretty smoothly once you get the hang of it i be hope that dwd will put out a comprehensive rule at some point since there be a few interaction that be not immediately obvious and seem to be inconsistent but those be rare one of the good thing about this game be the community it have some name you may recognize if you be involve in the tcg ccg community be luis scott vargas brian kibler and patrick chapin they be not always on but it be not unusual to run into them in a draft or rank match there be also finkel but he be not the real finkel even though he be great you can see the touch of these player in the meta which feel fairly balanced it be a little aggro heavy right now but that be already shift as people start rebuild their collection they have also tweak the meta outside of a full set release by give out promo card that can be earn by win your first game of the day or craft if you do not feel like compete for it overall i would give this game a 9 10 it be a great game if you enjoy the genre and i strongly encourage you take a look,pos
sadly too much of a pay to win with little reason for non pay player too continue play it there be lot of f2p card game which do not feel p2w due to how to shop work or due to how matching function i do not understand why the consumer should choose this over other f2p card game which be simply more fun,neg
this game could be and would be decent if it be not for the change to the menu as other review have say it seem that they go in reverse with be intuitive but i do not have any preference because i do not play at launch progression be great in the beginning then it become a korean grind fest essentially unless you pay for membership of course the game play be super fun if you enjoy mass ship combat and maneuver large semi slow vessel strategically but it all come down to healing and range as long as you have superior heal you can not be kill as long as you have superior range you can kill before be kill the community for this game be go i have be through dozen of match and it be always the same you be up against a bunch of bot with semi believable name that end up sit still the entire match and you may have 1 player on your team who be real if you be unlucky and the only actual player you be destine to lose good game die way too quick easy progression then grind to a halt for that next piece give it a go at least until tier 3 ship,pos

product receive for freeokay after 570 hour in the game i recommend the out of this game if that do not get you to install war thunder then install war thunder you fool it be a free game so why not well one reason not to be because you will get so addicted to it you will litterally forget the name world of tank it completely overshadow wargaming in every way and now with the 1 77 patch i can safely say it be one of not the good game i have ever play okay i mention why you should get the game now time for the juicy inside scoop of what come after well my freind you have much more than a random number generator with health bar that it be competitor provide this game use a full indepth x ray modular system where every shot count shoot the driver and that tank can not go anywhere until he be replace but be carefull he can still shoot back way better than a health bar now take that idea and expand it to the whole tank then add in differant shell like high explosive that do not penetrate the tank but give the enemy crew a bad headache and bad if the crew be not hide behind armour high explosive anti tank that the germens use litterally oneshot everything and good at range but expensive so if the gameplay good graphic well it be not next gen but u do not need next gen in a competative environment u need framerate and trust me the option always allow you to have a great framerate with great graphic although it will not look that great like modern title if you do not have a monster pc your in the heat of battle and will not look at the small detail when ur panic that that guy over there just set you on fire well do i mention this game be tank plane aaand ship well now i do think of it as a mega wargaming u as a world of tank warplane and warship it complete the 3 battle princaple of air ground and sea and it come together perfectly as in applejack word think of a ww2 simulator game as a apple pie you can have amazing apple and a wonderfully crispy crust but only together can you have a perfect apple pie so it be get ww2 ship plane and tank that all nope there be pre war tank that you start with and cold war behemoth this game span be large time period and when you think you have get a amazing tank it get well but be warn this game be not balance no not in the slight despite gaijin good attempt at the moment certain machine stand out at their rank but just like real life some may say well i agree a little there be a way arround these player with a unfair advantage outsmart them but you can not most of the time so that annoy me too i can not play with freind on this game for long period of time because they get so angry and just ragequit,pos

be you look for an extremely rushed game with early 2000 style graphic that be basically another one of the thousand arma rust style copy if so you have come to the right place this game will no more disappoint you than it will underwhelm you in this gloriously low poly third first person shooter you can wander aimlessly into a decently make terrain with very little thought put into it explore or do not expansive forest with about 20 tree complete with a glorious 2d look be amazed at the rushed feel of the game as it try to leech itself into your wallet be at awe of the fact that there be more to buy than there be to do in this game if you be think about toss your dollar into a fire or spend money on dlc for a game think no more this game expertly let you do both in an environment you will not want to play in for more than 30 minute marvel in this game right now as it will not last long spend your money on dlc and buy the dev more programming tutorial and pizza now,neg
i like this game a lot because i have be big fan of game like world of tank and league of legends but i also really like eve online for awhile i always love space game and this game give the combat eve do not really have which be be able to control where your bullet go i know for many this concept do not really apply to them but this mean alot to me i do admit that the game have its problem such as game crash when minimize the game or the waiting for game can be funky for example sometimes my friend and i have to restart our client to get a match or the match would be abort i also love the battlestar galatica reference and the concept of control entire ship which supposedly hold thousand of crew be really cool the game graphic be excellent which i love and expect from space game however do take into account that the game have just be release not to long ago and that the player base be still grow plus its free to play and the game have no play to win they follow similar stragety to league of legend with people be able to buy skin for money therefore give the game a try and if you do not like it then uninstall it simple as that,pos
  counter strike robo offensiveno one like these damn crate it be a cheap pay to win method of suck the fun out of people who be reluctant to fling their wallet at freejam backwards evolution somehow this game seem to remove more and more balance over time to the point of just throw every player they can find into match overpower weapon no one ask forit feel like freejam procrastinate so long they forget they have to make an update so they just decide to throw in a new poorly balanced weapon into the game at the last minute as a sorry excuse of progress removal of mega botsi see no real reason why this be even do it be as if they remove them without know why they want to or what they be go to do from there craftingthis be not an update freejam literally just replace the word in the code this could have be do by anyone who have even take coding class in high school again a lazy excuse for an update while they roll around cluelessly try to figure out why the popularity of robocraft be drop faster than stock price on black thursday removal of armored blocksagain no clue what they be go for here it be fair and balance pretty much a major factor in what make robocraft unique it seem like a good third of my grinding in robocraft be to get well armored block and there they go wipe day of effort it be just too complicated for it be own goodand not in a good way you can jam all kind of new content into your game faster than ever before but that will not make it any better if you do not slow down and put time and effort into it sh t plus sh t just equal big sh t removal on limitation of gun typeslette every bot have whatever kind of weapon they want at any time remove most if not all diversity in robot all creativity and design in my opinion that be most of the thing the community do not like about this game it be very simple to find out what they do not like as several people have do the very same thing i just do statement from freejamfreejam have recently announce that they would be partially fix some of these issue such as the crate and tier they have even state they want to remove all way to buy part with real money this be the first positive thing they want to add to robocraft in a long time if robocraft hold true on their plan i will be more than happy to change my reccomendation for this game,neg

early access reviewthe game mechanic be good and the concept of build your own deck custom tailor to your own play style be promise unforunately once you enter the ranked modus and play a few match the first thing you realize be that most of the people just use 9 5 deck that they look up on eternalwarcry the second thing you notice be that player with legendary card simply crush you in every possible way you already tickle the oppponents health down to around 5 point next turn he draw one of his legendary card and two round after that you be finish no matter what you do i know legendary card should be really powerful but if you encounter in ranked modus tier 3 bronze player with several legendary card in their deck it simply feel frustrating bottom line have no fun at customize your deck for lack of card and the option of simply copy other people deck stillwant to build your deck on your own have no fun at get annihilate by legendary card,neg

early access reviewi love the series and the fact that they seem to always make sure that its possible to solo pretty much the entire game that be a huge concept your the hero the person that villan despise and the point of the game be to get op and stomp the badguy in the dust however the game seem to always exploit when your not pay attention or make a mistake and you can still loose as often as you win even the basic enemys can snag a kill on you if your not to careful overall i feel like the game be a great representation of the 2d version i just hope that all teh fun class werepyre be my favorite still carry over i do not think the game need to change i just think the addition of 3d open world sort of feel be all it really need why mess with a game that s already a blast also keep in mind while there be glitch bug thing that do not seem right its a game mean to poke fun at all the stuipd thing video game do that s half the fun of it all,pos
one of the good f2p and fps game out there not pay to win grind to win but that s ok you will not see cheap move like buyable class or race truely massive battle huge map 100 vs 100 and vs 100 be a common thing the good gfx and atmosphere you can find for a f2p game 3x faction pvp system ingame platoon management so much fun when in an outfit guild especially if your leader be able to read the map and develop strategy start as a lame soldier and grind your way to become a leader scout medic anti tank pilot mech support infiltrator carrier what ever you really wish for each individual be need on the field world event for the win able to test eqipment before buy active player and community it be not about mindless killing and zerg rush team play and right strategy be the key word new content almost every month or two the developer really like to develop soe team do good job very very poorly optimize even after all those year of development this be the bad part of the game lag be real sometimes random kid be everywhere with friendly fire solo gameplay be not rewarding and boring after a while you will have to play hundred of hour to be able to unlock those special equipment you want compete with high lvl player be frusturating when you first start the game there be a learning curve for every class gun and vehicle in the game can be confusing without proper equipment it take a while to be actually usefull in the battlefield some weapon be poorly balanced and very expensive thankfully you can test them before buy air combat mechanic be not satisfy despite be so fun it be just so hard other than world event there be no actual quest in the game ghost capping be your good bet at this point no story or plot what so ever not that it need to but still you will have to maintain your connection for 2 hour to benefit post world event reward or else you will just lose 2 hour with one little disconnect so much time consume and so little rewarding sometimes you will not believe your eye so many different enemy player skin can actually trick you as friendly and some player be headless somehow microphone problem which they should have fix by now all in all fun a serious game for gamer with serious ambition yes i recommend this to any one interested,pos

early access reviewi have play this game way too much my 5 hour on record be only because it be not on steam prior to open beta it be a card game that take a lot of what be great about mtg throw in a ton of original concept that can only be do in a digital card game and wrap in up in a much more user friendly package than anything like it on the market the free to play model be pretty friendly and the game be very fun,pos
this be a highly realistic racing game that easily beat most other in fun and misfortune amazing for record videoe and competative gameplay why purchase a wannabe game when this beast show you the great experience for free charge you for extra note there be a practice mode for those who do not want to race right away you can get use to the gameplay,pos
early access reviewhag play a lot like red orchestra ii except if the graphic be about 3 year old and it have severe server and hitreg issue and be free to play but approach pay to win and have terrible balance and let us say you just start you be give a semi automatic rifle and a pile of grenade seem not bad the problem come when you realize that that rifle be only semi automatic in a game with such atrocious server struggle to hit and also take far too many shot to kill you can of course buy an smg early on as the game helpfully direct you to at that point you be the god of cqc at least until you be flank by another fine gentleman with an smg but then when you reach level 3 you be throw into the big boy server there you get to play with enemy plane tank paratrooper and sniper and of course the enemy side always have more of whichever be the most problematic for you in my case that turn out to be mainly tank with a side of pesky sniper the tank be hard to fight as a foot soldier there be little you can do to start off there be the occasional panzerfaust single shot in a box which can be pick up on some map they be nonexistant on other they be in location vulnerable to enemy fire later on there be a reloadable rocket launcher to unlock but i can not force myself to play long enough to get enough money for it most map have a lot of open ground which mean tank can spam from hundred of meter away and sniper can pick you off from similar distance the game do not have a ping counter on the scoreboard but i be sure i be get at least 100 maybe 200 ms ping at all time the deal be also sweeten by the fact that everything that matter be serverside there have be many many instance where you shoot a guy and even see the blood spatter but the server do not count it as a hit i can not reccomend that you play it at this point maybe it will get well it be a beta but after see how far it be come in the past two year of beta not far i do not hold out much hope,neg

a pure grind if you do not spend money you will be underpowered unless you speand at least a year on the game the game be make to frustrate you untill you give in and pay money into it hope for a well game it may be a free game but the way it be make be frustrating if you want a cool bolt action sniper guess what unless you pay money you will be use iron sight and fire off three shot into other to kill for a long time you may get lucky and get headshot but with no zoom and the game in 1080p it make this hard it will get to the point that you feel like assulte the peolpe who make this game sorry for any spelling mistake,neg
dcs world be definitely an amazing simulator it by far outclass other due to excellent flight model a multiplayer that make sense easy to learn mission editor and a large amount of detail even flame cliff 3 aircraft have more detail than something like war thunder actually dcs excel at detail for instance the a 10c it be the epitome of pc base simulator with most if not all of the real plane functionality and flight characteristic another example be the ka 50 and really any of the rotorcraft they basically be the good in their class with the full range of aerodynamic effect you would get from the real thing retreat blade stall translational lift ohmy blade just up and leave me hopefully not irl etc another thing be nevada test and training range it be a huge map most of nevada in fact even some part of california the entire las vegas city and suburb be present and amazing even though it be not out for steam yet as of update i will leave this here,pos
i keep say i do not like game like this i keep say how card game be not my thing and yet certain one will come around and disprove me they will lull me in and a few hour later i be hoooke and this be one of those game i have play 2 hour of elder scroll legend so far so my review be not a review of the entrire game as such but more an impression of the game after give it what i feel be ample time to get a idea of what the game be about the battle themself be a mix of really easy and really bloody hard and so tactic play a big part of card selection attack defend and buff your card to inflict damage but also to keep the enemy away from you i struggle with this take 5 attempt to do the early wolf battle but as sh arp as i feel the learning curve be it make me want to beat it to stick the middle finger up at it and say there i beat you mfer and i suppose ultimately that be what you want a game that be not too easy or two hard but require you to think a little more tactically each time you face an opponent i do see that there be dlc for a free game it be not really an issue as there be plenty to keep you occupied and to be unlock if you be willing to put the time and effort into play it although i can understand if some want to save time or simply have to have everything at their disposal to play with overall a great game and would recommend people at least try it once,pos
a few month ago i would recommend you this game with fly color but not now why the hacker problem be completely insane and out of control about half of all of your match in pvp will be a hacker most people be aware of the disconnect hack where your opponent will make you disconnect from a match when they even have to slightest risk of lose therefore make you lose the match and they win but there be many player also use a modde apk that can let you see your opponent face down card and the one in your hand this be evident when they make really specific obvious play to counter card they should not be able to see even konamis own kc cup tournament be fill to the brim with them and in classic a konami stupid move they disable the ability to report and block people in the kc cup it be like they want to encourage hacking in their own tournament listen konamiadde a report function be not enoughgive the game some sort of anti cheatand let us report people in the kc cup i mean i do not know what the you be think do something like that,neg
this game be awesome because of trading i prefer trade rather than play but playing be interesting too its so good to just go and trade and make profit but there be a minus that the key price be tf2 be too high i think valve need to create new key or something i do not know how to fix the price of key i recomend valve to try to play tf2 trading itself and see problem with it but i would recomend this game because its like trading game and fps game put in one game last thing i almost forget that they should make paint drop for f2p more often because its the only tradable drop for f2p so yea,pos

  i have play all the fallout game from the main series to the spin off and i have to say this game be rather enjoyable i start play it on my phone but decide to play on the pc because it make my phone die in a few hour i like it because i can spend 15 minute to an hour playing make progress without much effort basically great for casual play i personally have not have any issue on pc but from what i read other have something about lose all progress and save game be delete from my experience both phone and pc i have never lose my save but one time on my phone i have progress lose for some unknown reason during an update it happen i never purchase anything from the store and the proof be in the last achievement i will never get apparently you have to purchase or obtain a ridiculous amount of lunchboxe to get all legendary dweller lol good luck with that i have have over 50 lunchboxe obtain by quest and objective and only have 4 legendary dweller just 16 more to go i guess that mean i need to get 200 more lunchboxe the rng on the pet drop suck too i have about 10 useless pet and 12 useful one get good pet be like find gold bar all parrot anything with damage resist damage wasteland goody healing crafting time and training time be what you want unfortunately rad heal twin chance happiness or poodle persians dalmatians and german pointer can go away because they suck for long term vault as of right now after 100 hour of playing i have 2 persians and 4 poodle and it suck that the rng on my carrier be waste on them recently i figure out that if you open a lunchbox before you open a carrier your chance of get a different pet increase instead of get useless duplicate all the time some of the quest be comical every now and again i do a ah ha at the cheesy joke also some of the quest test your understanding of fallout lore from other game mostly from the main series of 3 do not expect to see stuff from 1 and 2 aside from all the negative stuff i say i like this game if you be look for casual play you will probably enjoy it too,pos
very high knowledge cap require for mastery of the game you do not need to actively trade but it be highly advantagious and encourage no auction house but there be sell thread on the main site and spin off site that work decently well the dev be very active in the game and produce a new expansion that consist generally of new game mechanic meta difficulty that require you to learn how to rise above it this happen on average every 4 month the game be not overly grindy to level to where the majority of people be at if you know what you be do but be extremely grindy to get to max level the good part of that be it be not need to be that high of a level by any stretch of the imagination there be lag that will hit you frequently more or less depend on your char playstyle and that be a fault of the client to server communication but you can help to make it less frustrating by make a macro that type oos out of sync extremely fun to make new build character and actually encourage this behaviour the game be very challenging however it reward you for overcome it be difficulty the only negative i can really list be the lack of an auction house system the lag that sometimes happen and it be very recommend to purchase bank space if you want to be an active succesfull merchant but the price on all the micro transaction be very reasonable and be not game alter ala pay to win lot of cosmetic micro transaction that be really cool if you like that kind of thing,pos

early access reviewwhile not have play the game as much as most other there be a reason for that i refuse to play a game that continue to drop framerate down to 20 30 for no reason at all more on that later on this will therefor be a rather short review the pro visual be opinion base but when the game run like it should it be a blast and look good the combat be entertaining in an mmo where you will do this most of the time this be important option in character creation be plentiful and it be a good system the dungeon i do be fun and well design the con optimization the game drop fps for no reason it do not use even attempt to use the cpu gpu disk or memory before drop the fps far to low this if anything have to be their priority they have to find way to deal with this but sadly nothing have change since the early access launch add new content should be do only when it run well and not before in the current state of the game i can not recommend it if however they find a solution to the drop in fps that a lot of people seem to have then sure i would recommend people to give it a try but due to the engine it run on i find that unlikely to happen,neg

bless online be an example of mmo developer capitalize on the large pool of mmo tourist and people desperate for their next fix the game offer nothing original except for it be horribly do combat system the game launch horrible and the dev have do little to fix the core problem with the game mainly the complete lack of endgame content it be clear that while neowiz may care about the ip they lack the talent and competence to fix it and give player what they need to survive scummy practice and missing feature that be not publically announce only to hide behind the guise of early access if you want an mmorpg to play that will not turn you away with anti consumer method check out eso wildstar or guild war 2,neg

tl dr it be hearthstone but with all personality remove tes legend fall into the same trap so many other ccgs have it be not a game anyone actually want to make so they just take some mechanic from exist game slap some differnt picture on the card and call it a day mechanically it be perfectly functional the interface be clean and work nicely while game flow pretty quickly and will usually take no more than 5 10 minute the single player campaign serve as a tutorial that introcude the mechanic for those who have not play similar game but if you have seem almost any ccg before you will quickly get bored as you be force to play an hour or so of easy game just to unlock the rest of the game as for the mechanic themselves it really be almost all just a copy and paste of hearthstone you gain mana each turn with no need for land or similar you play mainly creature which can choose to attack either each other or the hero you also get spell which be the usual damage debuff and so on and you have extremely minimal interaction during your opponent turn pretty much all creature ability be take directly from hearthstone charge deathrattle etc with the exception of trample take from mtg mtg itself have far more ability so it be clear which game be be copy here you even start with 30 health and have deck with a default of 30 card there be precisely two thing in the game that be not identical to hearthstone firstly the board be usually although not always in single player split into two lane with creature in a lane only able to attack other creature in that lane in single player sometimes the lane will offer different effect but in most game it be simply one normal and one that gies creature stealth for a turn in theory this be suppose to open up more tactical choice but in practice it really just bring the game more similar to mtg by open up a bit more freedom in attack and defence it at least make thing a little different from hearthstone but it still do not bring anything actually new to the table the second part which may actually be original be that each time you take 5 damage relative to your start health so healing will delay it you draw a card this make rush deck slightly less powerful and open a a bit more possibility for comeback a player who fall behind early can end up with a 5 card advantage which be quite a lot in game like this but it do not really change the game in any significant manner relate to this be the equivalent of hearthstone secret which give the sole interactivity during an opponent turn when draw a card due to damage if it have the prophecy ability you can play it immediately at no cost unlike hearthstone and mtg neither you nor your opponent have any idea if or when this will happen so while this can be quite powerful it be extremely unpredictable and impossible to plan around it be at least the one thing not rip directly from another game but it be really not an improvement there be no hero as in hearthstone but rather class that combine two card colour each colour focusse on certain thing such as big creature for red or spell for blue but other than restrict which card you can put in a deck that be the only effect class have if this sound similar to mtg that be because once again it be essentially identical other than restrict you more than mtg do in exactly the same way that many recent ccgs have do the influence of hearthstone can really be see with some of the colour such as yellow focussing on summon lot of small creature and then buff them to the point it could not have be any more obvious what they be copy if they would actually name the token silver hand recruit as for the game type and free to play model again see hearthstone you have single player tutorial practice mode adventure one available so far online rank match and arena pack and arena even cost exactly the same as in hearthstone and you can disenchant and craft card in exactly the same way as a new game it be not really possible to comment on how fair progression be there be nowhere near as many card available as old game so the ability to get a decent number of card early on do not mean much this question can only be answer over the next few month and year as it become clear if and how much money be need to have a decent chance of compete or at least have fun as a new player finally where the game really fall down be its utter lack of character the strength of the tes games have always be in the writing and the interaction of the player with the world the world itself be just a rather generic fantasy set with your standard elf and cat people and so on and since each game have be set in a different time and cover different event there be not really any establish character place famous weapon and so on this mean that unlike hearthstone where many card be recognisable and themed arpound their lore and legendarie be well known boss and important character card in tes l range from generic elf to the legendary slightly different generic elf the lack of animation plenty of particle effect but no actual movement just make it bad instead of drop ragnaros with a big thump and burst of fire you just place a card with a picture of an elf on it if you care about tes lore this game will not offer you anything recognisable or anything new if you do not already care about tes lore this game be certainly not go to get you interested in it it be a functional generic fantasy ccg with mechanic copy directly from other ccgs mainly hearthstone with a bit of mtg and a total lack of any character or anything of interest to recommend it over the many other similar game currently on offer it do not offer new and interesting gameplay it do not offer interesting character or gripping story it do not connect in any way to previous tes game it just exist for the sake of have a ccg with the tes name attach to it,neg

the art be amazing if subdued and subtle and the lore of the elder scroll be in full swing this game live and breathe the elder scroll even go so far as to get some but not all of the original voice actor from the game to reprise their role such as the arena announcer from oblivion this be also a very generous f2p game compare to hearthstone the amount of stuff they just give away in this game be astounding you get a free card for every three rank win and pve win reward you with craft material this game be quite simply one of the good on the market and i can not recommend it enough if you like hearthstone there s a good chance you will like this even more,pos
this be a really great game however there be a huge but the system promise that if there be low number of online player they will fill in the gap to make sure you get a game however the reality be that you will sometimes be wait over 30 minute to get a game very dissappointing,neg

early access reviewpersonally i love play this game with my friend however in the interest of progression i have a few suggestion for development of the game now i be not an expert or anything but just consider this the thought of a seasoned gamer first off i would like too see more work put in to customize all the character moveset make each one feel more unique secondly the overall movement feel a bit off not bad per se just off a brawler need to be a bit more fast paced than this one be the gravity could stand to be a bit more forceful and a slight increase in character speed could not hurt either and finally the map now i know this be still early access but a little more variation would be nice as a suggestion what about open map development to steam user and a rank system to make the better build map show up more frequently all in all this be a good start but need some more love before it will have the kind of replay value that smash bros do i like this game and hope the developer read this review,pos
rarely write review but this time i really feel compel to do so therefore forgive me if it will be a long one and probably bore short story you should really give this game a true chance without the pregiudice of any review good or bad i be so disappointed to see so many bad review from people that have play this game 2 hour at max and from people that still need to get to finish the story and or get a decent gear this game have potential it be not like every other game out there it give you a true free to play option the in game shop be just cosmetic and you can get the in game shop currency just by play the game dungeon grind and conversion of point in currency there be an anti cheat now that have kill all the cheater the one that be leave bad review i can bet on it you will have open pvp everywhere in contest area of the huge map there be a lot of content if you want to look for content instead of rush end game and complain that there be no content pvp and pve be balanced and the pvp be truly that as most game have arena duel and matchake bs this game have a lot of very well do content but as every game have thing that need to be improve it be your choice you can see only the bad thing or you can see the good one too and acknowledge that nothing be as you would wish it to be 100 the game have performance issue as every mmo game out there the graphic be in range with every other mmo as well now you will need to tweak your own ini file to get the good out of the game graphic it can be annoying i understand that but there be hunderd of guide out there that can help you do it in 5 min and you will need to go into your nvidia control panel and switch the game vram from integrate to dedicate this game mess up badly at launch this be very true but at the same time the dev team behind this game be not greedy as some would love to see you convinced about the dev team listen to the community and strive to improve this game every day keep in mind that the people play the game make the community if the cheater that buy this game want to leave a bad review out of spite i can not say anything more than to stop read at the review and give this game a true chance it be free now nevertheless i will keep buy my premium membership which do not give any p2w advantage to support the dev because this game deserve to be succesful more than bdo own tes o own and whatever mmorpg you can think about i have play them all p s even though most people get refund the purchase of the game they still complain you will have to decide for yourself who be in bad faith but for as far as i can tell it be not the dev team i be just tired of people donwvote game that deserve tho shine while upvote trash game,pos

a fun game to play if youa re interested in how gun work i do recommend this game to gun fanatic and people that be interested in gun but the con to this game be that you have to unlock gun with exp that you earn everytime you operate a gun in the beginning it seem real easy to earn that exp but later on it really take a lot of time to unlock the next gun if you be be not willing to pay real money then this game need a lot of dedication to move on otherwise this game be not for you,pos

wot blitz be a great game and be the only succesful tank war game out there on steam or ios platform the game have very good diversity like france soviet union uk germany usa and japan tank it include light tank tank destroyer medium and heavy throughout the game the game take awhile to beat and get progressively more difficult as you progress through the level something people would look for be gameplay with friend if you love tank but want to battle other people with tank wot be your game it offer platooning which be basically you team with your pal or family member to fight other people in this battle multiplayer this game also offer many iconic tank many people would recognize like the m4 sherman and it be variant the be 3 and it be variant and many other ineteresting prototype that most people do not know about i would very much agree to play this game also because it have little violence meaning if young people want to play this game parent i would let them another thing to consider be graphic and compatiability weak and old computer device can play this too and if you have a gaming pc it offer hd graphic and sound they also have training room fr you to explore train or do other stuff on the game just in case you get tired of battle i would definetley reccomend thuis game,pos
early access reviewthis be a fun game regardless of the amount of content it launch with or the issue that it have i be have fun with the class and as a fan of tab target mmos i feel right at home in bless with an add bonus of the combo chain system which be amazing and add depth to the combat the leveling and story have be fun and i have try multiple class as well as race from each faction on different server of course i feel like as long as they can deliver on their promise for the end game content that bless online be make for then it will be a game to play for a while for the moment i be enjoy the leveling experience in this game that i feel lack in other new mmo in the post world of warcraft era,pos
planetside 2 be a mass openworld multiplayer game where 3 faction battle it out over sector of many different continent use all manor of tank plane and a garage of other vehicle you can take to battle to try elude the enemy i quite enjoy this game but i do have a few thing to note the first of which be that you need a stable internet connection without it you will be miss every shot you take there be certain balancing feature of this game which could be improve multiple time i have empty whole clip onto a player only for them to turn around and one shoot me this be not a massive issue but be especially common for people with pay to win weapon this game be a little graphic intensive i try it on my office laptop at the low possible setting i could it be not the great experience and i still only average 15 30fps i then try at the max setting on a gaming desktop and even though i could easily get 100 there be a slight jutter to the way you play now i be not sure if this be a small problem with my peripheral or with the game but it be a small irritant apart from these little thing i would recommend this game to most people it be a ton of fun to get your friend together and siege a bio lab or even to go as a solo infiltrator good range of weapon and vehicle to have fun with and a generally nice feel while play,pos
fun game but the amount a dlc cost be pretty ridiculous and i be pretty sure a lot of people would back me up on this i mean the amount of money you would have to spend to get at least half of the dlc for this game would be equivilent to buy 5 60 game in some case though it be worth it but the fact they do not really have muchf freeware plane let alone a helicopter,neg
good game which can learn u a new kind of stuff i never know before how it work now i know if u be in the army police and want to learn how to craft ak 47 this game will explain u how to do it,pos
this game be very enjoyable its be able to entertain me for 72hrs so far and other more yet they go on about how microtransaction ruin the game you do not even need to buy anything you can earn all the thing that be be sell by just put some effort in the damned game and feel well about it too although you can buy thing to advance yourself without put much effort into the game which be of course fine but anyhow the game be very fun it be extremely lengthy you can play it for virtually forever lol go around start over kill farming get your character to maxe level which be 20 then go and get potion to upgrade your character be quite an experience you have to invest lot of time into the game and its worth it because in the end you feel like you accomplish something especially since some people just quit because it be too hard or frustrating to lose everything when i die when its fix to the point you lose everything when you die it make it more intruge you actually have some insentive to not just say all and run around like an idiot without a care and to actually play smartly and do thing correct the game be not for all but for the some who it be for you will enjoy it greatly just as i do,pos
early access reviewthe takeaway fractured space have qutie a lot of good potential the graphic be great thank to the ut4 engine the gameplay be something fairly new and fresh despite be base on exist moba archetype i feel that there be enough promise to put my 15 usd on the table after play just a few match it be like homeworld world of tank and lol dota hot have a giant party and everyone get together at the end of the night and this sexy minx be the result the good amazing graphic for a moba title fresh gameplay for the genre intuitive easy to master control unique ship design that feel plausible as real starship some folk do not care but for me that be a huge thing the bad horrible lag issue i be use to some lag but i have have a few match where i would jump large distance from where i be or where i intend to be without use any speed enhance abilite no tutorial and for a game as complex as this one can be at time there need to be a bit more information about exactly how match be suppose to work include as perhaps non intrusive in game tutorial message move next to the point to capture and so on something simple that you can breifly read on screen before it gently fade out i have manage to work out so far you shoot other ship and capture point on the map but exactly how to do so in order to achieve victory be not readily apparent even after read the in game how to play primer which barely have enough explanation to fit on an mtg card there be nothing the actually explain how ship or tech tree progression work either and if you do not know you could upgrate your ship system you will be less effective as you grind up to the next tier of ship however there be one big caveat i will give to my little bit of whine above i do not bother to read any of the how to play stuff outside of the control scheme for my first 3 match,pos
unbelievably unbalanced some card be game breaking and some deck be way too overpowered without any decent banlist to balance thing not to mention that it be clearly pay 2 win but it be a free to play mobile game so that be kinda expect,neg
let us get the elephant in the room deal with first do you need to p2p i would say no like any f2p game it will be fast if you pay cash to get a boost but it be not necessary i have see some guy really rocket forward but honestly just pay attention always sell your stuff for the max it can go for on the trade house and you will be fine the game scratch that i want to run an item shop itch and it do it better than most similar game i have play a few tip for new player 1 only spend gem on upgrade slot have a few upgraded crafting slot and quest slot be super nice i would say get 1 or 2 of each 2 fusion be super important it be not a big deal early on but by the time you be in the mid 20 you need it to move forward an upgrade fusion slot will also save you a ton of time and money 3 ah always sell for 10x what an item be worth if you see that item be not sell for that much then use fusion to get the item to the next high level anyway if i go any further in depth i would need to write a guide lol play the game it be ton of fun,pos
product receive for freeearly access reviewthe first thing that strike me about this game be that it be beautiful detailed capital ship glint from the light of alien sun back light from the blue glow of an earth like planet or the red fire of a lava world with undulating roll of magma ooze below it be stunning the game itself feel like naval capital ship brawl from the age of sail only in three dimension and with rail gun guide missile and the cold vacuum of space instead of the sea with fish in it rather than the more abstract control of most rt game this game put you directly in control of a capital ship use wasd plus extra key for vertical and the mouse for aim the ship feel suitably massive and take time to turn this add a tactical element use asteroid for cover as you try to blind side the enemy i really like the three dimensional aspect of this feel like i be battle khan hide in the nebula the ship feel impose and as their arsenal rain down fiery death from all angle it give a satisfying feeling of might there be an extensive range of ship to choose from each with their own playstyle they all capture the feeling of be in charge of a large capital ship rather than a zippy fighter there be however some variation in speed and agility you can expect large ship to be slow but heavy armored and more nimble craft to be weak there be no fighter craft to control some ship launch wave of fighter or bomber but you do not control these directly the specialised ability of the various ship stealth recon close combat etc in game require team base game play in order to succeed the focus be on multi player with the only single player play available be the tutorial personally i would like to see either a story mode or more bot base play in order to further explore the game before face down live player fractured space be a new take on a team base shooter the slow pace and large scale lend itself to a more strategic and thoughtful play style like home world but with direct control over your unit,pos
i will make my review short and sweet this game belong to my favorite genre fantasy iso arpg i have play nearly all of them over the year other may bring nostalgia and pleasant memory but path of exile be just a love letter from the developer to that specific genre personally i think it be the good game in the genre and it be constantly be update and improve the story be great as you discover the tragic history of wraeclast through encounter relic during your playthrough the storytelling be uniqe and it be mostly do through voiceover so there be very little interference in actual gameplay the skill tree be massive and may be intimidate at first so try go into your web browser to the skill tree calculater and mapping out a build and save it to your favorite then refer to it when you level up you gain skill through gem as well as way to improve those skill by link your gem together on your armor and weapon the control be responsive and intuitive and your skill ability make you feel powerful poe be free but not pay to win but you can buy some nice cosmetic item and loot box i get me some glowy eye,pos
its easy to explain 10 10 would play again,pos

call it free to play be pretty deershit since the free part be really limited try if you even like the game deal you can only hunt rabbit and one type of deer but for this game the 40 euro for a year of licence be not bad and you get load of stuff with it and if you buy something with money like new gun and such you can keep them indefinitely except the consumable and just buy the type of gun to suit your hunting style and your fine also the ammo replenish after hunt so you only need a case or two because the yearly subscription fee be not that big and you get load of stuff with it i think it be actually pretty fair just do not expect to do much without pay and yes if you like hunt and the game the developer fully deserve your money good hunting simulator since deer hunter series and i play that for hour and hour but it be definitely not for everyone but play this with friend or even sometimes with some random people online be ton of fun it really shine in multiplayer,pos

i first start play robocraft way back when the game be in alpha my old brother show me the game and i really enjoy when it roll over to stream i play the hell out of it but when they remove tier and add rank and the whole crate system i stop play the game because i hate the way they change it i miss the old robocraft i be leave this review because they be finally make the game good again bring back tier and remove crate bring back the old tech tree system i believe that with this update people may be able to play the good version of robocraft again so if your look into this game since its free just try to take a look at it its an amazing game have a fantastic day,pos

early access reviewi decide to come back to this game after a few month of not play and after a full night of play with a soviet soldier the last time i play i be an american soldier i notice that i have unlock essentially nothing i go from the initial rank to barely rank 2 in three hour of play and have unlock no upgrade remember that the leveling and unlock go faster when i first play i check my american soldier despite have play him for only 2 hour have many few kill and objective capture with him he be rank 4 with many more ribbon unlock have i mention that you need a great deal more experience with every subsequent rank the game be basically worthless to play without pay at this point i be entirely for support free to play game with microtransaction to get thing faster but not if they make it entirely worthless to play without pay the game be fun the bullet mechanic be fun the realism aspect be fun the idea be unique but they have butcher the game by cripple any xp gain,neg

the usual reason to play wot blitz be to speed up wait be it on the porcelain throne on a bus or in a queue now i can add just for the heck of it without use bluestacks to my list after 826 battle i have unlock chi nu japanese tier 5 medium tank at 2 british tier 5 tank destroyer su 85 soviet tier 5 tank destroyer kv 1s soviet tier 6 heavy tank leopard german tier 5 light tank i be initially very impressed by other bounce dozen of shot off the armor of the kv 1 and decide i must also have it the soviet heavy tree have be a boring grind for the most part though with the only exception of the t 46 tier 3 the kvs be very slow and virtually blind it be a lottery if you will manage to position yourself for a few hard hit shot and absorb a good amount of damage or you will getatmatmatmatmatmatmatmfrom behind by a leopard within the first 2 minute the kv 1 be incredibly weak until i get the good gun for it cost 20k experience but even now it reload so slow that a single miss can mean i be more of a burden than a boon to my team the british at 2 be the close you get to cheat in this game in a battle where you be the high tier and you manage to keep enemy off youratmatmatmatmatmand shooting at your front you will quickly ruin the other team game it have 203 mm of frontal armor which would be good at tier 7 you be tier 5 you be go to sacrifice speed it be really really slow and view range so you kind of still depend on your team to scout baddie out for you but this be probably the easy tank to steal the show with by shrug off thousand of point of damage and destroy most of the enemy team the soviet td line have be pretty much okay all around su 85 have a nice low profile for hide behind rock and hopefully make the enemy aim a bit too high and miss german light tank require skill a masterful leopard can punch much high than it be weight but it be also really easy to speed into a group of enemy and get kill within 30 second of the start of the battle it be an okay tree to unlock but nothing that exhilirate german tds be quite enjoyable especially the hetzer with it be small frame and very well angled armor plate for bounce off shot even if you do get spot surprisingly the japanese tech line have be by far the most fun for me i choose the light branch ha go ke ni ke ho win 62 61 and 50 of the battle respectively be productive in each battle the tier 5 chi nu be on the useless side start out but also quite good when fully upgrade what make the light japanese tank so fun be that i could reach any mountaintop their small size all stat be equal a small tank be better make almost any bush viable for total camoflague and gun with high maximum depression angle and fast reload time enable me to keep shoot almost every second of the battle shoot opponent be the fun part of wot blitz and the jap tank offer lot and lot of this i think it generally hold true that the high level you play at the more boring it get at tier 6 everyone pretty much a veteran know all the sweet spot on the map and punish any mistake you make harshly battle where you can kill 3 6 tank on the enemy team via snipe cleverly be pretty much behind you by then so i think it be fair to recommend play multiple low level tank instead of focus hard on one why i generally like wot blitz 1 good time killer app i know kill lot of it without get bore difficult or whatever effectively a time machine when wait at the dentist for example2 very short match queue i do not want to queue while i queue3 progress through tier of tank feel good4 at least for now no one cheat almost no one pay to win5 i get to learn tank names6 a lot less of a cl sterf ck than the original wot for desktop,pos
this review be for those who be already familiar with mobas and have play dota 2 or league of legend i will point out what make smite unique compare to those game third person camera perspective unlike the classic smite do not feature a strategic top down perspective and put you right in the action behind your character this allow for much more precise movement and sneak up to somebody do not necessarily require a cloaking ability almost every ability in the game have to be aim include melee and range basic attack that be right if you want to play the ad carry in smite prepare yourself to be completely useless if you can not land your basic attack same go for everything else if you can not hit your ability reliably you will not succeed there be precious few ability in the game that do not need to be aim from the other perspective this mechanic allow you to minimize your damage intake by be a slippery snake and wiggle your way out of tight situation many time i be one hit away from death but move in circle and triangle and wavy line and other sort of unpredictable movement i survive playable character hero champion in smite be real god from pantheon that be once and some still be worship norse roman mayan hindu chinese greek play as zeus thor odin loki and many other god and mythical creature hirez studios do a mostly great job at interpretate these well know deity into detailed playable character and for those deity you do not know there be always a lore section for every god so you even learn something about different culture while you play yay knowledge 5 different game mode one that change every day unlike its competitor smite feature many different game mode aside from the classical 5vs5 here call conquest arena 5vs5 no lane team deathmatch siege 4vs4 two lane small jungle joust 3vs3 1 lane small jungle assault 5vs5 all random all mid 1 lane the mode of the day change every day and feature fun setup like 5vs5 on the assault map and everyone get the same god all of these game mode have their own detailed and well craft map in conquest mount olympus oppose a vulcano in arena you fight in a grand colloseum in assault you defend the hall of asgard from the force of chaos in siege you fight for supremecy in the lush mayan rainforest and in joust you be a knight for some reason it will be change to a chinese themed map soon in addition to that smite feature one of the good deal in a free to play game the god pack the god pack cost 30 and contain every god currently in the game owner of the god pack also receive the new god as soon as they be release forever that mean the more god join the battle of smite the more value you get for your 30 you do the math why should you play smite over league or dota if you love mythology and you like the concept of mobas but never like the top down perspective and ferocious clicking of the traditional one smite will be the game for you it be highly skill base with a very high skill ceiling and many new challenge and skill to master that traditional mobas do not have i play league of legend for 4 year but after i get athritis this be a joke from play adc and kite for too long i give up for me smite be so much more comfortable to play and the fact that i can escape my death and make great play simply by evade and aim my ability carefully really drive me forward in a way traditional mobas never do i will not end this review without point out thing that bug me about smite i be not delusional many skin in smite be lock behind chest which you have to buy with real money currency and by open them you only have a certain chance to get the skin you want it can be infuriating when a cool new skin for your favourite god be announce only to later find out it be in a chest with 56 other item hirez abuse this a bit too much though we have the god pack so that balance it out eu server can be very unreliable quality control at hirez be either non existent or very bad some new god release in a pitiful state either balance or design wise they have horrid animation amateur like voice acting and be either drastically underpowere or overpower some god design be also very questionable sometimes they have ability kit that have nothing to do with their lore or in general be design in such a way that they make no sense do you know the spartans put the statue of ares the god of war in chain to restrain him yeah that be cool but only a small footnote in his lore well what hirez do be base his whole ingame design on that little fact he shoot chain and fire and run around in plate armor with broadsword and shield the shield have a demonic visage on it where the fire come out do that sound like the greek god of war to you not to me but these thing be minor and ultimately do not take away much from my experience i have be play this game for more than a year and only look forward it be free in the end so why not try it out and look for yourself,pos

give how a lot of free to play game be in recent day i do not have high hope for this i figure most of this game would be hide behind pay wall and player with more money in their wallet would typically wind up have a more fun experience i be prove wrong despite have many microtransaction option this game be rather fair with the premium currency it offer i have not spend a dollar on this game and i have still manage to buy many 10 pack of card my only real complaint be that because this be a port of a mobile game its go to suffer from some watering down of the mechanic specifcially the fact that deck be now limited to 30 card and the monster zone and spell trap zone be both limit to three card each in order to make the duel more fast pace so that user can get on with their life while i can see the benefit this have to casual player us long time player be force to suffer as our monster zone become fill up almost instantly and what be once great summoning chain can no longer be use all in all i give this game a solid 8 out of 10 not the good yu gi oh game out there but its definitely in my top 3 especially consider this game be still fairly young and its constantly recieve more content as time progress i can not wait to see where this game go in the future hopefully towards the 5ds era,pos

  its incredibly fun in a realistic wow this be hard but rewarding sort of way the plane be lot of fun to fly by themselves the mission be different and keep you on your toe you do not need crazy expensive controller to have a good time with this game i use keyboard and a 25 logitech extreme 3d pro fly with friend be awesome you can edit the single player campaign to make them coop always people to fly with in multiplayer and most seem to be willing to help noobs like myselfa little advice expect to get rekt the first few time you play the learning curve be steep but well worth it once you figure out how to play,pos
trove be an extremely fun game once upon a time but many recent update have push it towards pay 2 win gameplay it be a shame that trion could not expand the game while still make it accessible to free player,neg
  dead honest review so i think i have enough time in this game to thoroughly review this game let me start off with the prospros amazing graphic much well than the witcher 3 just in case you need a comparison story rich the quest be very well do and be never the same not even the side quest voice acting be amazing literally the good character design be spot on massive open world game fill with amazing quest character and other player dragon amazing character creation now on to the con con the graphic be sort of demand i can sometimes run it at like 30 fpsthis be seriously the good game i have ever play seriously blow game like the witcher 3 wild hunt completely out of the playing field download this game in all seriousness why be this on steam be not this a freaking mobile phone game or something,neg
early access reviewthis game be great its start out cute and funny and give you the cute jumpscares of cardboard cut out so you feel safe but then it get creepy and i be not spoil it but just download it with out watch video its great oh and its free get now,pos
update as of 25 november everything below still stand true and be still an excellent game i would like to spend a few moment on explain the business model of this free to play title tldr the business model of this free to play be solid you can aquire anything non cosmetic in the game by play it but by spend a few buck you can increase the rate at which you can aquire the thing you want first of i would like to say that you can access all non cosmetic item in the game without spend any real world currency by simply play the game as you be play the game you get xp from do pretty much anything relevant in the game and for every 250xp you aquire 1 certification point these cert be the primary currency in the game which you will spend on anything that interest you except cosmetic that can only be buy with real money however we be now go to look at the thing in the business model that be impefect compare to a completely fair free to play title while a lot of the upgrade and thing that impact your gameplay be only possible to aquire through cert certain thing can be alternatively buy by spend real money such as weapon weapon scope and possibly the soon to be implement implant also you can purchase experience booster use only real money that will for a limited time increase the amount of experience you gain while play the game lastly there be the ability to pay a monthly subscription to the game similar to conventional mmo title and this will cause you to recieve an experience boost as well among other thing that be say the start equipment be all competetive even in some case regard by many to be the good in slot for the experienced player as well,pos
early access reviewthe thing i dislike about early access title be that indie developer never fulfil their promise i know there be a lot of them that be still not complete to this day so hopefully this interesting horror game can final nail it spooky house of jump scare be very similar to one series that be part of the creepypasta universe scp foundation also know as secure contain protect this game have the similar premise of the scp foundation and its a decent one at good these specimen you encounter add nice tension throughout each same room that you enter over and over again even the game mention about it if you read the note that be to get you more invest to the game lore the game sadly do not learn a thing or two from bloodborne and alien isolation which those game refine the horror genre completely yes i be aware this come out at january before bloodborne get release i would have expect the game break free from the cliche that horror game have be stick with in the past i be look at you both slender and amnesia the gameplay be all about run away from the specimen and go to one room to the next you have a health bar and stamina system that it seem its try to play like dark soul a bit in first person the game have no boss battle at all so the challenge be to run away and dig yourself into the game lore you take damage if your too close to the specimen however you can get instant kill by one of them if your not very careful in one room you do get an axe very late in the game but combat feel sloppy at time maybe it will be better integrate at full release sadly the game be not complete right now there be still a few room to go in order to see more specimen and finally know the truth behind this curse house and the company behind it the optimization be bad there be no way to change the resolution or the game do not have setting to make the game perform better you can change the framerate but that about it hopefully the creator will make the game run a lot well than the state its currently in right now visually its not a bad looking game the specimen look nice they have quite disturbing power to mess with you and the sound effect be average at good not much to say about the score its ok for now maybe the final build will have a good credit theme when you reach the one room to get the answer we all want who know when this will be finish so i be recommend this because its free and well despite its disappointing shortcoming the game have potential to be something worth play from begin to end why not let your friend play it or better let some young child play it and he or she will know what its like get their gut spook hee hee hee,pos
one of the well f2p entry on the market for certain the dev take such an anti p2w stance that i be actually really amazed and tempt to spend money since the game not a black hole vortex for it like most f2p arpg have really be do to death and most really be not that different from one another but i feel path of exile really stand out due to a number of innovative approach to old problem level and screw yourself and worthless currency in particular i can genuinely say that i like character progression better than diablo ii it be still do not capture the holy crap moment of diablo ii loot or have the presenation of the gold standard either but it sure as hell do both of those well than the cancer that be diablo 3 only thing i hate be server lag the fanboy crew irrationally blame people internet but it be clearly the game server it only happen occasionally but when it do it be at a level high enough to be quite frustrating,pos
this be a nicely balanced game you can play it in lot of different way from be very active to put in a couple of minute every few day there be a lot of content and plenty to learn so the world keep unfold but it do not pull me in so deeply that i could not put it down whenever i need to,pos
use to be a great community now the forum be a lonely and desolate place many of the great player have leave due to lack of update bug their friend leave lack of response from the developer etc i think it be still really fun for new people just first start out i play nearly 2000 hour 800 on steam 1200 on flash player but for veteran like me who have have almost all of the top ut item and be in the good guild this game have become a sad shell of what it use to be,pos
enjoy play arpg and always push for that perfect loot to make your build the good ever look no further while path of exile may not offer the most stunning graphic in the genre it be top shelf in every other catagory back by a team of faithful indie developer in new zealand path of exile boast bragging right of be by far the good arpg to give you full control of your character custom skill trait and ability through gear selection the ridiculously massive passive skill tree and wide array of skill selection the endgame be addicting as hell always motivate you to push you character farther and farther with improve gear you make your own goal and quickly find yourself grind hour at a time hook on just how far you can push you character into the endless possibility and then you get a new idea for a character and want to try that and so on con less than top tier graphic compare to diablo iii not perfectly optimise lead to slow load time and patch although it be always improve in this area huge learning curve due to complexity of gamefairly large grind to get to endgame for new playerspros endless character possibility that be all viable and rewardingalway better loot to strive for no op gear set gameplay always have variety due to a large number of random event style encountersendless endgame content lot of variety depend on personal preferencegood trade marketability to modify item in almost every way imaginable from your loot satisfy smooth combat,pos
early access reviewthis game play like a bad mobile port at least for the moment the frame rate and the texture resolution be low but the bugginess be high all the menu use drag scrolling and lack scrollbar which tell me ae have not even change the ui from mobile to pc pretty big let down over all but hey what more would you expect from a company that would rather release more cosmetic and quest chain every week than fix bug or build on the foundation of their already successful game,neg

the game be pretty fluid but the car control be pretty similar to the helicopter control and that really confuse me the feature to turn into a squid be a good addition but it do not really fit the moba style of this game the skeleton sister be pretty annoying with their catchphrase and the mouse control make the dialogue super long,neg

early access reviewthis have be my go to for over a year it feel like the depth of m tg but they have make it play smooth in a digital space it be truly free to play new player can quickly collect enough to have at least one very competitive deck and build up from there there be a draft format where the card you pick be add to your collection there be free repeatable puzzle available after the tutorial that start simple and go quite deep into the rule and interaction in the game the tutorial be just plain too long so if you decide to give eternal a try prepare yourself for that have some nice snack and a ball game to watch or something,pos
business tour feel like an online multiplayer version of the classic board game monopoly pro free to play multiple setting for different type of game no gadget quick 15min game and 2x2 team con in my experience win 2x2 game seem very heavily dependent on which team roll first i would like to see the roll alternate ex blue red blue red rather than blue blue red red non team mode do not have an option to choose how many player you want per game one other person can join the lobby and press ready to make a two player match what if i want to play with three or four player game breaking glitch be very common ex player disconnect sometimes cause the game to freeze indefinitely leave game button not work get randomly boot from game gadget enable pay to win mode game be still very new and it can be hard to find a match especially in early morning estedit along with the update more bug have be introduce even when you win the leave game button do not work do not waste your time on this game,neg

early access reviewi have only play a few hour of this game so far from what i can tell the game need a little work with rendering of people in car and snowboard when move the fps be ok but i would expect to get well fps with gforce titan card what s great the gameplay seem on par with pubg h1z1 if they have a roudy child looting and auto attach of item pick up make it smooth in the first few min to better enguage other player faster shooting and hit register be dead on no desynce that i can see yet the med system in this game be great no boost or special med to get back up to full hpthe strategy map instead of a lobby be awesome its by far the bad part of other game in my opinion but some may like it spawn in at the select point be awesome as well no glitching and take fall damage no make sure to hit 234kph to hit the ground faster than the guy next to you just for you to hit the invisible skybox and get turn in mid air all in all this game need some work but right off the bat if the company can keep up with the demand of its player base and smooth some thing out it have great potential for the first day of ea,pos
early access reviewokay so i have be heavily enjoy this game and i have be do well if i do say so myself the game i feel have a lot of potential and i hope that more people do decide to pick up the game and start play it more than the other standard br game right now there be a lot of pro and con that i can think of for this game but for the sack of time i be just go to list a few pro 1 class selection i think that this be one of my favorite option in the game be give the ability to pick between a paraglider mountain climbing kit and a snowboard along with a free minor weapon setup to start the game up be just wonderful and i think allow everyone to have an equal fighting chance in the beginning of the match 2 weapon play now i will not say that it be as good as pubgs weapon play but i will say that it be damn good for what it be and i hope that a lot more people realize this as well i do think that it need some adjust cause i do think that there be some latency between bullet when fight or just bad hitbox registration because there have be a few not many but a few time where i have dead center a sight down on someone not move and it just miss for no reason at all 3 lastly for the pro map size i feel like this be a very comfortable map size for what have be give to us especially with all the class selection option we get that allow us to traverse the map even quick con 1 sound clarification i have a really hard time distinguish where i be be shoot from there be a few instance where i just simple could not figure out where the player be shoot from because i just could not pinpoint the area of which the sound be resonate there be one major instance where i be be shoot from a house a block down but it sound like the player be damn near next to me 2 minor glitching i do not know if these be just glitch within the game or just game smoothing issue but i have have several match where i die because when i swap back to a different weapon it show i be on that weapon select but in all reality be a completely different weapon the last game that i just play i use a grenade swap to a shotgun and it show that my shotgun be select but in fact it be still my grenade and i feel like this be something that really need to be fix 3 hitboxe i feel like the player hitboxe could be work on just a tiny bit more in my honest opinion for most i feel like its comfortable but as the game move forward i would like the hitboxe to become a lot well and the hit registration to become a lot more accurate that about wrap it up for my review i do not do these very often but this be a great game and i really believe that it deserve more publicity i feel like with some content update and patch that this game could become a gem and become just a popular as fortnite and pubg but that s a long stretch and really depend on how hard you all want to work on the game overall 7 5 10,pos
it have turn so much bad over the last 2 year i join the game before 2014 the game be fun in the begining at first i say to myself well i will wait until i figure out how to play properly before eventually pay some buck for a premium account but soon i get it gaijin just want user to pay for premium vehicle or quick repair prem account without any benefit from it a prem account just mean you can place more badge to your vehicle and get slightly more silver lion after a match in game money to pay your repair if you get shoot that be what i would call free to play pay to win special ammo or repair will cost you silver lion so basically real money if you really be mad enough to play this russian propaganda game be assure you will get affront to the fact that russian vehicle plane or tank be the great in the world no1 one can defeat their armor or aigility be this true i can not find any wiki article that confrim that russian technique be outstanding back in the day it be unreliable and let us say their plane be bad compare german plane that be why i would call the dev liar but wait there be even more gaijin be just announce new stuff which be incompletely develop and balance old issue about bad balancing and bad realism be not correct the only thing you will feel in new version of the game be that russian vehicle be get strong to my mind this game be basically a russian propaganda machine and about the bad issue gaijin claim that there as not no cheater in the game it be not possible they say that everything regard balancing be calculate by the server well dozen of youtube video prove that yes it be true there be cheater so my conclusion gaijin be just another software company with the objective to gain money but in this case they lie to their community in every respect they do not wanna care about fair play avoid cheat or realism do not waste your time,neg

fallout shelter be a great free mobile game that get port to pc fun be aplenty here as you populate your vault with the most capable soul that can brave the danger of the wasteland while make sure they be feed and happy it certainly do not take itself seriously and you should not either it be just mean to be see as a fun diversion with no real bearing on the lore it will help if you have play the bethesda games fallout 3 and 4 as shelter have ton of reference to those two game with some quest be pretty much a trivia contest on these two game no major reference to new vegas unfortunately but i be not surprise it be the same game as it be back on mobile so if you have have your fill already it be probably not worth come back but they do keep it update with seasonal event and it do not look like it will go anywhere soon if you have never try it what be you wait for sure there be microtransaction but you do not need to spend a single penny to enjoy this one go forth overseer and make that army of stampede gatle laser wield comedian you be always mean to make,pos
early access reviewok so datum collection aside the game be pretty good if something good be free then you be the product mobility be nice and diverse glider snowboard and climbing pack big problem in my opinion be the bot the game auto fill a server with bot i would say there be around 15 20 player game out of 50 that be say it be probably go to get well as the player base increase but i would rather wait 2 3 min for a game queue rather than play with bot most queue be around 15secs ai be dumb as all hell and on top of that sometimes it glitche and they just stand there for target practice it be obvious it be not finish and they still need to add a lot of stuff there be only 1 map and pistol be for the most part useless there be no upgrade for them shotgun be also kind of useless as most engagement happen over long distance if you be scared about the game sniff around your pc you can try to sandbox it i guess or in a virtual machine i play it on an hd7700 as an emergency since my regular card blow out a few week ago and i get decent fps for such a large map i have be play it with some buddy and we have quite a bit of fun with some intense moment customization be pretty low at the moment with few clothing item available and no snow camouflage or white item whatsoever mostly dark color apparel make you stick out like a sore thumb on that white background,pos

it work fine as a free to play keep in mind there be some pay wall that although grindable would take many month you will never have a fast mount 60 inc be the base you will never have the good item enhancement yours will be half as good approx it be pay to win do not pvp unless you be pay or enjoy get 1 shoot the game itself have a kind of consol feel about it with only 8 or so spell on your action bar which be player choice but it be not much and get repetitive fast it take about 30 hour to get to max level then due to the daily system for the 4 high level zone where you unlock well gear and hard dungeon it will take a month or two to catch up to seasoned player character role be a bit odd compare to other mmo if you be good you can do the first lvl 60 epic dungeon without a tank or healer even at high level the healer be more for buff the other player than actually keepin them alive i e not a vital part of the team the tank have the same issue with none tank able to go off solo in dungeon it give the game an easy feel with little need for teamwork just button mash you do not need allot of skill to play just either allot of time or more commonly money it be still good fun it be just this game do not go anywhere there be no sense of accomplishment you will reach a point where you do not want to pay real money for next upgrade and the time to get it by grind dungeon mob trading be just too great to be consider worthwhile or at the very least enjoyable,pos
the late update be garbage you play on a team with 1 or 2 other human and watch your ai teammate do insane thing that remove every element of strategy from the game and simply make it a game of chance do you get more ai or do the other team,neg
  this review may cover both dota games dota 1 and dota 2 dota 2 in my perspective be just a rework of its original game dota 1 i have play dota 1 for more than 2 year before transfer to dota 2 however i only play this game because i think it be far well than the previous game it be but it be partly not gameplay the gameplay be just like any most other moba game out there that involve communication skill and the ability to play the game itself personally i have be a fan of moba game back then because moba game be quite easy to learn and its fun before move to dota 2 the gameplay on dota 1 be easy to understand because graphic back then be as simple and easy to understand and i get into it pretty fast dota 2 on the other hand have well graphic and the game be far more easy than before in dota 2 the gameplay be short because of how fast pace the game be compare to dota 1 which require right timing to actually execute a good play but they be still the same game that let you farm creep level up your hero kill the enemy team and win not to mention dota 1 need a third party software to play online at least in other country while in dota 2 its just download install and play control dota 2 basically have the same control as dota 1 but it have the option to let you customize to your preference you can now assign different hotkey for every button that you can use for your hero and the menu back in dota 1 all hotkey be quite fix until you use another third party software to modify them community well its like in any other moba game out there it be either the community be good or bad but honestly what really make the dota 2 fall currently be the rise of toxicity among player since the game be free more and more player be create more account that let them play whenever they want if one of their account be ban other thing since dota 2 be a valve software you can actually make money by play the game the game have an inventory system that let you store a certain hero piece of equipment or tool that let you customize those equipment and even ticket that enable you to watch a certain tournament in dota 2 itself i still watch on twitch though with these item that you can receive through game drop you can actually sell it in the community market for steam wallet you can also make more of the item you get by trade with other player also dota 2 have its own workshop which you can visit to check out other gamemode map make by other player in the dota 2 community back in dota 1 you can only download the map make by other certain player in the community also create design new item which can be implement into the game if the propose item be approve by player and the developer final note although dota 2 be a great game it have it drawback specifically the community which make dota 2 itself i mean how do you play this game without player right even so its generally fun especially with your friend dota 2 be hard but there be a huge reward to those who commit i recommend this game to people who like multiplayer moba game i guarantee you its worth it despite the trouble it may bring,pos
pros good graphic game have good performance indepth controll without be hard to learn great vehicle variety indepth damage system con excessive grind that can cost you week without bosster for a signle vehicle later in the game hard cash price start at roughly 5 but can go up to 40 50 later in the game team balance be terrible with one team roll over the other 75 of the time game mode be uninspired mostly point capture for ground vehicle air plane mode be either kill all the ground target or point capture do not try to destroy basis you will waste your time and will not contribute to victory at a significant high risk 1 base equall roughly 3 5 tank mg emplacement team mate be not encourage to help you but to sacrifice you espicially if you be play a big bomber spawn kill have be a problem for year in this game but have never be adresse so i be go to assume it be desire by the developer to kill you 3 second after you spawn without a chance to fight back it feel like the fun thing you can do in this game be not the one the game want you to do,neg

i be just drool be able to fly in the heli and plane in the game i be no pilot no nothing but just fly in dcs make me feel good i be not really sure whether it be realistic or not well it be hard to fly and plenty of thing to take note just to fly so i guess it be more realistic than the other but how each plane be structure to its detail just make the whole game sim really cool note not for those who wish to get on and just fly you can with some of the plane but even then you will not start do really special thing in an hour or two you may even have trouble land even after 1 week depend on how good you be at least i be more on the casual side do not follow my steam time here i switch over to use the official launcher for the game,pos
early access reviewloade screen simulator team up with queueing simulator and decide to hire that one guy from babelfish too you have become 10 level on a more serious note if you think revelation online have poor localization this game ask you to hold its beer spend a vast majority of the time try to even get the game to even run past the splash screen then try to actually get into the game then fight past the performance issue you may eventually end up be just as confused as me when you even attempt to read your skill description when you end up play a game and just push button to see what happen not even want to look at your skill tooltip in order to avoid be even more confused than before you kind of know something be wrong i would wager the english patch for the japanese version be more localized than this hot mess edit for clarity i put in for a refund avoid until the game be patch up with actual english translation and well optimization if that even happen,neg

early access reviewgreat battle royale game very good sound decent gun variety pretty good movement the pack feature be my favorite in any battle royale game so far especially because i myself be a big fan of snowboarding though it would be cool if you could choose whether you want to snowboard or ski in the skiing pack the health system be my favorite out of all the battle royale game i have play and thank tencent for hitmarkers i like the variety of vehicle in the game and the fact that you do not have to rest the fate of the game on whether you find a vehicle or not especially if you be the farth from the safe zone you can possibly be like i mention earlier i like be able to heal up to full health with bandage especially if you take accidental fall damage and do not want to waste a first aid kit if i have to point out anything to be work on in the game i would start with switch weapon i can not tell you how many time i have die because someone see me and i try to scroll to my gun or switch a different weapon mid gunfight without any cover sometimes the weapon will not switch or you will accidentally goto one you do not want as a side note it would be cool to see the climbing pack become more viable to use in game other than just run up really tall thing and ziplining maybe make more thing climbable or give them spike boot to be able to run faster over the snow it would make sense to me,pos

early access reviewvery promising casual battle royale look and play like a cross between h1z1 and pubg but the hit registration be much well as tencent be the publisher and developer we have a sort of guarantee of future development but even as an early access title this be very polished and great fun the first person model can feel a bit rigid but the shooting be solid and netcode be excellent there can be a little stutter with vehicle but besides that i have not experience a shred of lag or any bug movement be very tight and responsive there be little else to say at the moment it be an excellent battle royale game it also allow up to four player to win in the form of escape the map with a helicopter but unfortunately many player will not allow you to get out without a fight even when there be only four of you leave and the fear of get shoot while approach the ladder do not allow you to let them approach you while make a run for it yourself but hey that be free for all for you hacker naturally do exist and especially now that the game have go f2p from my experience they be much more prevalent in the squad gamemode than in solo,pos

i love take thing apart to see how they work so for me this game have be amaze the model be highly detailed the control be smooth and easy to grasp and the range of gun to choose from keep grow by the day this be a fun little time waster the kind of game which you log in to for maybe a few minute each day to fiddle around in i be have a blast so far and would highly recommend this game,pos
what be raceroom raceroom be in basic english a raceing simulator not mean to be sarcastic this game be a all round good game whilst only play abit on this account most of my testing have be on my game review account so do not start complain that you have not play enough to write a reveiw because i have play around 10 hour altogether this game be for people that do not want to spend 30 pound on a racing game and play it evry once in a while it offer a range of track and car of the less know popular series you may still end up pay 55 if you really enjoy this game if you be just get into racing game then this game be not for you its like that for a reason while people will not go out there and then to buy a game wheel and pedel this game hate keyboard and mouse and standard xbox or playstation controller that be also mean to be like that after many fail attemp of try to play this game i come to the concluesion to go to my local maplin store and buy some extra peripheral aka wheel and pedel i see a massive improve of how many crash i be get the graphic of this game be good while this game be 2 year old my card which be 5 year old handle the game pretty well the shadow be nice with the option to change the day set which increase or decrease shadow there s nothing else i can say about this ecept download the game and see for yourself in concluesion while this game be no project car it come close to it if you be get start in racing sim and you want to get a feel of what they be like then this be a good game for it otherwise find another game to make it easy for you i hope this help in if the game be for you if it do leave a thumb up if it do not leave a thumb down and if you think it be funny well press the funny button,pos
early access reviewi spend so many hour with this masterpiece make a vary type of thing include but not limited to a bird a fly ship from treasure planet star war x fighter and many more this game be like a minecraft but with an ability to create a robot vehicle and destroy other player creation i will give this 10 10 for sure what be well yet this a truely a free pvp game there be no p2w of such sort its all depend on your creation,pos
the game crash after 20 30 min of playing i could not close it nor switch to other application i just have black screen i have to restart my computer no game be allow to do this in my opinion in 2016 i be edit my review since after play a while it be a nice game i have some expectation and they fulfil them it be worth a try if you be into game like this random run around search for loot randomly get kill by other peopleif you disconnect you can stash your weapon and stuff so it be like a bank i like that feature although i only find it after a few hour and i have already lose many stuff by then about the crash my game still crash once or twice per hour but you do not lose your stuff so it be not that big deal but still annoying they promise to fix it,pos
this game be great it use to be an epic arena a place where you fail a fight and think well how can i improve my robot so that next time i do not loose this fight it be great you would progress not because you play more but because you become more skilled at the game then they decide that be not user firendly of course if you have to learn something to get good at the game less people will be interested result in less money for you now the game be a to the question you ask yourself before what can i do well the only viable answer be either buy premium or farm money in order to get the next weapon tier nothing more skill be go build skill be go there be only money,neg
product receive for freefirst of all where be the sound the sound be not automatically enable this game seriouslyin all the game i have ever play never have the game throw me into the game without sound could you atleast tell us that we have to enable sound second the game crash and alt tab at random which really mess up my chance of unlock other gamemode which bring me to my third point really i have to do something just to unlock the fun part the fun part the fun part of the entire game i be not even level 2 yet and this game already suckszero star for this gamemaybe if you fix these problem before release it it would have be an actually good game,neg

team fortress 2 the most fun you can have online well it sure use to be that way use to be you could join your friend with a single click or hop into any server of your liking at the press of a button then valve decide that have fun be no longer what team fortress 2 be about and force everyone into a competitive format complete with rank and statistic sure you can still use the market gardener to give a meddle medic the surprise of his life but you will be drag down your score and you know it since the meet your match update the fun have go out of this game enough for me to stop play it be fun while it last i guess and perhaps maybe one day valve will realize the enormity of their mistake we can but hope,neg

early access reviewgreat game like world of warship but in space and without the insane grind i hope the developer will market it more aggressively like partner up with a well know franchise and release ship relate to that franchise e g world of warship and arpeggio,pos
this game have litterally turn me from a fps ps4 player into a bloody clicker game player but i love it very addictive and lot of thing to unlock my hour speak for themselves,pos
overall a good game i would recommend to anyone look for anyone who d like a little more action in their moba as compare to dota 2 and lol smite camera and ability style allow it to put player more in the action and therefore have faster pace gameplay while not compromise the strategy and depth of item in a character build pro excellent character selection 85 and count all with interesting passive and active ability pretty consistent update every other tuesday with patch note usually release every other thursday friday free to play anything that matter can be unlock through play the game actually have some pretty beautiful graphic and view especially since every map be inspire by some sort of mythology have more than one map see p s too long to explain herecon because of the amount of item absolute newbie can find it difficult to pick up i do some god may feel unfair to new player especially anubis or loki with practice however both be merely nusiance community can be pretty annoying especially in rank hirez will sometimes unnecessarily nerf god or item to the point where they be unusable but they usually do a moderately good job of bring them backeverythe consider it be a fun game that be best enjoy with a couple of friend to queue alongside you and help one another through discover and learn the build meta of each role and god p s the game have daily login reward that grow with each sequential login assume you login every day for a week you get something like 1 2 dollar worth of the game pay currency gem which seem pretty damn nice from my experience with other free to play game,pos
early access reviewgod awful game be unable to actually play due to every time try the screen be highley zoom in to the top left corner do not waste space download this crap game,neg
  this game it be gorgeous and addicting the grind be extreamly long and many of the vehicle be not balanced or historically accurate the model in the game be amazing look as be the customization the game be massively frustrating as many people not just i go round after round of be kill to never achieve anything i once play 10 round in a row of just be slaughter no kill no capture be snipe from accrose the map in tier 2 3 game before i could even do anything i want so hard to like and enjoy this game and it instead make me want to throw my monitor acrosse the room to counter point i have have round with many kill and capturess they be just few and far between have play most fps since the early 90 i be experience enough to know when a game just be not worth play sorry war thunder i be do with you,neg
early access reviewlooke at a few youtube video bout the game and really think it be go to be fun then i enter and realise that those one year old vid be from a whole different game not by gameplay but by progression i would love to try play the general part but apparently it will either bankrupt me or i will have to use a few 100 hour to get there,neg

planetside 2 in it be current state with the current development team have no focus or incentive to play other than farm cert in which to unlock more weapon battlerank be not a measure of skill but of time spend in game squad and platoon level play be useless in the game with its current scale as large outfit will redeploy quickly to hold off an attack with no way to delay or intercept their reinforcement take and hold a base be meaningless outside an alert and the small number of continent and ease of redeploy mean ultimately that fight only occur at the extreme end of the scale either ghost cap no one to fight or zerge oh god my frame rate be 5fps grenade and rocket be not be render and my shield be not regenerate this could have be an amazing game but i fear the community for it will be long dead before it will reach it be full potential,neg
have spend some time around the various racing sim i can say this be not the most realistic not the good look and not the good feeling force feedback sim out there but currently it be my favourite the game be free but you have to pay for content like car and track consider that you probably will have a few favorite ride and some favourite place to race you do not need to buy everyting and with that in mind the pricing be reasonable just buy a point package and get the content you be interested in to get everything you have to spend a significant amount of cash but it be still cheap than play iracing or something like project car assetto corsa with all dlc consider the amoutn of content that be available now for the game itself the graphic be good though not mind blow but consider that you will be focus on turn that wheel and operate the pedal you will forget about visual fast the sound on the other hand be the good in the market hand down handling be fairly realistic though not hardcore difficult like rfactor 2 with good force feedback once configure properly though it be possible to enhoy the game with a controller a wheel be highly recommend now for the sweet part contrary to other sim there be a good combination of car and track you will not see stuff like 1 car per class or useless roadcar that go slow and spin out all the time no ferraris and sls amgs no drift this be all about racing and racing be good the ai be one of the well one so you will not get divebombed by crazy maniac all the time and the difficulty set will accomodate player of all skill level not the good ai in the market but quite good and most of all fun the bad stuff no night racing or rain not really a big deal since in other sim these type of race a cool to look at but mostly hard and frustrating perhaps the big issue to me be the lack of a dynamic racing line where the track rubber up in place where car drive and you have more grip there not really a problem but once you try something like this in rfactor 2 you do notice it other games raceroom also lack open wheeler and do not have many classic car but that be to change soon another thing be a full flag rule system be still to be adde at some point all in all of all the new generation of race sims raceroon seem most fun thank to a good selection of car and track and good ai if you be look to get into simracing this be defo the game to try other sim may have well graphic or laser scan track but not the ai racerrom have nor the amount of actual racing content we see here,pos
early access reviewafter about 180 hour of enjoy this game on and off and realize that the good part be impossible to grind for i think it would be a good idea to put some money into the game as much as a full prized game actually to finally get more out of it i enjoy the component the rng give me for my money but very short time after there be a server error that cause me to lose item have put money into the game this be really offputting but it would have be bearable if there be any support but after multiple support request and also make a forum thread in the official forum there happen nothing so my verdict be enjoyable game if you do not mind never get the good component but do not put any money into it until it be a stable game,neg
i play a few hand of this game and win them i have to say this it be good as board game go but lack when compare to video game it just leave me feel like something be leave out i never do like board game even when i be win all the time while grow up at least it seem to make some family member happy while play so enjoy be all i can say,neg

this game at launch be a piece of crap a piece of crap the like of which no one have see before unfortunately most people who try this game out have debilitating lag crippling fps and thus a terrible experience since performance update 1 omfg patch my fps with a medium of the line computer be 60 all of the time often at 100 if you try it back at launch and could not play i would heartily recommend you fire it up as far as the gameplay ps2 be insanely fun the vehicle in this game be fun to drive the gunplay be very responsive and overall the progression be very good you could argue that the game be p2w but only until you learn how to make cert efficiently the dev in the game be very responsive on their forum or reddit and crippling bug be usually patch next day with medium one be patch within the week this be a huge game so there be many small bug but they seldom be more than an annoyance there be very few hacker in the game or at least one that be around for more than a week or so aimbotting use to be very prevalent but have die down the only real form of cheating be lag switch now which be very hard to detect probably the bad part of this game be the balance of both the faction and the weapon in essence one faction nc have be at a disadvantage for more than 6 month by almost all statistic and yet have receive very little in the way of major buff or nerf i be not part of this faction so i be not just qqe it be pretty widely know by those who regularly like to peruse stat in addition cheesy weapon that allow one to farm cert very quickly be frequently put into the game make by overbuffe that cause massive unrest in the community the forum warrior ism in this game be very strong lead to a flavor of the month as they be later nerfe these weapon will make you mad regardless of your rank but if you stick with it you can be that bastard if you can get past your first couple hour join an outfit play with your squad and learn the rope you almost certainly will have fun with this game,pos

early access reviewthis game get too much hate just because it have a rough launch what game do not have a rough launch especially when we be talk about early access yes there be still bug yes there need to be some balance change yes they need to add some content but remember that this be early access the developer have be on top of this game like noone have ever do for any game release hotfixe bugfixe balance change and content 15v15 every day every single day this show their commitment to make this game work and the fact that every comment be negative and now its mixed show how good their work be yeah it still need much work to become a game that will hold its people but the dev be move to the right direction always hear what the player say for me the fact that the action combat be miss be a big turnoff hope they will add it soon but once you get the hang of the combat system its all cool great storyline i mean one of the good i have see in an mmo in my opinion keep up the good work,pos
it be a great game but once you get everything unless you be very creative to do stuff on your own or you have a community of people to build with this game become very boring and it pain me to say this even if i buy every single dlc and recipe pack in the game look forward for the next big thing that creativerse have to offer so that i can come back to it and get hook one more time i want adventure in my own world i want that rare item become even rarer i want to work hard in order to have everything i want rather than to just keep chest full of every item but i still love the game,pos
smite feel like a really great game for a long time 700 hour play outside of steam btw but it feel like it fall short somewhere along the way smite have always feel like the easy moba to play if you be bad at something like lol i use to hate mobas with a passion but smite help me get into the genre so i be thankful i guess the good way to explain it would be if you hate mobas but really want to give them a chance smite be probably a good place to start personally i be do with this game it feel like they be try to hard to please their audience with cringey anime theme and that be come from a weeb not only this but several balance issue and no real focus on those issue just more skin,neg
run simulator 2016pros zombie be easy to kill plenty of weapon to find do not die of hunger currently player count be suprisinly highcon barely any zombie or player interaction so you be basically alone the whole time confuse server join and menu stamina be so low for how far you have to run zombie suckat kill you weapon spam make any noob able to kill even an experienced player i get 3 player kill and 2 zombie kill in the first fifteen minute of play the game horrible graphic and texture,neg
early access reviewif you be to ask me around 2 patch ago be this a game i should play i would have say yes yes and yes i be not a huge fan of battle royale game and after find this game i put in some good time into the game i even put it as my favourite game on my steam profile after the new update s they change the game completely it be a fun rpg style br game you could choose your class and have your own weapon and power for a certain class so a hunter would have a bow an assassin would have a sniper and so on after the update the game take a huge 180 and become horrible the looting class and gameplay system change game be not fun after so i give up maybe if hi rez would actually listen to the community and make their game s better i may just join back,neg
it s a good game the gameplay be similar to diablo damazing plot incredible quest and good history the only negative in this game be when you start the game it long time to begining,pos
do not let the steam hour decieve you i have play over 4k hour of this game i start play poe on the 9th of february 2012 at that time the game be in close beta it be hard to get a key to get in i have be play the game on and off ever since first i would like to start with some pro and con unlimited replayability insanely fun difficult to master very good economy system it pay off to play with friend well make microtransaction system desync start off slow if you be a beginner the game be very big it consist of 3 act feature 3 difficulty plus an end game map system with a level cap of 100 it even come with race and recently they have include special league with special format and gimmick that the normal standard and hardcore version do not have the game feature one of if not the big passive tree in all of video gaming it be a very big thing it be what make path of exile what it be all of the different combination of skill and passive you can do be endless you will never do every single combination skill be not grant through the tree skill be give to you use different gem which be give to you through complete the game story line and find them by kill thing the economy system of poe be very interesting it consist of orb that you will find while kill thing these orb be the currency for a list of all the currency click here www pathofexile com use these orb you can trade for different item with other player aswell as with npc inside of the town or your own hideout well how do ggg make money of this game ggg make money by their fantastic microtransaction model it be all cosmetic with some convinence item stash expansion these be a great way of support the game if you dislike the cosmetic the game be hard it be not easy to play and it be definetly not easy to adapt to the desync and such you will atmatmatmatm your first character up i recommend visit the poe forum at first and find a build label cheap and then follow that for your first character play with friend definetly pay off as it make the grinding a bit less tedious and it generally make the leveling phase alot more enjoyable the game even give you a 50 increase drop per person in your party overall the game be alot of fun with very few flaw big one be the desync but if you enjoy play arpg or if you dislike d3 this game be definetly worth try out and if you never have play before do not play on standard it be practicly the dumpster of all league,pos
really good game with massive battle like convoy and village battle or just battle that happen to be anywhere all the time i think this be always script but the good thing be nothing be script it be all human player work together,pos
product receive for freeh g be for me personally the good ww2 free to play game ever honestly i will recommend this game because i would be lie if i say i do not have fun in the nearly 1000 hour i have put into it i have countless hilarious memory with my friend the physic make for some hilarious and memorable moment that will leave on the floor laugh especially if you and your friend be moron,pos
early access reviewi do not play this game very much but the part i have experience be very repetitive i t have a battlefield like gameplay but with much more variety in thing to do it have vast map but for some reason seem to fall back behind the big name title as far as entertainment go,neg
the key feature that absolutely save this game be auto play without that your semi pointless duel grinding would be more obvious thank to the auto play system you can forgive the lack luster card pull and reward the game give you overall this be go to be a very give and take yugioh game be ftp some of the late card be go to be here but then many card will never be here for balance reason even the basic essential be miss luckily because of this you can not really pull anything good with in game currency or real currency the urgency to spend real cash be lower and since the console version be rare now a day you just get to swallow that hard pill and play if you wanna duel this be your late most update yugioh game love it or hate it 6 10,pos
early access reviewthe most pointless game i have palye long time i shoot dude in back from 5 meter and he do not die be aware that if you trie find realistic shooting then you do not get it from this game,neg
early access reviewbless online have a lot of potential however this need to be utilize quickly to keep playerbase high boss territory war perhaps would help pro great control ideal for what i be look for unique party bonus which encourage team up helpful chat but go off topic a lot help section con poorly optimize game very laggy 16 gb ddr4 3000mhz i7 7700 gtx1070 be my spec translation be very poor little attention to detail random server outage which be expect from a new game need more content ie more daily to earn more gold etc boss drop guild be not use to the extent you would expect in mmo need more of a farming afk farming,pos
early access reviewvery enjoyable battle royale game hitboxe be questionable and you encounter frequent bug but overall it be a well construct game can not expect it to be perfect yet cos it be still in alpha,pos
this game be probably the bad i have ever play first of all the graphic be bad than minecraft then there be the whole sprinting thing even while sprint you go as fast as my grandma after thanksgiving terrible gameplay too you can hunt about 5 animal without pay a ridiculous amount to hunt other animal 100 10,neg
since this be one of those review that show the complaint of a player who have spend infinite hour on say game review i must justify my intention the reason i criticize smite its because of its company hi rez which i think have peak its maximum level of disrespect for the community and greediness in their marketing what hereby i be go to give be a definitive sentence on every game make by hi rez a silent agreement by many people on reddit hi rez forum and critic alike that the marketing have ruin what have once potential for be a solid game why now cause we confirm suspicion about hi rez thrice with the bandwagoning of hot trend through the creation of paladin battlegrounds realm royale and of course medusas smite deathmatch smite like every game of hi rez have always be a cheap theoretically speak alternative to far more successful mobas like league of legends hero of the storm and dota 2 even take some of its design with clever change like chernabog off varus and artemis off windrunner but the fact hi rez have be inspire by its rival be not the real problem the problem be how smite feel when play which translate to purei will list the problem in the format of problem reaction to highlight the attitude hi rez have show to its fanbaseproblem smite have always be plague with too many bug by a moba standard more to the like of a close beta despite supposedly be a full game with crash packet loss fps drop client crash ram overheatings and every variety of visual bug especially on featured gamemode often follow by afk penalty despite be innocent reaction everything have be shrug off silently blame it to the one suffer and the problem persist since releaseproblem the toxicity of the community and you have my word i play both lol and dota 2 a lot overwhelm the one of the two colossus put together with afk at the fountain intentional feed voice command spam chilling toxicity with death threat and heavy insult this be amplify to ridiculous level when play conquest apparently the vietnam war due to the treatment to newcomer which cause a vicious cycle of people not learn due to toxic and toxic insult noobs because of people not be allow to learn not to mention the hilarious be sarcastic here matchmaking that have yet to find a fix on any rank bronze with master be a common antic by hi rez reaction hi rez ignore these claim never update their report system which be useless unclear and non function and many member in the forum have show no empathy in the various forum as such you can be as toxic as you want because you will never be retaliate against this be a thing that be also abuse through voice chat which should you be this stupid to play this game i suggest to deactivate it in the option forever aside from those two problem there be also intricate one like balance and marketing system there be not an agreement about what criterion smite use to balance their game however there be many proof of how many break mechanic have be keep in and how release god be always overpower like the infamous case of bellona and artio for champion hasten fatalis and frostbound hammer for item or even skill part which be simply ridiculous like bacchus insane value despite be a guardian odin rework ring of spear not have counter until last season or more recently sobeks invincibility when use the ultimate as for the marketing smite apparently seem to have get away with the lootbox method for cosmetic which seem to be defend as right because they be cosmetic meanwhile 80 of the skin be bar away from direct purchase and be lock inside lootboxe with many and much useless garbage item create and put ad hoc to lure the whale to spend lot of money money which do not improve hi rez braindead decisione the average be 60 item and a roll cause it be gamble after all be worthy 200 gem the real money currency pve mode adventure and skin be always the main focus smite want you to grind endless hour or give in and pay incredibly expensive bundle which in many case they give only a small part and force you to give more money like the infamous da ji ratatoskr event as for skin you can bet they be go to give to mascot neith and bellona the most skin and will completely ignore most of the roster for them leave most god with mediocre recolor and outdated crap or in the case of zhong kui almost no one despite the continue vexation by reddit plus there be the shameful fact patch live stream be make on facebook and not on twitch or youtube and those for the 90 of the time elapse be focus around skin while in the precious 10 of the time god balance be talk about but the commentary be very stupid hype base and hint at a staggering ignorance of the commenter about how really those god will feel like the nerf buff or tweak as for the gamemode availaibility only an idiot would deny hi rez have no regard of anything but their conquest also one of the main reason it feel like be in the vietnam war and keep arena and joust just because the playerbase be already decay if by any chance you like clash or siege then you will also know that hi rez have project to delete them aside from the obvious scream by them at you to play conquest with the event which to further worsen the situation be extremely costy the skin despite look sparkle actually hasparticle and voice pack and be lock behind many other with the same problem the mission to complete them very often force you to play conquest and run into the problem i already list be the most cpu intensive hi rez free gem and favor gift on login have always be a very good excuse to defend the game and a precious weapon of the company to make you illude yourself they be generous but when you consider what be these gem for especially if you be f2p you will notice it be not really like that but most importantly be the base of an old system take by lol which have be revamp completely and which dota 2 can not have since they have every hero therefore make all of this an old attempt to give themselves good publicity and aside from that the grinding be really immense and the founder pack seem to be the only solution as for the queue time those often have problem of be delay by an alarming case of people not accept it be even long than lols and dota 2 fuse together on the positive side smite have do some noble thing like the booster and the level up bonus however those be really suffocate when consider the massive amount of selfishness by hi rez lastly the advent of new game to catch up with the trend instead of fix the already ill fate game with even more grievous bug in every new installment be the ultimate factor to the aforementioned sentence as such this game do not retain anymore that addictive factor that once have and with the leaving of bart and kelly it be pretty much over dear reader if you have red this far and you be undecided about whether to download this game or not know how reverse psychology work you be free to throw yourself in the bloodbath but if you be willing to follow a suggestion from someone who have waste too many hour here play another moba there be no well one everything be valid but smite be simply garbage like rust and battlefront ii this game have insult many player pay or not pay save your time for game of high quality,neg
tl dr at the bottom how should i start this off well this game be a free mmo hack n slash type game with a large skill tree and many build character you can make to destroy your opponent with when it say free it truly mean free the only thing not free or micro transaction be the trail certain mask as well as storage so in my opinion that really mean it be free because you be not force to buy anything to do certain quest or to proceed in the game it be a well rounded hack n slash game with very unique clean combat the skill tree be complex and a build guide be highly recommend for all new player it may seem a little extreme the first time you open the skill tree when i first see it i want to run away and hide under a rock but it be really nothing to be scared of you will be meet with people in the chat talk about 6ls and unique weapon and weapon with certain stat etc the only real learning curve to this game be ask people what it mean or use the poe wiki which for new player i would say be extremely helpful get this though i do not know everything about this game at all i be still learn a ton of the mechanic and the function of certain thing pro free to play complex intriguing passive skill tree all around great game extremely addicting and worth the download actually free to play do not have to spend money to pass quest no membership con a small learning curve than will generally take about 8 9 hour to learn the more intermediate stuff some great guide on the internet about it tl dr version great game amazing skill tree actually free to play so what be you do here go play it,pos
early access reviewso this game be a totally fine hearthstone clone with magic rule set for attack defend and most spell gameplay seem average watch some streamer before and kinda funcardgraphic be lame but well do atleastthe gameboard look like its from 2008 not able to actually clone hearthstone decent boardstyle but it do not let you choose your password 2 3 hour of card progress lose yes i do try mutliple random word with the ask for character but never get a green confirmation arrow apparantly it do not save your progress unless you make an account which this break game be prevent from happen nice one never again go to play this or a game of this company,neg
early access reviewafter sit in the lobby wait to find a match on the us server for over 30 minute i finally launch into the loading lobby then we all get disconnected from the server search again find a game and wow the gmae be really beautiful environment wise the movement be laggy from time to time run in place then teleport randomly the third person in this game seem to work better than the 1st person atleast in my experience in third person it be pretty fluid movement but in 1st person my character constantly get catch on object in house which be rather annoying hopefully game get more server or become a bit more stable then its current release,neg
this game be essentially trash and i do not even know why i play it lmao but i can not stop play it it be basically solitaire 2 0 similar to ogame if you remember that web base game from mid 2000,pos

check out our steam curator page and website bluntlyhon review for even review and exclusive content boldly go where no man have go before fractured space be one of the most polished and well develop failure in steam recent history if any game deserve to do well it be this one and yet far from do well the game have struggle to break 350 peak ccu in recent month matchmaking time be often measure in the 10 of minute vs minute and its only peak over 1k once in near 2 year for a game with 500k early access register user there surely must be a huge problem with the game for it to have such a low ccu or maybe not the most realistic multi user fleet simulation ever amazing graphic decent mechanic great sound design a very fair free to play system a wide choice of ship on paper there be no reason for fractured space to have fail the way it do developer deserve a medal with such low ccu and have lose over 99 9332 its user base base on the 500k user figure its probably even high by now you would not blame the developer for leave this game to rot and yet the developer continue to push out new content even launch a new co op campaign mode allow pve to go beyond simple player vs bot mission so if its so good why be it fail the game be the opening volley of a possible genre a space moba that focus on capital ship sound amazing in principle and be execute about as well as possible the problem be it seem the genre be not one gamer want or embrace worth a play there be plenty of free solo content to keep you busy but the overall long term survival of the game i would question its never manage to attract a large user base and with upcoming title in the genre it cold lose some of what it have already,pos
this game have bring joy to me throughout the year and maybe some extreme rage as well this be one of the few game i just can not help but come back to over and over again the value of teamwork in this game can be beneficial for hundred of other game too with constant update gamemode buff and nerf and mostly cosmetic item and the occasional new weapon that be not a reskin every fifth major update the possibility be endless as well as the hour you regretfully put into this game learn the different type of player throughout the game like free to play who frequently play as pyro and run towards you flame thrower blaze the class main who about other teammate not do their job correctly the friendly player who give you a sandvich one moment then unload their minigun into your back the next the random who accuse player of hacking but be just terrible the player who actually do hack and be vac ban within 30 minute and so much more there be so many thing to this game to like almost anyone could find something to enjoy edit just some grammar and whatnot,pos
i be a fan of car game for many year and i think this be the good racing game on the market today it be a bit time consume development and a bit expensive but i think worth every penny the physics be excellent very accurate have a mode get real with 6 level of traction control and full adjustment of the car and the track area awesome very similar to the real thing a good wheel be need as well,pos

i do recommend this game if you have a feel for minecraft and want more from the game but i can also say this game be not worth play until the fully update the game i realize from the 2 hour i play last night that that be it just minecraft with well graphic they should add a story maybe some quest maybe more of a playerbase system maybe aton of monster with special ability maybe give your ai a few ability a few bug like double jumping ect but nothing serious,pos
dota be my favorite in the last 7 8 year till the 7 00 now i want to install wc3 and play dota1 again i guess that be my only chance to get the dota feeling again it be not dota since 7 00 they should change it be name rip dota,neg
honestly i really never play this all much at first i have about maybe 30 minute into the game after i come back and see what happen with new item and such i now have 159 hrs in game yeah pretty addicting game i would say once you get the jist of the game it be honestly the good game deca really save the game after so it all turn well with the free gift and the bring back of old item mostly just make the game better in general ign pewpmaster,pos
game use to be amazing it now suck use to be one of my favorit game now i be unistale it tank use to be hp base it be not perfect but it make sence now tank be awfull with a modual system that dosent work plane be bust too the p 38 beat all the other heavy fighter easily the me bf 109 beat the mid fighter and the recon plane all suck so bad that they be equil infantry suck because russians have the bad gun equipment of the three nation germany have the most accurit damaging and advanced weapon of the three also when the game first come out most people choose the germans and grind all the thing they could and be over power now last thing that be break in the game that i be go to mention curency money be extremly hard to get you get 2000 cash from a decent game and the first gun you can get cost 25000 plus the xp you have to get first well gun cost the same as some tank around 250000 i even buy some gold but that 20 i spend will never get me to like this game again either fix the game or get rid of it because right now it be awful i be unistalle this game now so if you want my advice do not waste the time or space on your computer just do not get it my rating of the game 1 10,neg

the game be as optimize as a potato i run the game on high setting and 1440p re and on low setting and 1080p and it make no diference on the fps it go stable at 20 fps other then that feel like any other eastern mmorpg i do not like eastern mmos so iam bias on that account however when i start play i immediatly get that black desert online feel i only play for 30 min didint want to continue anymore but combat feel press 1 r r r rinse and repeat while stand still upon log in i immediatly get a login reward screen which feel stupid when try the game for the first time so all in all if you like easter mmo grinder i think you should definetely try this,neg
early access reviewthis game have a lot of promise they mess with the match making or mmr in late january and it be really pull the game down atm once they get the match make under control this game will be amazing right now this be a 3 out 5 star great team base play with tactical skill you have to learn as you go and a tech tree that be spot on however get a game together be gruele,pos
i recently hear about spookys house of jumpscares from word of mouth hearing that it be free download it as fast as i could but wait it do not work the sound be glitchy and break make it the most frightening thing i be go to see in this game if i press a key the game crash simple as that consider i have to press key to get past the title screen i obviously do not get far broken mess of code,neg
early access reviewthis late update be the bad patch i have ever see for this game this pass idea be horrid just create a shop curreny like league of legends no need to remove normal crate with basic item and tiny chance at high rarity item in the shop you can put all item some shop only one that be more special or something i will not put any more money into this game in this state and will more than likely play something else go forward,neg
i be sorry but if i want to buy a hunting tag to go hunt i would buy a real one and take my real gun track and shoot a real deer and eat it the concept be great i have no issue with the technical side of the game however the execution be terrible i download the game instal launch it be a little miffed by the launcher i sift through the game list and find 2 server i be allow to join seriously there be some kind of restriction on 90 of the server finally get in one server after 3 try spend a good amount of time track a nice white tail buck aim fire pop up say something like hey we notice you try to kill a white tail dear you need a white tail tag i be like alright that be cool you need tag then i see the price in their weird currency and the rate at which you buy them with real money yeah free to play i see then i see the mission and tutorial and think cool at least there be a way to earn in game currency to buy a tag to shoot a deer in the face wrong the tutorial do not count toward the mission what really so you have to buy tag with real money basically then use those to complete mission which reward you with a fraction of the cost of the tag right this have to be some kind of scam right like how dumb do they think people be uninstalle never instal again,neg
grindy unique interesting visual constant update customizability massive playing area many active and helpfull player and staff bad thing small level gap between player you can not play with them until far later in the game sometimes poor direction with objective possibly too complex for casual player take time to understand game mechanic overall fantastic game and i have not even be play for a while,pos
i have play this game for around 2 month now and have thoroughly enjoy it it can be a bit of a grind at time but what f2p game be not it seem to be a much fair and overall well version of hearthstone which i also spend many month play you get good value from the arena the story mode be something special which i do not see in many other card game and the rune system make it possible to win even when behind if you get some prophecys overall would rate it a solid 9 10,pos
early access reviewthis game be exactly what a free to play ccg should be no intentionaly slow grind no level grind multiple gamemodesand most importantly you get to keep any card you acquire in the game,pos
it be a fun horror game with a neat concept it look cute at first but if you keep play for a while you will see it be not all that cute i be on level 700 and the game give me some spook would recommend for any one who like horror game it be also free,pos
early access reviewi could play this game for hour just snowboard down mountain throw in the fact that it feel less sluggish better optimize and faster pace than pubg well i be sell my only major gripe be that at long range in which a sniper should still be effective you will see player stutter along their path rather than a smooth running motion this make long range battle a headache when this occur if they can polish this up i will be 100 satisfied with this game the hour of fun its bring me so far have reignite my love for this genre and open my eye to the mediocrity we have settle with for far too long rip pubg,pos
early access reviewcombat be very awkward and it constantly freeze for my friend and i we have hope the game be not as bad as people say it be but sadly it do not live up to our expectation,neg
the game be fun it just take a little more time for the people without cash to get prem if you be smart as a killer or a vig good guy you can enjoy the game there may be gun litter the area but this give all player a running chance yes some may say it be unrealistic to have so many gun all over the place but to me i look at the game more as a shoot and service type of idea it help even the new player get what they want and need and for me after be kill 3 time by two diff people i have decide to be a hunter someone who take the life of those to pillage and hunt live off of what other find but in this you can not just let anyone see you you shoot at night you give you be location away the sound of you be gun can be the end of you and that be why i like the game because if we be give these thing the way we use it will determine our fate,pos
early access reviewi truly be sadden by this game launch to pay 40 dollar for a founder pack that be make useless by the dev decision be silly let me tell you my story so far so bless launch yesterday the 28th i buy the game at around 3 00 est i buy and download the game because there have be a lot of hype and although i know launch can be rocky i be not ready for what be go to unfold i download the game and its a pretty quick download an hour or so and launch it for the first time it open a launcher and i can not play the server be down for maintenance and i be just stick so after wait for about 30 min i be tell to restart steam because they push an update so i do the update download and i launch the game and press play it launch in an odd resolution and be very small so i close it and try to change it in the launcher setting only to find there be no 1920x1080p resolution so i put it on the high it could go 720p and relaunche only to get stick on the bless splash screen for a while i relaunche the game over 7 time until it finally decide to let me in i get in and be prompt to make a character and that be probably the nice part about my experience be there be a lot of option for character creation remind me of black desert character creation bit i digress i create my character and hop into the game for the first time i be in the tutorial and get around 15fps the first npc i talk to have a very poor english translation it be wonky at good that be when i get to the combat system i choose to be a paladin my main attack be not leave click it be 1 r r r this be not an action type combat system it be not fast pace it be slow and clunky then before i have a chance to mess with the skill tree i be disconnect from the server because it crash as i reload my game and get past the buggy splash screen i be greet with a full server with a queue of over 4000 player it take me hour to get in th top 600 and as i be approach 100 i get boot to 500 again and again till the server go down again that s when i stop play and decide to wait till this morning the 29th and get in be well but as i get in the fps be so bad i have to wait 5 ish min for thing to render on my screen keep in mind i be on a 50 mb connection and i have a gtx 1060 6 gb so not a potato by far then once it render i be average about 20 24 fps i do the first quest of drop the dead body and go afk for 5 min and come back to a disconnected screen server crash again i do not claim my reward as a founder after i have find out if you for example claim them on a character on server 1 and do not want to be that character you lose all founder item on your new character and if god forbid you delete that character you lose all founder stuff forever,neg

early access reviewhold on hold on understand this game be in early access which be barely an excuse for the poor state of the game its very poorly optimize and will barely run unless you play with with the ini file alot of translation be also trash and i find the control clunky until i figure out a way to get a controller to actually work while make a toggle button for right click to rig an action camera on any class my god be it better this game tho its fun and its pretty even for the engine its art design npc and player make character look damn good the world be big diverse and nice to look at the story when you understand it have charm and to me be interesting the combat feel familiar but with a fun system to make it much more enjoyable while also be flashy impactful and fast pace this game have potential and can be great and just what i want a good mmo but it need some dev love attention and a mountian worth of optimise this can be a gem or it can be forget please do not force it to be forget offer advice and give the game a chance to develop more and pray the dev listen they be try now and ill definently check this game regularly,pos
early access reviewto discribe it with the word of one of my friendlist player look like wing commander 2015 its not exactly like this but it have the same flair its fun to play try it,pos
have one of the most fun combat system in an mmo i have ever play be constantly update with seasonal mod that introduce new area item and quest and have a very active population i also really like their f2p model and it be very viable for one to play at a competitive level in term of gear and pve at least without pay real money just by grind daily and seel item in the ah overall i find neverwinter one of my favorite mmo out there even choose to cancel my wow subscription over this game,pos
early access reviewnow i be probably slightly biased because i play the original adventurequest and dragonfable back in the day but i truly love this game this game be build with a centeral focus on broad accessability both in how easy the gameplay be to pick up on seriously even the most novice level gamer can master the basic of the games combat movement and quest in the first hour or two of play and the mercifully low system requirement do not have a dedicated gaming rig with a top of the line graphic card a solid state drive a 3 5 gigahertz quad core cpu and a funky liquid cooling system no problem this game could run smoothly on a modest netbook the humor be goofy light hearted and full of fun pop culture reference the art style be cartoonish and vibrantly colorful and the overall atmosphere of the game be one of fun and joy and you can not help but smile at the goofy monster and silly pun it be just easy enough to get into that it serve as a fun chill game for experienced gamer between more hardcore title but just challenge enough that young kid and more casual gamer will get a decent challenge out of it as they learn to play their class and climb up a difficulty curve that expect player to master the game mechanic but do not slam them with insane difficulty spike out of the blue this balance between challenge and comfort make aq3d basically the gaming equivalent of in shell roast peanut delicious and satisfy with an acceptable level of challenge to get to the good part and the ocasional bonus nut in the shell when you least expect it if you like me play the old browser game back in the day you will feel a rush of nostalgia when run into the old familiar cast of npc and will really be amazed at the job the team at artix entertainment do when bring the old 2d flash world of lore into the third dimension sure the graphic be not as shiny as final fantasy xiv or black desert online on the high setting the game be mean to be playable on both pc and mobile device with the side effect that it be easy on old and less powerful machine too but there be a ps2 era charm to it that just feel natural for the aq universe the music and sound be decent nothing to write home about but pleasant to the ear and situationally fitting character customization be simplistic gender hair style include main style and braided side lock eye color skin color and start class you can not switch your character body type yet hint weedle but you can switch their class and outer appearance in game and their gender on their character page on the game website the three class you can pick in the begining be warrior mage and rogue but with a one time payment of 20 you can unlock the guardian class which include the class and unlock a new area and special armor just like the other game in the aq family this be an aq game you can pretty much expect that down the line you will be able to turn your character into a werewolf or vampire and the next level of class and dual wielding for rogue be already be try out on the game test server sadly this game do not have multiple character slot available though so if you be go to re create one of your old character from an old aq game or an original character of yours in aq3d make sure you choose your favorite the combat in this game be simple tab targeting and currently you be mostly stuck fight one guy at a time even if more than one guy be attack you they be work on aoe attack capability though so that be go to be fix eventually as simple as the combat be though it be also fun engaging and surprisingly tactical learning how to play your class be key to success and survival and woe betide the player who drop their guard while fight regular mob a little too close to where an elite enemy either be or be likely to spawn no look this game and you will die a lot as far as the community be concern the population be pretty healthy you see a lot of player online all over the place and folk be pretty friendly in this game i be guess it be because there be a lot of long time and return aq and df fan play who be now in their 20 and 30 and it be a relatively lay back non competative game overall which breed a more friendly and colaborative atmosphere there be plan for some kind of pvp in the game however so let us hope that it be implement in such a way that it do not encourage ganker to prey on low level player or turn certain area of the game into bad neighborhood where you can not go 5 minute without some over eager brawler just spoil for a fight pop up to bother you with an impromptu and totally unwanted duel sorry if i hurt some feeling with that but i really do not care if your king fu be well than mine i be just here to grind mob explore the world and hunt for treasure some people see the possibility of random open world pvp as incredibly fun and exciting i just see it as an annoying interruption like the morning alarm clock go off at the climax of an amazing dream i want pvp player to have fun too though personally i think a karma reputation and bounty system should exist to deal with player who like to jump out and pvp people at random all the time too many attack especially on player below your level or repeat ambush on the same player and your karma reputation get so bad that there be a bounty get place on your head and other player can hunt you down to defeat you with no consequence to their own karma rep reguardless of their level to claim the bounty the good part be you can not see your karma rep score and you and people on your friend list can not see your name on the bounty board so you will not know that there be a price on your head until it be too late once your bounty be collect your karma rep be reset to neutral pvp people can still have their fun maybe more so as a subculture of bounty hunter develop around the bounty system and pve people will be happy knowing that eventually that annoying ganker be go to get his so yes i recommend aq3d i recommend it to fan of rpg of all kind i recommend it to anyone who play the aq family of browser base game back in the day i recommend it to people who have never play an mmorpg before i recommend it to hardcore player look for a chill out title i recommend it to people with old or less powerful machine and i definitely recommend it to people who be young at heart and have a silly sense of humor if any new mmorpg today have any hope of be a wow sized hit it be aq3d,pos

a good card game i know it be a bit cliche to compare it to hearthstone but the mechanic be very close so i think it be only fair to make some comparison very close to hearthstone in term of gameplay which can be a good a bad thing a few interesting mechanic when you lose health rune break every 5 damage and you draw a card so it balance the game when you be get stomp or you have only one card to play in your hand prophecy card can also be play for free when rune break two lane each with their own playstyle which make for interesting strategic choice card can level up not during gameplay i mean permanently upgrade it feel more fair and less rnj than hearthsone but still not as fair as magic or gwent generous when it come to give pack and resource to craft card a campaign with some cutscene and a solo versus ia arena mode it be free if you like the elder scroll universe or not try it out,pos
early access reviewi have play about 60 hour now i really like this game its beautiful in graphic but simple at the same time there be a few thing i would like to see fix which be the following1 when you attack monster you can run in circle around them and never get hit this be same for every monster in the game 2 i would like to see different weapon other sword and explosive like bow 3 i have notice almost every single server i have go to there be always huge patch of snow and ice small patch of dessert and medium size of jungle i would like to see more dessert personally 4 i love how you guy update this game constantly but i would like to see new item put into the game along with new area these be just 4 different thing i would like personally to see happen in game but i highly recommend this game to everyone,pos
early access reviewthis be an early access game that in my opinion be in a very good state here be some bug but that be understandable notice that this be not a traditional battle royal game there be up to 4 winner in this game also it happen in a snowy environment and have three player class which make a nice combination of feature in the game recently the developer add a season pass 10 which as usual in this kind of game provide cosmetic change there be fortnite which be more comic_strip like there player unknown battleground which be more realistic plus be the pioneer there be island of nyne which die because of be a complex game plus competition against the 80 ton fortnite mamooth and there be ring of elysyum which in my opinion be a very nice game well build also developer be really pay attention to their officel reddit forum that do not mean they do everything people ask just that they pay attention to player,pos
this be a highly detailed simulator more then a game if you want the simple of cockpit then the fc3 be where it be at with the f 15 or su 27 and a 10a if you want that full on clickable cockpit then the other module be where its at but there be a large learning curve like about as close to learn to fly operate the real thing as you can get,pos
it be rare to find an mmo that have unique combat system however many time while you be play this game will ask you to spend real cash to progress certain trait companion level finish a task in 5 min etc thus drain my interest at a constant rate the customization be extremely limited your gear will look exactly the same as everyone around the same level unless you slide your credit card the only thing that make your character unique be your face in the market all horse be at the same state except the free one you could always pay 2 million astral dimond to upgrade its trait around 40 the only outstanding horse be avalible at in game shop real cash only shop and the low price i see be around 20 i understand that the developer can not make money with free but 20 to make travel 0 5 second fast be down right outrage the mission be pretty much the same kill something 10 time kill something else 20 more time do similar mission two more time and fight a boss a boring boss fight with no strategy but to kill it until its health reach zero the mission make by player be the only thing that make a different in this game player themselves can do a well job than the developer to give us entertainment overall avoid unless you want to donate some cash to perfect world entertainment you will probably get a free horse or e astral diamond for it no matter what you do you will never be a decent player if you be a free player,neg

let start with the basic okay so the game be similar to the very popular game call league of legends well but since i do not really like i mean i hate league of legends i do not really plan to play with this game either because i hear that its very similar to that game and you know since i do not like that game why would i like this one after i play it it turn out that its much well i repeat much well than league of legends because in league of legend you get to play as like a strategy game camera position from above click to move etc and i do not really like strategy game either but there be some that i like a bit for example red alert but that s different also this game be play in third person mode you can play with a lot of good character but here they be call god because actually some of them that i know be really god that have be confirm by people in the old age who know when and so yes the game be really similar to league of legends but as i say its much betterthe game have get a quite good graphic it have a good fighting system it have a fair money system because here there be no pay to win there be only pay to skin maybe that you can get because skin be the thing for the god that you can get by pay for the game or by collect gem or at some skin favor that be use for the money itself in the game anyway or there could be pay to win if someone pay a lot for the game just to get all the god its even possible to do it on low level by pay for the game there be different type of class like in any mmorp game you know like those common class like warrior assassin mage etc whatever anyone say if you get to learn to use a specific class or a character then you can play well with that but it depend on you for example i can not really play with the class mage but there s a mage character like as i say a specific character sometimes that i can use wellso i think if you would like to get to know or to try this game i really recommend you this one anyway this game be really base on teamwork so the team have really get to work together well to succeed otherwise if you solo if you like go alone and try to do everything on your own you will failunfortunately sometimes there be hacker but you can report themp s you can play with bot as well there s a tutorial in the game you can practice etc,pos

i be a long time player whit multiple account this review be not about the game itself which be great it be about ew business model and how they be greedy some company choose to sell a full game at a full price and then charge for dlcs gun equipment cloth bundle etc separately other company prefer to make monthly subscription system you will pay monthly to have access to a full content game both be okay however some greedy company like ew choose to do both at the same time whit the same game of course nobody be force you to pay but you will have a limited experience even subscribe monthly you subscribe monthly and then you need to pay for every single piece of equipment you want if you want to have a full experience it be not monthly subscription enough if you can pay for it it be okay or if you content yourself by subscribe and play whit only 2 or 3 gun whit no cool equipment it be a game for rich people a money wormhole they want your last cent do not be fool by fanboy and their stupid argument about f2p and how this game be cheap,neg

early access reviewgoe back to the launcher which be a separate program than the game after each match be one of the weird thing i have see in a game the jumping vaulting mechanic be super janky why be kill trade with ballistic weapon a thing drop into a match without warn potentially in a field near no structure be not a good way to start a match the shooting mechanic feel ok the car be probably my favorite part they drive well and run people down be hilarious the bunny slipper and speed knee be op overall not a bad game but not worth a ton of time in this state,neg
early access reviewdo not get me wrong it be not a terrible game or anything it be just not as good at do the various thing it do as the game that it be base on adventurequest adventurequest world and dragonfable good i can tell they try to combine all the thing that make there previous game fun into one big game but it just end up not be as good at what make any of those game fun i be go back to old fashioned adventurequest i also do not feel like grind my way badk into the mid 70 like i do for that game all over again,neg
yet another pay to win game i be really not surprise that one of the greedy company manage to flop a free card game come from the same company that sell you the same game 4 time skyrim with the same or more price and never fix their game there be really no surprise this game be a major disappointment greedy payment model and unbalanced match with be match with player that pay with full legendrie nothing good or more expect from a horrible card game plus relly horribly optimise i can run ffxv perfectly and then this game sometimes take forever to open can not imagine what its like on phone,neg
early access reviewwhen i start playin iwas so excited then the horror begin i be kill by tank and guy with smgs and other high level weapon i be waste eveytimeand the bad part be you can barel xp do to all the people who pay real money and kill you in a flash and since you may no t want to pay the developer basically make it a death simulator for people no willing to pay finally in a personal not the only way i could get any experiance at all be to capture point and that s it because m start gun do nothing to the enemy overll ill say that its a money trap,neg
initial thought oh man this game be pretty cool i wonder what this super game be during super game you have fail the super game omg how could i forget this you have fail the super game omg what oh you have fail the super game wtf dude you have fail the super game i be get sick of your t you have fail the super game wtf you have fail the super game do you have fail the super game wtf you have fail the super game what the slam keyboard against wall a month later i will beat this if its the last thing i do practice disassemble for about 30 minute i get this begin super game do well last part on the magazine double click magazine by accident you have fail the super game w what throw desk out window all in all stay away from the super game if you wish to maintain sanity other than that piece of t i enjoy this game,pos
after see the positive response i think ok give it a try omg what a disappointment i do not get it at all i never regret waste time on a free game this much it have nothing else to offer then go through repetitive bore empty room over and over again you will tell yourself there have to be something behind the next door but there be not there just be not think about it there may be a refund for money now on steam but no refund for waste time,neg
early access reviewi do not like build in fortnite i do not like lag in pubg i do not like 2 tap in h1z1 so i guess this game be it play only 7 game so far but it feel good to shoot someone down from the heli ladder and enter it myself,pos
racesim the people who make this game have they ever really drive a car in real life i do not think they have i have both on road and track and car do not behave like that i have play racegame since i be 10 year old i be 35 now and this may be one of the bad one yet when it come to racesim anyway and there be something wrong with the control there wonky or something can not explain what it be but there be something seriosly wrong with them maybe its well with wheel and pedal but with a gamepad it suck free 2 play more like a f2p demo i do not recomend this game,neg
early access revieweh with the game be in early access i pretty much expect bug etc do not get me wrong i do enjoy this game but this game need quite a bit of improvement first off we need well server or at least be able to see what the ping on the server be i be annoy with enter in to a server and it lag quite hard on me time to time and go back to smooth etc what ever you do do not aim down your sight i experiment with it and when i be aim at an enemy with my iron sight right on the person just to see all my bullet fly up in to the sky shoot the roof of the building so you may as well just shoot from the hip if you get shoot in the head with any gun pretty much you will fall over dead every time so if you run across a hacker aimbotter there be go to be no way to exactly even be able to get enough time to even kill them besides the fact this game have a spawn kill element in it though on the bright side at least it be not p2w and you get a large variety of gun but you just need to be able to get plenty enough kill to earn the money in order to have the gun you want as my personal favourite be the asval so despite the lag and spawn kill element the game can be quite fun and possibly have potential in the near future so i guess i can recomend it i atleast have a lil bit of fun on the game,pos
creativerse be a fun way to massage your creative muscle and make some awesome model my hope be that soon they will be make working model such as vehicle that actually move weapon that really fire etc etc the mechanic seem to be there good work team keep at it,pos
feel like i be cheat use the steam vers of this game so i be go to play this how it be ment to be play and that be by smartphone those who play blitz on steam and the window 10 ver be just make a poor excuse by play this version against people who be at a severe handicap i say remove this from steam and get rid of the pc user base off the mobile ver all together there be a pc version of this game and it be ment to be play on pc not this the only reason for this to be on here be to encurage the pay to win aspect that be not present in the pc version and increase their profit gain not bad for them i agree and i understand why they do these thing but its not right to mix mobile with a pc user base hince my digusting 63 win rate at almost 2000 game on this new account alone and a 53 winrate on mobile,neg
i just want my gem back i still like the game also from a business point of view the more gem people have the more likely they will spend money so if they want an ur at 2 copy and their gem get a single copy they would be for more willing to spend money for the second copy if they do not have enough gem to even get a single copy they will not spend any money do konami even do market research,neg
early access reviewi do not see how this game have any less rng than hearthstone 75 card in a deck more incosistency in draw plus mana flood screw which mean it be not unusual to draw nothing but mana 5 turn in a row or do not draw a single creature in your aggro deck for 10 turn if you be ok with watch your opponent play while you can not do anything because you get screw on draw this game be for you it be a shame because it could have be so good,neg
frantic flashy and fun this game test your relfexe and skill as you make your way through the realm of the mad god the aim the aim of the game be to level up accumulate load of fame and to defeat oryx the mad god like i love this game because it be fun and a good challenge it be also surprisingly fun to play with a friend the guild system be well design and easy to use run dislike while their be a few fault with the game there be main problem number 1 it be very flashy and in your face especially in the godland so if you have get epilepsy i would not advise go to the godland if you want to get this game number 2 you have to pay to get anywhere in this game summary overall i would reccomend this game but only if you be willing to pay a little bit there do,pos
this game do not really need any review it speak for itself for eleven year already and get only well with time whether you want fight enemy trade item capture point open crate push cart wear hat or even create your own stuff there be a place for you so if you be still outside of the most fun you could possibly have online it be time to join,pos
first off i want to say this game be amazing graphic be amazing gameplay be amazing there be some bug here and there like bird glitche in the sky after be shoot animal get stick in tree and rock but what game out there be 100 perfect it be a money grabber for sure item can get pretty expensive if you want to hunt more than guest list animal every week they have two new animal add to the guest list on a rotation so it be not the same animal forever i prefer classic over cotw because cotw be more of a arcade with ton and ton of bug if you want something to feel like a true hunting game this be the one to go to,pos
early access reviewi play it for nostalgic reason well it be in early access open beta for a reason it be definitely behind compare to modern mmo and it be not just the graphic,neg
early access reviewthe game feel like it be dead on arrival the fact that wait 6 minute for a match be just dumb and a single match only have like 30 person run around for the whole match without see a single person until the end,neg
overall 3 5 not terrible but well off play a different card gamepros great elder scroll taste various mode to play story arena vs you still have plenty to do against ai not too difficult to get into you can choose to play it completely free story mode offer many reward have two lane neat prophecy system that allow you to draw a free card when your health pass certain interval you can draw certain prophecy card give you a competitive edge or turn around a tradecon story be not fantastic about average so be not really worth play for story just gameplay have same card effect as other card game just with different label ex divine shield hs ward es l life link mtg drain es l a lot of content be lock behind level will explain later feel like a lack of card the starting card deck be majority of all the card less to offer compare to other lead card game such as hearthstone and magic when a compete card game should attempt to equal or surpass in other way just overall this game just start to feel a bit bland after a while due to lack of wide diversity of card material too similar to other card game and level barrier yes i be aware that as a card game it should feel similar to other pre exist type but it just match too much the main difference in this be image the two lane which sound neat but do not add a whole lot of change and the prophecy system rant one of my major complaint be what i be call level barrier a decent chunk of content be lock behind certain level you need to reach to unlock it this be understandable to a certain point you should have enough experience with this to play more advanced stuff but be just overuse certain starting deck helpful to new people be lock behind need level or progress in the story arena mode also require even more progress and level although it do make sense in respect to the story there be also card that start off fairly bland no modifier that require you to reach a certain level in order to upgrade them this sound cool but think of it like this you get a new rare card that have limit ability since you be not a high enough level the game make these upgrade card bad with their craft system soul trap just like dust in hs by make it so you can not soul trap them until they be upgrade to explain if you do not want a card you can soul trap it for material to make card you want since you can not soul trap these card many be legendarie worth more material you will hold on to them until you reach a high enough level to finally disenchant to make this bad people can get actually craft the upgrade version of the card meaine if you be to pay or play way more to get more card you can craft upgrade card which you would get by playimg more and level up it be just a dumb idea in general i would prefer if they do not include it anyways that be my rant game just do not compete to other of its kind thank for read etc,neg
awesome yugioh game you can get card pretty easily as they be very generous in give out gem definitely not pay2win the pvp be very active so you should get a match in no time lot of cool event where you can get gem and rare card the grind be a bit annoying but you can auto duel most of the time constantly be update with new pack event character and more community be super helpful and friendly most of the time highly recommend for yugioh fan and card game enthusiast,pos

early access reviewi really want to like this game be a huge fan of tcgs but the resource system be the bad i have ever encounter i promtly lose 9 out of my first 12 game due to not draw enough resource which immediately turn me off from the game the absolute bad thing you can experience in a card game be not even be able to compete and die without play a single card this game need to fix its horrendous mulligan resource system before anyone should even think about invest time money into it,neg

early access reviewi do not know a virtual card game company could be so kind that you actually get to keep the card you draft imagine playing arena in hearthstone except you get to keep the card you pick dire wolf make blizzard look like satan win in this game be pretty easy since i have a strong magic the gathering background and i have rank very fast in both draft forge and rank if you do not like eternal it be because you be come from hearthstone and do not know how to build a decent deck without blizzard hold your hand with class limitation try use your brain for once instead of your cash and get this game,pos

i do not have a tremendous amount of time in this game yet but i be enjoy it so far that be high praise from me since i generally dislike mobas many other review have point out the slow pacing this be true however while many moba vet find it bore it be the twitchy frenetic reflex base game like league of legends and dota that i have never be able to enjoy the ship class be generally uncomplicated and it do not take long to understand the role that each play while some class be at an obvious advantage or disadvantage to other no support ship be helpless and no attack ship be insanely op in other word the balance seem pretty good at the end of the day it be free so if it look interesting give it a try,pos

early access reviewthis game strike an exciting balance between the complexity of game like magic the gathering and the accessibility of a game like hearthstone i be a huge fan and have gladly put money into this game to support it be development though you definitely do not have to in order to build up a collection even with three total set out pro easy to get start accessible to new player provide good f2p value it may not seem like it at first but once you start roll through quest and do gauntlet and then forge and gain rank in those you will realize how much the pack and shiftstone craft resource add up over time short queue i play at all hour of the day because of the mobile app and average a 20 25 second wait time in both casual and rank this may change as you get high mmr strong community there be a tournament series et and some pretty great community website the official discord server be active and the website rng eternal and eternal warcry be great to help out with determine which deck to work towards draft actual draft you pass a pack pick a card pass a pack et cetera barrier to entry be low skill ceiling be high when you start build a collection this be actually the most efficient way to collect card assume you have master both gauntlet and forge already simply draft all the rare and build the good deck you can after that sometimes you end up go 2 3 win or even more which be just ice on the cake since you keep your card and get the value of open 4 pack strong playstyle variety i be not talk which deck be tier 0 1 i be talk about the different style of deck out there you can comfortably play aggro deck burn deck midrange deck combo deck and control deck there be viable list out there for all of these playstyle there be even option within those option right now there be a control deck that play zero creature there be also one that rely on develop control of the board and then drop an overwhelming force of high value and hard to remove creature con the tutorial be e long honestly just power through it it suck it be way too long we have all do it and it be not fun but once you finish that and all the mode and option of this game open up to you it suddenly become worth it operate on a mana system like magic this mean you can get game where you get flood or screw game where you draw nothing but power or do not draw any power really feel bad to lose deck size be high this be debatable and lsv one of the designer have stick by the decision to keep the deck size at 75 for construct it introduce some variability to the game and make it hard to consistently draw the answer you need,pos

i have play this game for a while now and i be a light tank commander which be not to bad just somewhat underpowered how it should be against tank against infantry its quite strong which be good but the second i join as infantry you always get kill by people with fully upgrade weapon for example the m1 m2 carbine of the us be way to overpower i see it be use alot and i myself use a ppd 40 semi upgrade no matter if i have the jump on him he just turn around and shoot 10 bullet in 1 second kill you because i have a slow fire rate this be mostly do by pay for the game because progress be just painfully slow i try my good to get a well medium tank but the last 2 unlock i have to get be go so damm slow because you mainly fight against strong medium heavy tank while we usually only have light tank that can sometimes penetrate the medium tank but that take so many shot that it just do not matter since they 2 shoot us no matter where they hit us the game be just almost force you to pay for the game to have a good chance against your enemy,neg

early access reviewwhat can i say about brawlhalla fun and entertaining as long as you be play with your friend and not go to play ranked to get the high rank on the leaderboard while use experience from any other fighting game i will be talk mainly about mechanic and the game in term of competitive ranked match someone metione it already but i just have to write about this dodge and wall camping be mechanic that basically hinder the pleasure that can come from play this game dodge be mean to allow you to be invincible for one attack and to have a big cooldown however it do not work like that in a practice people find a lot of way to give themselves low cooldowns on dodge make them invulnerable to most of the attack and all of what they will be do be stay passive for the whole match and punish you for the approach wall camping be another thing that can raise your frustration to the level where it be twice the size of canis majoris google it up i take a guess that most of the people will think i be talk about people camp on the edge of the platform just to finish the enemy when they come nearby the wall of a platform well if you be one of those people you be wrong wall camper be people that hold on to the wall like their life depend on it they will be annoying with you by stand on the platform for less than a second just to come back before it be even bad because they do not have to stand on the platform because the wall be all they need to recover the jump dodge and recovery attack but one update force wall camper to start stand on the platform but it be still not enough to fight this plague however there be a glimpse of hope for rank match developer be work on new mechanic and change the exist one dash be go to be introduce and dodge strongly nerfe dodge will have big cooldown and the duration of it apart from that there will not be anything like momentum dodge dodge that can be do right after land a hit or when run full speed and because of that chain dodge series of momentum dodge that can be do by press dodge button shortly before the finish of the first or second dodge be also go to disappear in place of them dash be go to be introduce and hopefully it will punish the passive float people from do so unless you want to play ranked like me and spend some time read 463 hour play it just because none of your friend want to play with you i recommend it to you it be perfect when you want to play with your friend game part of the family or ffa because there be almost no possibility you be go to meet people that will be passive,pos

this be a wwii fps combine with rts general side it be free to play and if you do not mind grind to get well equipment and you like wwii then this be the game for younow firstly let me tell you that it be a release game but the server can give you a high ping at time also the dev be continue to add thing and update the game ok that be say the game be very fun to play but the grind be long and hard to progress but i feel its worth it if you enjoy this type of game and the era it be set in if you do decide to play hero and general it will be a big learning curve on the forum because there if not a huge amount of game instruction that go into detail so you learn as you play right so now you know what your let yourself in for so let me say that spend 15 on this game will enhance your play and fun 10 fold so have a good look at the game and expect to spend money if you want to progress at any reasonable rate and have more fun do it otherwise i hope you like to grind and grind hard the dev show their face now and again which be nice and patch seem to be come out at a steady pace but server do go down quite often due to update and teethe problem when you start to play the game be play on a partially set out worldwide map and each town and city as to be fight over at the moment you have to choose between american soldier german soldier or russian soldier once you have choose your side you can not change until the war be over between them on the general map so to win the war one team as to take a set amount of city throughout the world when the war be over you can then change side if you wish when you start to play you can buy multiple soldier and equip them with different weapon and you can the change fron soldier to soldier while in a match to suit the battle that you be in the battle that you fight start off in training match that quite balanced for the learner amongst us but later on after rank 3 they in be equip by the genral on the map they may put tank against infantry so as in real life not all battle be equal and you have to use your whitts and team work to win all in all this game be the most fun ever and its free to play and be a must for wwii fan but it can be very frustrating due to the game not be as good as it could be because its still be develop but imo its worth give this game a try,pos
early access reviewthis game be amazing have play aton of ccgs list of one i play include hearthstone duelyst elder scroll legends faeria mtg deck hero pokemon shadowverse and probably a few more i can not think of off the top of my head the point be i really enjoy ccgs and have a lot of experience with them and in the short time i have play this one it definitely feel like it be in top 3 ccgs duelyst be number 1 still it seem to be very f2p friendly give you a couple deck to start the game with you get them from do the campagin and honestly those deck be not bad as well it give you a fair ammount of pack early game and give that pack contain 12 card a lot more than usual that be also huge plus with game mode like gauntlet give you a really good amount of reward especially give that it be free at first get at least a good enough amount of card for a reasonable rank deck seem very doable hell even with the one it give you at the beggining i be manage to win ranked game consistiently and there be just something about the gameplay which make me want to keep come back more so than other card game thethat mana work more like mtg rather than hearthstone or simmilair card game can be a little annoying as it can you over but also add a little more strategy to the game for example since when you first draw they be always on the left hand side of your hand if your opponent play one from the far right side of their hand you can be certain they have a lot more and therefor not much else and it be little thing like that which make this game one of the well ccgs plus it also add some freshness to the game so that you be not always allow to play your 4 drop turn 4 and you may have to adapt to use some cheap card to combat with plus with the attacking let your oponent decide whether or not they want to block and with card not be able to block if they attack the previous turn it also add some strategy in that you need to know whether to attack and go one offensive or not so you can defend all in all i give this game a 9 10 for be one of the well ccgs,pos

as a long time minecrafter i kinda think of this as it be slightly fancy more challenging cousin lol the basic concept of grab block place block apply day night cycle of yay and sheer terror apply though some of the monster in this game far surpass minecraft in fear factor the crafting though be a hyper improved system of craft this and oh look you can now make this kinda push you to upgrade and find new type of block the biome also feel simply more appropriate in creativerse often see similar creature but one fit for that zone in color or style i enjoy both but i will say this be free the pro version may be an option someday for the cosmetic but if your look for a fun thinker building game that be free look no further also side note i will be start a creativerse series on my youtube channel soon so there be that xdas a side note true suck up block into a glove be crazy but hey so be nearly unlimited storage with no weight hinderance but all game have it,pos
only just start on creativerse but from what i can tell you be this yes its like minecraft its a block base game but there s something about it that just make it feel amazing learning and progress throw the recipe sort of teach you how thing work and what you need monster be sometimes challenging but reward its amazing this game be free to play there be alot of content to get throw you can upgrade to pro for advantage like fly ect but if you do not fancy that then f2p be the way forward love it can not wait to see what else be go to be add,pos

early access reviewi play magic the gather about 15 20 year ago with a couple friend never get in to it because i be not go to spend an absurd amount on card see this hey its free and think i would give it a try from the free perspective the local content be pretty easy go card and how everything work be not too difficult to understand even for someone like myself that have not have the opportunity to play these kind of game much the causal game against other player be also reward you start see some ingenuity and come up with your own as well make thing interesting once you start rank game i do pretty poorly some of it be luck of the draw and of course bad discussion due to lack of experience no doubt the complexity of the card and people play multiple race color deck make the thing more difficult to understand an example of this if you an enemy unit card 2 2 and yours be 2 3 you know your unit will win so you would choose to attack or defend with it after you execute that action card come in to play to buff their unit or hurt your unit and you lose your card without you know go in course the same could be say for the other team just know go in your go to need to practice and gain experience i play for quite a while have a good time i have like 5k of gold but there seem no where to spend it to advance from here and get well card and build deck it appear its pay to win on the ranked side of thing if your look for something casual and free the causal game this be a good pick good replay value ill no doubt enjoy revisit play casual game if they implement a system to be able to grind the card and deck such as be able to use the gold you get from win then i could see my self play a great deal more i would do a one time payment to buy the game to gain access to everything everyone else have if you be not in to microtransaction and play to win the scope of how far you can go be pretty limited but you can obtain casual entertainment out of it for free my motto be if its free its for me,pos

world of tank blitz be not a game worth even a single key stroke with this say i do not know how this game be even on the top 10 for f2p game wot blitz be a mobile game that magically make it to the steam market the ui and the quality speak for itself positive easy to learn control great for all agesnegative lack of map lack of in game curency game be 2 4 minute long no matter what the ui and overall graphic seem to be build for a pc run window xp the majority of online player be mobile player with this say find a challenge be go to be hard with you pay on the master race pc cost for upgrade be too much lead to unnecessary play time no rank system pay to win wg greed i can go on and on about these con if you want to play a wot ip play the actual pc version i can understand how this game would appeal to user with old system who can not smoothly run pc wot however i still believe this game should not be on steam and need to be remove as soon as possible on the bright side the download be quick so i be not upset when i uninstalle after 10 minute of gameplay rating 2 10,neg
i really can not recommend trove it be a massive grindfest and little else there be a lot of variety in visual but the core gameplay be extremely basic and if you play for 10 minute you have see just about all the game have to offer in gameplay mechanic there be an absolutely silly amount of cosmetic to be find and i can appreciate that they be largely cosmetic for example there be hundred of different mount but there be only ten or so that be truly unique in some way and those unique thing only very rarely give a gameplay benefit all the hat and face and weapon be randomly generate and you can wear any style you have obtain previously over your equipment so an ugly hat with good stat be easily cover up however all these visual do not solve the main problem with the game that be the awful power creep and scaling issue progression have change a lot since release but basically at this point you be go to be open rng lootboxes hope you get good gem that push your power level high enough to get to the next tier of content so you can get well gem to get to the next tier etc until you get to the last tier and content end not that there be new content at the last tier or the three tier before it since the game recycle all the content it have through all tier tier really only mean how big your number be the enemy and gameplay do not change many class simply have the playstyle of point at enemy hold m1 tap m2 1 when you have energy tap 2 whenever it be available with nothing more than that it get old fast and have to pay cash or wait for extremely rare drop to unlock new class be the pit plus because the game have be run so long the economy be set in such a way that buy endgame equipment from other player be far less expensive and strenuous than make it yourself you can spend day try to find and collect all the material you need to level up your equipment or you can just buy it from someone else i spend week and several thousand flux try to build up my gear myself and i get to where the stuff i need to make myself strong be unobtainable because i be not strong enough yet that be some bad design when i finally cave and go to trade chat it blow me away how trivial it be to just buy what i need rather than go through the design method to make them yourself i mean trove be just minecraft with less building and a mmo skin you can mine and craft and build but nothing you build really have purpose the cornerstone aspect be nice being able to have your own personal chunk of land you can teleport into the world and i have sink many many hour into decoration but it be all for cosmetic purpose i enjoy see what other people have build and there be so much that people have build there be guild world that people have clearly spend significant amount of time building and there be so many people play that you can always find something new that someone have build i would say trove be a childrens mmo it be simple it can be fun but after a while the fun dry up and only the grind remain it be more of fast paced and exciting than minecraft be but that be not too hard to accomplish if you really like minecraft and want something similar trove be a decent pick but it be just so shallow it be a good game if you do not want to think too hard,neg

fractured space have evolve rapidly over the last year and thanbkfully the developer have eliminate nearly all of the glitch and fail connection issue in the matchmakeing system the game mechanic be well balanced and it run great on most mid level pc platform the controll and strategy have be make easy to grasp for beginner but remain complicated ehough that hardcore guy can get invest in them pro fractured space be a qnigue concept at the time of its early access launch the orbital science fiction elemest and arcade phisics esssentally add a z axis to what would otherwise be a naval combat game the simplicity of naval combat simulator have incresse recent and fractured space initial idea be appear on other game like world of warship that say its still an uncommon idea that add a waft of fresh air to the steam market the typical initial learning curve be about an hour and the system match you with bot in initial multiplayer match so that you can practice gradually introduce live player who match your skill untill you become compeditive the typical match be about twenty minute but there be no cutoff timer so two good team can go at it for a ling time with the long match i have ever play last just over thirty minue con there be no single player campign plot or story to contectualize event in this game at all something it would greatly benifit from give that crew character with name and face have be think of alongside a lor of concept be that be include in the interface that show a lively world that we really do not see any of this be clearly a world that could easily have these element but i have hear no mention of them anywhere the turd in the carpet for me have always be microtransaction system because they be manipulative and nearly always result in game that require rediculus and protracted economic in order to unlock everything these game almost always have random number slot machine dynamic that keep you from only buy the thing you want and these game be in a near constant fight between the non pay playerbase that demans balance and the pay playerbase that demand a good reason to pay for extra fractured space show sign of this fight in its game store in that you have two entirely different kind of object for sale skin and modifier skin be cosmetic change to how a ship look and modifier be crew implant or booster which change how a ship perform in a give match you get a starter crew but no implant which mean that player who pay for implant early on have a performance advantage over player who do not crew and implant can be earn over time but a long long long time have buy into this early i have about half of the crew need as i have play new implementation of the game economy have gradually increase the amount of time between crew unlock dramaticly the problem be that the effect crew and implant have be minor to the point that an attentive free player could theoritically outmaneuver or out strategize a pay player which make the varous pack they offer kind of mute even when they have be on sale i struggle to find a reason to buy them because i can not controll what implant i get in the dedicated pack and crew pod can give out the same crew over and over in which case the crew get autotrade for dna one of the three available in game currency its design to make it exponentally more difficult to unlock the last half of the available crew option i can recommend fractured space overall but new player should understand that they be jump onto a treadmeal that seem to get long with ever update one which have alienate me as an old 90 era gamer and one which the young generation seem all to eager to accept as just the way it be i still play and i still have fun playing but i get irritated every time i finish a match and get awarderd what little earning each match give me as a vanguard player it take over a month of frugal in game currency save to afford the large implant or crewpod pack in game for free the thought of that alongisde the constant reminder of how you could just buy platnum and get it now almost mock me because the economy be make so that you have to buy platnum in tier that the random content pack all fall between so you have to buy more platnum than you actually need in order to buy the pack themselves if developer what to have microtransaction fine but please have an unlock everything option available so that people like me know exactly what the maximum possible spending amount be and can choose to skip all the randum number bs also just let me spend real money off my credit card for exactly what i want to get in the game if i want to gamble i will drive an hour down to las vegas and hit the slot at least then i have a chance however reomte to walk away with actual money,pos

early access reviewi hardly ever write review but i feel this game really deserve it so here go i have over 800 hour in pubg well a few of my friend keep badger me to play roe and since it be free i cave in eventually and decide to give it a shot i be incredibly surprised at the experience i have end up with i pretty much completely stop play pubg the quality of life change such as auto equip attachment onto weapon and when you swap a weapon the attachment go with it be huge also be able to choose one of 3 loadout to sort of cater your movement around the map as well as carry capacity be a pretty sweet edition but overall my favorite part be the end game a chopper fly in once the map constrict down to a very small block due to an encroach storm on this chopper there be 4 seat leave meaning there can be multiple winner some will rush the chopper and hope to not get shoot down while climb the ladder while over will have save up a lot of med and wait til the storm roll in and fight out the last survivor so they be the only one leave overall this make every match feel pretty unique due to the low visibility at the end at the helicopter aspect overall i highly recommend this game especially since it be free i can not wait to see what be in store next for this game,pos

i recently decide to give this game a shot have not play an mmo since guild war 2 shortly after its launch i be not go in with incredible expectation i have hear quite a few complaint about pay 2 win trapping as well as balance issue within the game but be willing to go in with an open mind the character creation be puzzle to say the least i in part already know i would be roll dice to create a character but the question be why make the player sit there and reroll dice over and over to get their desire stat roll when you could just let them choose instead roll for stat make sense in a in person pen n paper scenario where you get one shot at them otherwise there be absolutely no purpose except to waste the player time or to negatively impact new player who do not understand the mechanic then come the intro cinematic it be jarring to say the least i understand not every game give you context in it be begin cinematic but this one go out of its way to avoid any context whatsoever on top of that the motion and emotion of the character in the cinematic be jar i would say this be not due to poor animation the animation at the very least seem adequate but instead seem to be due to a complete misunderstanding of how humanoid creature interact with the world yes it somehow look that akward i be willle to push through despite the previous reservation i have due to friend and reviewer alike give it negative feedback as well as the poor first impression i have already receive from just the intro cinematic and character creation but then upon enter the game world i be bombard with admin notification that flood both my chat log and also pop up on the very middle of my character screen what be these message you may ask they surely must be important for them to be so jarring as to completely remove me from experience the game and try to gather my bearing right no in fact they be not they be message spamme to me by the admin about people open lock box chest and receive rare item these message be not only on by default but they can not be turn off or disable in any shape or form both the jarring text that pop up and completely break all immersion as well as the spam in your chat log you can not even make a separate chat log for just specific form of chat guild party etc that will not be spamme by this as it be on permanently in all chat log you create that be pretty bad right but they have to make a buck right well certainly okay so then if i spend money on some sort of subscription open a few box or buy some sort of premium one time membership then you can disable these message right no you still can not this my friend be how you do free to play wrong the pay 2 win be strong enough in the game already but then for them to shove unremovable message all over your screen that be there whether you support them or not this prompt me to immediately close the game and uninstall every shred of it i could find on my system i waste two hour download the game register an account and patch it but hopefully i save someone else some time and frustration if you value immersion fair f2p game intuitive character creation and story i can tell you from the very brief time i spend with the game you will get none or very shoddy version of all of these for context i do not get into a single battle before i end up uninstalle the game but i have over 20 message about player xxx get the everlasting hydra mount of smite flood my screen in that time,neg

honestly i love many part about this game but i can not overlook a couple thing about it tldr path of exile do not value your time if you have a carreer or family or anything else in your life poe be not make for you you would have to spend thousand of hour to get to play all the way through the game and that be horrendous in my opinion a game should be fun challenging and rewarding force people to pull the lever on a slot machine be not real difficulty their main goal be to keep the carrot dange in front of you and you will never ever find the game you want it be all about the chase and at the end you will have nothing to show for it what i love 1 the customization be super deep and very enjoyable 2 there be lot of activity to grind and feel like you be make progresswhat i hate 1 you will have to trade other player will do their good to rip you off it be a job to become knowledgable about the market so that you can properly price and trade item but invest hour pour over page of item price will not make you good at it some people play this game for the economy and enjoy trade and become stupid wealthy to them i say fine enjoy flip currency and buy out item to inflate price i will go play ssf except you will never find the item you need and you can not craft endgame item for a target build so either learn to love poe trade or play a different game hint play a different game 2 crafting be so absurdly expensive that you should never try it it be deep but you will blow every single currency item you have before you see the item of your dream you may be able to accidently craft something other people could use but then you have to find out what it be worth and trade it or play ssf and never see the great item you want to make your obscure build work 3 gating content behind rng so breach spawn randomly and then they drop a random number of shard and then when you finally get 100 could take 15 50 breach no joke sometimes they drop 2 the breach boss have an rng chance to drop a unique item they do not have to drop which be suppperr frustrating take me month to finall run a breach and xoph drop nothing be crush in ssf i can not just run it again another example be uber atziri i have never fight her i map fragment drop randomly and there be no recepie to trade them up so you will be wait for midnight fragment to randomly drop then atziri have a random chance to drop fragment for her more difficult version and again you will never get the rare fragment you need another example be shaper i have never fight him because i can not get the map to drop in order to fight him i have play over 1000 hour in ssf and still i be miss some of the shaper fragment sustain tier 15 be impossible i can sustain 11 12 but past that it be random that if you get the map you need the more map you finish the less likely the map you need will drop infuriating as all hell never fight uber elder or even red spawn elder not because i can not kill it but because i can not get the map to drop to kill his guardian why be prophecy weight by rarity you will get the same 10 prophecy that do nothing over and over again you will never see the one that you find exciting plague of frog and lose map forever smother tendril ughso basicallllyy it be a cluster of rng on top of rng it be a slot machine and all the skill in the world will not help you 4 party play suck people just rip through map in this game like literally a whole map like 40 screen width in about 2 minute then rush through the next one the game be balance around this and you have to go that fast to see profit there be not a way to go slow in a dangerous map and see the same return it be all about easy map as fast as possible you will feel like people pull you through the whole game this game have to be tune down so that the pace be more reasonable then they could retune the drop to also be more reasonable another problem with party play be the sheer number of sparkly thing and circle and ring and projectile it be be impossible to see what be go on generally everything be dead the second you see it but if it be not you would not be able to tell if you love this game i could understand why but do not pretend you love these part of it these be fixable problem if there be the community will to have them fix if you do not think over a thousand hour be a long time to play a game i think you have an addiction i be an avid gamer but there have to be bounderie on what be reasonable to expect your player to do in order to progress hope they fix it,neg

the thing that ruin this be respawn wait time if we die we should be able to respawn emmediatly without have to wait 10 20 minute just so we can play again it especially suck for new player who die very often becuase if your try to learn the control and every time you play so you can get well you die after around a minute just to end up back on the title screen wait for another 10 minute no one like wait to respawn and it make every game terrible 30 second wait time fine but 10 minute be just mess up it be like hand someone fake money and tell them to go buy something with it you just do not do it,neg
i just like it you can play as completly f2p or go p2p these two be both fun and can be entertain you miss out on certain hero and worker but you only need them if you maximise your output they be also well than normal worker which probaply take you 2 year they be also a little bit faster and if you play that long money spend on this game probaply do not hurt support be also pretty nice to me at least its fun but to an extend p2w its also nice that you can play on your phone and pc and browser facebook seemless,pos

early access reviewi be still very much on the fence about this game however since it be very much alpha i will give it a positive review for now there be a lot of gripe to be have about this game but when you boil it down it be an easy go all right rpg however the gripe will hopefully be put to rest when more update come out 1 die kill 1 die kill another dying this be a major gripe of mine aoe spell do nothing but aggro enemy and make you die faster you may say well just level up and get well equipment the problem be that the dungeon already set you to a particular level and your spell needless to say suck and it become a button masher 2 attack range now this be a pain in theto say the least you can attack at melee range but unless you be really close to the enemy the enemy will auto heal and you will lose your chance to continue to use spell annoy 3 grindfest now i do not really mind it in this game but you may the entire game be a grindfest and combine that with gripe 1 it become tedious and clumbersome yeah i do not know why i give it a positive recommendation,pos

early access reviewthe game start off with a few flaw like every early access game i try my good to look over the obvious mistake such as presette unchangable combo where they put a ranged taunt right after a melee attack or a skill that have bonus effect on 0 bravery stack right after a skill that add 1 bravery stack and many more but with every single patch lately the game developer just make clear that they have never experience their own game and refuse to put deep thought into it late example a skill cooldown get increase from 7s to 30 while the possible cooldown spec remain on the same flat amount of max 0 8s also the damage and balance adjustment be randomly guess by the team behind it and even though they really react fast to the community it feel like they should much rather take their time or fire most of their responsible people besides these horrible and hilarious adjustment the game show many game change bug such as randomly make your dodge ability unusable even though it be up and ready or make you lose rune from your gear which be not suppose to be lose while pvpe on the exclusive pvp battleground just because a randomly implement pve mob kill you there this game be a great example of how to add insult to injury with every single patch and i could just make the list of horrible bug and skilltree longer and longer as i just give a few very recent example above but let end this review with a solid rating of 1 10why not 0 because the game still have potential and eventually be save some day,neg

this be obviously just bloon td battle port from a browser game so do not be expect anything different nevertheless this be still amazing game i use to play this a lot on browser and i be glad they do turn it into a steam game as i use steam a lot more than anything now i love the fact that you have to actually play to earn your stuff in this game because as the more match you play the more upgrade you can get for your monkey which make it more skill base a lot of the time you have to make last minute decision to make sure you can defend against both game and enemy bloon which make it very fun i love that there be many different strategy and combination of monkey that each person can have a different way to play one of the only problem that i have with this game be that there be a surplus of cheater i be go for the achievement where you have to win 20 game in a row i have get to 13 when i be meet with someone who do not take any damage they let about 2 3 round worth of balloon though and this really annoy me i wish the developer would really try to work on this as it make me not want to play and in my opinion be the big problem with btd battle either way it be a great game i love to play it when i have free time so i do recommend this,pos

i have give this thing a thorough attempt ignore the other review and opinion on this game what i can say be that it be pretty much an outdated garbage heap with nothing to offer a player gameplay ie combat be complete trash messy uncomfortable and make it feel like a bad basterdization of tab target with a poor attempt at action combat horribly throw in the mix have play some game with hybrid play as well as pure tab targeting and action combat i can not recommend this game combat system to anyone graphic be on par with archage which be to say very outdated and limited seem though that some of the visual optimization issue some people be have have be clean up so it do at least for me run very smoothly though still visually outdated on top of this their interface though pretty standard have its own little setback and the setting of it all along with the subpar skill system make it less than desirable the thing that annoy me the most be that this game have an upcoming revamp version for xbox that use the new unreal engine 4 to run on i feel like in do so they have pretty much slap anyone who support them in the face with this move not be hype or have high expectation when attempt to try this game i be neither surprised nor disappoint i hope that anyone who read this will decide for themselves what a heaping pile of trash not only this game be but the dev who design it and continue to fail the player globally,neg
do not buy if you do not have fast unlimited interneti use to really like this game but now that i be on satellite internet it be completely unplayable game constantly lag out to the point of complete packet loss if i try to play it i have to keep quit and restart every 5 7 minute i only want to play single player the stupid insistence on require an online connection absolutely ruin the game,neg
early access reviewi think eternal should exist because people have different taste in life have say that i do not really support the old scheme of resource draw a k a land or sigil in this game the concept of mana flood screw be a problem that should not exist the way eternal manage mulligan be clever but not enough even if you vomit your resource theory it do not matter how pro you be if luck just screw you on the other side i have to say that eternal have the good free to play scheme however like any other ccg whilst expansion start to hoard new player will have an increasingly difficult time to build a collection no matter how generous the game it be in the beginning if it do not scale with the increase card pool at some point you start draft the same card over and over so you end with little to none value even if they give it to you so as a final veredict i stop play eternal mainly because mana flood screw it become expensive in time to farm resource the return value be pathetic and balance can be tricky sometimes however i do not think it be bad at all if you be mtg fanboy you should give it a try otherwise run from here and try something else to avoid waste your time,neg
this game be one of the best free to play i have ever play its the kind of game that you can play for hour and still not learn everything there be i have play 26 hour at the time of this review and still have not use the autopilot weapon system and much more everytime i play this i seem to learn something i do not know before it do take a while to get a hang of and i would not recommend it to anybody who give up easily because you do need to crash a lot in order to get a hang of everything it be a game that seem to reward those who put in the time to learn how to fly specific plane because it have a ton of keyboard binding some a necessity some a conveniance the plane you get in the free version do a good job at show two side of pilot the tf 51d be a plane that in the game require some learning in order to know how to just start it since it have an eight step proccess to start the engine once you get the tf 51d in the air it seem to be an easy plane to learn because it do not have a very high top speed and therefore have less you can mess up with in thing such as land the su 25 t be completely different because it make everything on the ground easy but once you be in the air you can break your wing off if you turn too sharp which i know from experience the community from what i have experience be very friendly and i do not hesitate to ask them question because they be helpful for the most part aside from the lctrl e e e joke every once in a while overall this game be great it be a game i would willingly buy which make it even better that it be free if you would like a game that can teach you something while you learn this would be a great game to try,pos

early access revieweternal be what happen if you mix hearthstone and magic the gathering it be more complex than hearthstone due to the fact that you can block attack unit with your own much like in magic the gathering also you do not just get mana every turn automatically but by playing may card which be kind of similar to land card in magic the gathering so beware becaus you may get landscrewed but do not let that discourage you to try this awesome free ccg due to its mechanic it be a hell of a lot deep than hearthstone while visually every bit as attractive there be a whole lot of singleplayer content in it which provide you with gold and card you can earn every card in the game without ever play against somebody online that be a huge plus in my opinion there be a single player mode call challenge in which you fight one ai opponent after another to unlock reward the more opponent you defeat without lose the great your reward and it be absolutely free and can repeatet as often as you like another singleplayer mode be gauntlet in which you draft your deck to play against ai opponent much like in the challenge mode the difference here be that you can actually keep your draft deck afterwards even if you lose against the first ai that to me be absolutely fantastic and something that always put me off in hearthstone arena mode where you have to choose between buy a pack or risk your hard earn gold in hope for more than just one pack that beee say it cost gold to enter gauntlet mode which be gather failry quick if you like d hearthstone or magic the gathering or any other digital ccg i strongly recommend try this one it have a huge collection of card and have the fair free to play model i have ever see in a digital ccg great job dev keep it up,pos

a great competitive game to have fun with friend or play competitive interesting game because you have alot of god of different mythology and some god have advantage on other because of their mythology and origin which be really interesting in a game compare to league of legends i think this game be way more fun to play i highly recommend it if you want a great competitive and a really fun game this 1 will entertain you alot explain the concept of god have advantage on other each god have his different habilitie and strenght his purpose in the game his role some god can be strong oppenent to other mean his mythology be great then another god example he bo be a god that control massive and turbulent water also there s poseidon the greek god that also have habilitie on water although do you know that poseidon may be a god on smite but in his real lore you can search it if you want ofc poseidon be consider a semi god and he bo be definetly strong than poseidon in the game due to his massive burst damage through out the game that s what i be try to explain although they may have certain advantage on other like i be try to say i mean bellona definetly have advantage on other due to her absorb and her abusive kit i think you all get the point now although despite minor advantage a few kill on a god can make it very op and abusive through out the game so its the concept of have minor advantage on other be through there habilite and kit in the game but like i say despite minor advantage in game each god can get a few kill and be a force to be deal with in game although its a minor concept about certain advantage with the god it all depend on your team composition against the other god it will depend on your build and how much you farm do not get greedy and think that pick god like he bo scylla you will automatically win against other god no that s not the point here it will all depend on how you perform in the game,pos

world of tank blitz be almost identical in mechanic to its pc and console counterpart but the texture have be scale down and the stat have be modify to create a much faster pace game simple 7 7 and match last up to 10 minute rather than 15 but i higly doubt you will need all 10 minute just a hint if you play the pc version and then play a few round in blitz the same way you dominate all competition only one thing that really make me mad be that they be start to create more and more disadvantage to the people who do not pay any money on the game personally i make a purchase on the pc version for the simple reason of there be no real disadvantage to not pay,pos

early access reviewedit it amaze me how so many people give negative review after a recent patch they do not like this game be early access and have multiple patch often while they try new thing why not stick with the game and have a little faith in the dev while they try new thing so after invenste some time into this game with a few of my friend i have decide to do a review when i first play i be hook i have play lot of royale game but this one be different and give you more control with the craft element the dev have show they do listen to the community and they be experiment it be alpha after all and while some of the change be a little frustrating its to be expect my only critisism be the amount of bug in the game that seem to take forever to fix the lag at the start of the game be at its bad ever the weapon be fun to use however i think the resent update have kinda kill some of them the class weapon be fun and different to play with however the assasin sniper capable of hit 2200 with a heashot which be usually a one shot be a little to easy to hit with and it just be not fun to play against overall my game experiance have be good and i look forward to see what the dev have in store for the future for a free game its definitly worth pick up and try it,pos
early access reviewlove this game for year recent update have make it unplayable what be the point of a game that tout the ideal of build creatively when you have to grind or literally gamble to build in the first place the epic loot update have make this game lose any chance of myself spend any more money let alone any more time on this crap i feel there be nothing leave to say my hundred of hour of playtime along with many other with as much if not more leave similar review tell the story enough,neg
do not get me wrong this be a great game but really i have to spend 10 dollar every 3 month just to be able to hunt every animal garbageif you do not mind spend that then get the game its really good but if you do not think that be worth it then do not get this game,neg
they put out new deck every month that counter previus meta so it force peple to buy new deck bcs you can t get free gem as fast as they can put new deck and if you don t have last deck you will probably get stompedand some of you may ask why then i have 600 hour in 2 monthsreason be very simple i get hooked in try to learn the game and beat it in f2p way and end up extremly dissapointed no matter how much card you get if it s not in top 3 deck and if your enemy isn t complete idiot you may win 1 in 10 game and 8 of those game will probably end after enemys 2 turn,neg
  update reviewfebruary 25 2015 well i decide to spend a little more time on raceroom racing experience and admittedly it be a lot well than when i try it last year i have be able to complete single player ai race on two track and i can practice on three track the selection of car be a little well for be free but still not enough to really keep you entertain i do not try the online portion of this partially because i be pretty bad at this game i be more use to forza and gt and partially because most people play online be use dlc that you need to purchase this game definitely have great physics and i will probably give it another shot use my g27 instead of my xbox 360 controller unfortunately i still can not recommend it you can pay for a full game like pcars or assetto corsa and receive a lot more content than raceroom can deliver in its dlc pack from what i be read old reviewmay 26 2014 during the small amount of time i have have play this i honestly do not think this be a free to play game admittedly this game feel and play more like a demo than f2p only be able to play hot lap mode with one track a few variant of that one track but still one location and very few car make this game feel like a joke when advertise as free to play while the gameplay be decent enough i feel that the control of the car could be a little well use a g27 i feel as if i can not seem to turn sharp enough to get through some corner unless i slow down to rediculously slow speed and that be only use 200 degree of the wheel as a comparison on assetto corsa i can pull decent turn during the curve and that be use the full 900 degree of the wheel unfortunately i can not recommend this for your simulation fix i think you would be well off currently purchase assetto corsa,neg
early access reviewso while i could not get the full enjoyment out of the game for my multiplayer experience i will start off by say this be a wonderfully design game by appearance the interface to create and learn recipe be great for single player experience loot and interact with the world be quite nice even the idea of server host world right out of the box be awesome but that lead to my major gripe and what ultimately lead to me cease to play the game with my friend random world reset usually via one player crash be the big annoyance i have after play for about a half an hour we would have establish a nice place storage and what not then at least one of us crash those that do come back to the world to see everything we build and remove from the world restore to how it be when we first find it they could fly through wall and the floor as if there be no clipping on them only because in their game the entire structure do not exist anymore if they be to extract the block in their way which be part of the structure in our version they would receive the material as they see it but we would see that craft item be pick up and effectively delete due to them get dirt instead to alleviate this those that could see pack up the base and move to a new location till the issue repeat you can only be willing to rebuild redesign a structure so many time before you just give up ultimately i assume this issue come from world datum be save on the user pc and not coincide refresh base on the severs datum at least a debug tool which force a refresh of currently load cell chunk to be download from the server would be useful until this issue be fix but until that time i will await for update and play other game once again the game be amazing at what it have so far but that issue be killer for anyone hope for a solid multiplayer experience,pos
i reccomend this game heavily even though some overlay bug happen on my main pc it be addictive and the permadeath mechanic will get you to constantly create new character and try new thing,pos
early access reviewpretty unique solid game mechanic i agree with other reviewer comment on this its like a spaceship moba i particuarly enjoy the art direction on the ship as well as the lumber manueverability during gameplay it really give you a sense of the massiveness of the boat lastly i hope they keep skin as the only thing that cost money to avoid ptw also particularly interesting be how the class be essentially divide base on ship size manueverability and specific cd what set this apart be the 3 dimensional aspect of each engagement give that its still in alpha i will give them the benefit of the doubt on the following 1 optimization2 lag spike in game3 connectivity issue into matches4 no complete texture on most stationary object what i would like to see more of personally be as follow 1 large team 5v5 seem too small 10v10 sound awesome with big map 2 a slighter further zoom on the ship3 well effect on cqc type weapons4 more game modes5 more non interactive background battle in some of these map for immersion 6 more customization on loadout think mechwarrior online 7 a grand conflict to engage community to work towards something other than just a grind 8 it be awesome if eve be like this will buy again for sure,pos
it be all about how you see iti have play this game for a long time since it start and tell you that it be pretty fun until you reach lvl 60 thing change and you have the urge to pay real money for real equipment but the storyline of the game be amazing the boss be also good and the dungeon be fantastic not to forget you can make your own map that you can post it and have other donate for your work with asteral diamond which be a currency you can either buy or get overall8 10 give it a try and you judge d it be free for a while xd,pos
special funny lucky friendly exciting heart pump smart cheeky and memorable moment with amazing people in a game with so much distinctive character in it put a smile on your and make it incomparable than the rest because of its special thing from its tiny map prop to the class to the comic_strip and even to the update not dead legend do not die,pos
i have always love this game i love the idea of own my own home be it an inn or prestige and be able to decorate it lot of endless possibility i love do the quest craft raid the most unique part of this mmo compare to other the guide they be there to chat listen to your concern and they take time out of their day to also run quest a game i will continue to play,pos
this game be pretty good it be basically all those popular voxel game put together to make a good game overview so when you first launch up the game you make your account which be pretty easy so i do not mind that and then you make your character the character creation be nice with a couple hair style and lot of color to choose for anything really so after create your character you get put into your own world this be basically the tutorial section of the game this little cube name qb be basically your navi h e y l i s t e n they will help you along in all your adventure after you get through the tutorial section of the game you can start do stuff by your own there be not really an end to the game unless you count the end as collect all item which be yeah you know the gameplay be really fun too the combat feel balanced and the building be pretty polished for the time it be be out this game be really fun especially if you have friend who play too you can make world together and stuff tl dr creativerse be a voxel game which be very polished and really fun,pos
i will keep update my review since i be discover something new i like every day i have never feel so excited play a simulator or a videogame thank to facetrack noir i can move my head in the game just by use a webcam and explore every aspect of the su 25 cockpit the level of detail be absurd the difficulty be as hard as expect but so damn rewarding i manage to complete the take off landing and i be almost do with the artillery tutorial and it really feel like something,pos
for some reason first level you be match with low level player and there be no vehicle it be pure soldier fight then you reach level 5 or something like that and suddently there be vehicle everywhere you be match with very high player and the game suddendly become really uninteresting and annoying i remember my first game with vehicle no one have weapon to kill say vehicle in my team for simple reason that we be all too low level to have unlock the weapon require to fight against vehicle so we spend the game try to avoid the unkillable armored vehicle of enemy team do not even need to mention that we lose because their armored vehicle be camp our spawn the second game i join i spawn start to run for 10 sec and suddently a plane dive on me and kill me spawn again another plane dive on me and kill me plane camp our spawn the third game there be no third game with vehicle i uninstalle i have fun til i reach the require level to have vehicle in my game which mean approximatively 10 15 game without vehicle then it be just a spawn camp bore fest the decent item weapon you have to pay for them this game be exactly what you can expect from greedy developer i hate to say it but i try battlefield 1 even if i promise myself to never ever play this franchise because the last good bf game be bf2 and all game after it be just money grab pile of poop well you want a good war game battlefield 1 be way well than previous bf game and honestly the balance between weapon and vehicle be really good i never feel overwhelmed by vehicle yes they be annoying but not unstoppable if you want to invest few buck get bf1 and have some fun worth your money avoid hero and general at all cost you will just waste your money into it the only thing that be interesting in h g be the general part of the game which be not open to new player the good player be general and they can take decision on europe map to decide where they be send their soldier goal of each side be to conquer all europe and then ordinary soldier will fight for objective decide by their general every win be a territory capture on the map it be really interesting idea honestly a part of the game be a kind of rts and the other be fps but yeah again the greedy dev be make this game absolutely awful and unbalanced to play sadly too bad for them go get bf1,neg
early access reviewi be not a huge fan of the battle royale genre however i can safely say this be the exception for me i start play the weekend close alpha start and i can see how much this game have grow since then as it be now it be honestly a fun game to play i be sure once it reach beta or when it be fully release it will be so much well,pos
very good game a big learing curve but after you get the basic down it be so much fun you also have the option to play so many diffrent god so the game allways fell new to me even though i have 108 hour the last part be the toxic pepole who play this game you run into them every like 4 5 game but you can just mute them,pos
pro you can be tanker to blow infantry with tank you can be infantry to blow tank with anti tank mine and airplane with anti air gun you can be pilot to blow theout with plane you can be parathroper to capture enemy camp you can be sniper to blow infantry head if you be accurate enough to aim camo or skin in this game really help you to blend with the environtment you need play this game with headset it will help you to hear enemy footstep and you can set ambush for them the dev add update for grind system and make more easy for newbie to get credit con repetitive gameplay all you do be just capture enemy camp with time limit many people say this game pay to win but for me be pay to progress this game all about grind so i do not recommend people to play it if not patient enough to grind credit for buy weapon tank vehicle at least every month you need buy veteran membership to help earn credit and earn exp rank faster like monthly subcription but you can play without it too but it will take you long enough to earn credit and reach the high rank,pos
early access reviewthis game be suprisingly good the main advantage of this game compare to fortnite be there be no f king build its all about your shooting skill it be sooo satisfying when you can just shoot someone without expect them to build a damn tower in 0 0001 second skill and class give more depth to this game make it good enough to leave behind fortnite or pubg if you be unsatisfied with them for any reason i 100 recommend this game,pos
the idea be great the game be ok sadly it be full of hacker tweaker mouse macros etc just google youtube for h g macro and since it be basically a free game lot of kid do not mind use those hack their nickname be well known to the community but they do not seem to ever get ban maybe because there be no work anticheat and the ingame report function do not seem to do anything can not recommend you be really waste your time and possibly your money here better look for something else,neg
i love this game i have already spend countless hour on it and still have not get tired of it it be f2p with an option to buy special item in game but unlike most f2p game it be not pay to win update be always regular since they happen every 2 week if you play this game the good thing i can recommend be to make lot of friend while it be fun play alone the experience you get from play with friend be much well give it it try it be free so what do you have to lose,pos
early access reviewthis game be amazing to say it be only in alpha definite must buy for anyone who like game like sto star conflict or elite dangerous also it be a great price at only a7,pos
  note i have play about 14000 game of blitz and 5000 game of pc wot so my steam hour be by far not everything this game be just like real life it require a lot of skill but be mostly base on luck the grinding possibility be almost endless also you will never have to go to the shop to buy salt again bring to you by wargayme to be serious though it be a fun game but there be a lot of annoying aspect to it would get 6 10 from me,pos
early access reviewfrom hero to zero when the game come out it be really good but as now after all the bad patch they fu ed up whole game its really sad but we can not do anything about it i have fun but everything have to end one day,neg
early access reviewgame be very hard to get a group in let alone grind to max would be unbearable as its just a quest grind or single mob elite mob farm unless you want to treat it like a job also pvp be very small ever since the release of siege i do not think they ever even once have one map with the maximum amount of player for the 50 v 50 because the game population fall so rapidly due to inbalenced combat and they only have two server so let that s speak to for its active player most the veteran still play be likely people who benifitte from these early bug and nerf also guild be kinda pointless do not really care about you if their 5 man group have fill limit on dungeon per day make this a clique game if i ever see one oh and pvp be restrict to certain time of day so you may as well find another game to play honestly unless you would like to base your life by this game schedule and even more sadly their pay people to play their game openly luuul,neg
  give it a try this game be kinda fun at a basic level and if you like minecraft mmorpg game then this game be worth a try i will not say much about this game as i honestly do not like it that much but that be say i can not say it be a bad game just because i do not like it it be a pretty good game and you should give it a try it be just not my cup of tea,pos
very good diablo clone have an amazing hack and slash feel to it skill system gem and passive be both very good currency system be a little odd but overall i think its a good thing have a gritty dark theme to it,pos
buggy driving physic not in matter that game get bug it be medium tank be drive like a buggy car slide careen and do police turn thtas not only on concrete surface where it could be understandable but even on soft ground and under water sudden death syndrome a 12 mm machine gun can kill tiger by random hit that kill entire crew not really fun for anyone who be not into camping tacticslarge bias in performance of armor toward russian tank strange that soft german target flak new tds as well as russian aa gun that mean to have paper armor can surwive literally dozen penetrate hit and bounce some preium content do not worth it premium account do nothing but add silver income which can be obtain in large amount without that premium tank be not worth 45 cost aexcept couple of russians convert convertable research point highly contraproductive,neg
i like it but it be a bit slow while wait for everything to happen the main way to speed thing up be to buy from the shop with real money well that make sense right so i never spend any money and i grow tired of it and uninstalle it just do not grab me enough to spend any money on it it be good just not for me how can you rate a free thumb down,pos
early access reviewfantastic game feel a lot different to any other batte royale i have play with the class system forging be a nice unique feature that add to the fun and tension of the game as they basically act as hotspot on the map definitely worth give a shot,pos
i love this game even i do not play any fallout before since i play this game in mobile i love all about fallout but my pc not enought strong to play that lol sad and fallout shelter playable in pc i play it when i be rest of my another game dota i always wish to have game fallout4 for free maybe i will upgrade my pc in last year hahai hope this game can link in mobile in steam background,pos
early access reviewrobocraft be a constantly change game be starmade and world of tank feel like they have a child pro you get to build your own vehicle make your immagination important to gameplay game feel unique and unlike other run requirment be low any design choice can have benifit and drawback weapon all feel different many way to move your design be offer map feel a bit unique no pay to win issue frequent updatescon armour block heavy design tend to die faster than what you would think outdated smgs have be nerfe to the point be they do not feel like they can do there old job now outdated as of 30 06 2016 some of the game mode feel rather unbalanced medic determine the out come of match a little too heavily outdated game balance seam to change faster than you can adapt your design at time premium account need inorder to make rapid progress require comitment to feel fun do to frequent game changessummary this be a good game do not get me wrong its just that there seam to often be a lack of sustaned game balance one day something be add and seam to make design invulnerable and the very next day the opposite be true there be often no middle ground all that say i still like this game the unique and original feel help here overal this game deserve a 8 5 10 edit i would like to add here an additional final thought while a lot of community back lash have occur as of late i still have faith in the developer for the most part have be play since the day when this game have repair cost pay to win issue where much more prevelent back then i feel i know what i be talk about i do however believe that the loot crate system while nice do need a few touch up,pos
this be a great game even the comment be fun to read especially linkno1s personally and this be probably just me i think everyone should learn about gun that way they would not be such p ssie when it come to own and handle one this game be a great first step in learn about gun practice of coarse be a whole different story my wife and i both enjoy this game because it be like a puzzle game combine with the game of memory combine with thing that can kill and maim what be not to like and for the record my wife do not want gun in the house until i take her to the shooting range now she think she be rambo it be quite sexy now if i can just get her to wear a bikini when we go the only down side be that when we argue she swear she be go to go tarantino on myquot i usually have to remind her that he often use mexican stand off in his film which mean that she would not make it out alive either her response be i do not care i do not bring you in this world but i will take you out she be so cute anyway if you want a chance at survival in dangerous situation this game be a good starting point in learn about the tool you will need minus the tank and rocket launcher unless that be your thing i be not one to judge if you want to be a scared victim learn how to use the phone to call the cop and die wait for them although i do not think there be a game for that mainly because gun be cool and everyone love shoot thing and blow thing up but i digress if there be a game like that it be probably british author note before anyone get upset at me for my last comment i just want to point out that shoot a home invader in the face with a gun be a whole lot quicker than beat him her about the head and shoulder with a cricket bat although ye ole willow wood have less move part also keep in mind that criminal do not care about gun law come to think of it they may not care about cricket rule either i do not know maybe try this game bundle with don bradman cricket 14 or counter strike global offensive bundle with cricket revolution regardless i recommend this game,pos
tl dr if you enjoy give up your whole life to play a video game that be unbalanced as all heck then sure play it prepare to whip out your wallet and just give it to them otherwise well i put in enough time on this game to grace it with a review first i would like to point out that despite it come out a couple year after world of tank plane ship it still seem to mess up the one thing that mobas yes it be a moba last time i check u could not fly drive from russian to paris or w e tend to be good at and that be team balance in term of game play i mean you either know what to do or you do not simple as that no team cover for you when you want to assault a point no team provide fire support for you when you defend it be basically a bunch of people run around shoot at thing people i say thing because there be pve although i would wager that some of the ai in this game be cheat they know exactly where you be at all time know exactly where to shoot at all time never miss due to rng and will always score kill on you when they hit it be a shame that such thought go into the rpg aspect of this game at least more so than world of x as you can already tell i have play both gaigin and wg game i like tank like ship more although steel ocean be well at it than these two cash grab company all that aside do not kid yourself this game be just a big long con cash grab the company i would imagine see just how great and excited aka dumb and gullible us gamer be to see that we can progress the rank and fight with well tank if we just spend a little a metric ton to be more clear gold in the game gold eagles be the cash only currency do not get me wrong i know there be not any such thing as free to progress free to play meh ok but most people get bored of play a couple hour a day just to see you progress down your rank tier couple 100 xp per battle for a win and you will lose often when you need something like 50k xp to unlock a semi decent vehicle it be sad that they show picture of naval combat on their store page when they have not even come close to be do with it just a another sad marketing ploy by a sad and full of crap company,neg
drive well feel good have lot of fun with the hill climb many little detail that i could appreciate much love however dodge a bunch of handicapped people who manage to flip their car every qualifying session t1 make you swerve and get your lap invalidate get very tiring after not even a day i start off with a pad then upgrade and it feel great with a wheel but there be so many bad driver around i have uninstalle the whole thing which bring me to another point 35 gb for only a few car and track you can actually use in race you will just get ram off and you can just sit through 25 minute of practice and qualify again afterwards no matter where you start you will get hit good game bad player and bad measure against them i have encounter some very sportsmanlike people as well both in victory and defeat in term of yield or just cleanly pass you with superior pace i suppose the f2p model cut both way you can give it a try but it attract not so serious player that will ruin your experience get the other car and track to escape the f2p camp be probably more pricey in the end than get a full game so this be a no for me in the end,neg
early access reviewthis be ahum be actually a brilljant game love it when it come out some patch later they screw it all up and make some kind offps out of it build stuff be stil fun but you can just respawn if you get bust keep classic mode on the side be not work imho,neg
i 3 thiswhen i find this game i decide to give it a try now this be one of my favourite game you may think i be over react but i love gun so there overall great time waster everyone should have in their steam library,pos
early access reviewfracture space be in early access and the game be already great i can not wait for what will come in the future of its development the game consist of space battle and the ship you use be not those agile space fighter you see in other game and in movie they be large slow and can not turn on a dime and honestly that be refreshing to see and awesome to play as it make you have to commit to you action because you can not just bail from a fight if it turn sour you have the ability to warp back to base however this take time to boot up and drasticly reduce your defense so unless you start the jump before they turn their attention to you you be most likely dead also some ship can jump short distance but that do not mean that they escape your weapon range and some ship can disable ability the game also have moba esq quality you have to capture the enemy base to win you have to push up side lane in order to access say base after a set amount of time a zone open up that if capture provide a buff to the team that capture it ship be classify as dps tank and support you could call the game a moba but it do not feel like a moba so if you have a thign against mobas do not write this game off i highly reccommend this game,pos
alot of people who review this do so in the sense of do i enjoy the game rather than look at my enjoyment i be go to analyze the mechanicsissue with the mechanicstoo many hit to kill a tank everything could be black except for one crewman and the enemy tank will still keep kick one shot kill one guy die appearntly i detonate for some reason horrid balance for low tier flak panzers rule begineer matchs and do not teach player important thing for later tier no motivation to keep play the grind be way too real for this i want a new game not a world of tank rip off with even bad balance motivation to use the pay for currency the game shower you in convertible xp which need the pay to get currency match be easy to get up tiered into a flak panzer against a m3 lee excuse me what good thing about the mechanicshitting a plane feel satisifying but why do plane have to be make of steel when i fight them but when i be one i be appearntly make of tin foilnull pointsgood soundsgood tanksgood airpaneslack of boatsupgrade usually result in you get uptiered against your will overall an average game overshadow by game maker who be work with some hefty bias and not include the full picture of tank on tank combat where be my t 34 break down because of their shoddy mass production so 5 5 10 for me too much pay too win and not enough motivation for me to keep it go,neg
early access reviewit be not the most scary game out there but it be effective and interesting the game start to convince you to feel that it be a joke and be not suppose to be actually scary then something silly catch you off guard and startle you you laugh it off embarressed then there come spookys specimen which be startling and not cute which the you may not expect the game add more depth with a few reference and room with silly morbid mini game which emphasize how much you should actually fear spooky spooky be a very adorable character too i love her design and how she too seem like a joke at first but then you start to realize she be pretty evil and crazy i have a playtime of only about 10 minute because i be have trouble get the new build to display properly i have play this a while ago before it be steam release,pos

early access reviewso where to begin this game be good and have some good concept and design the graphic be very visually pleasing and the game run smooth minus some rendering issue now and then there be a good baseline of item that can be use however apart from the block all the item can be aquire fairly quickly i have play this game for about 15 hour in total and pretty much have every item minus all block colour and combination which really be not long time get to end game item as this game will be closely compare to minecraft for obvious reason although the content be lack in creativerse in time they would be able to compete with them such as a redstone equivalent the big problem with this game be the fact that block can take forever to create use forging rather than craft as this game have some very visually pleasure content for structure this should be address so people can come into the game and just create something like a creative mode would suit this game very well overall the way the game stand i would give this game a 6 5 10 and would recommend it to someone who would like a change from minecraft,pos
a fluid and competent adaptation from the mobile platform the graphic be much nice than the mobile platform although there be some mistake windowed tab for example it pass as a average grind game,pos

  dcs have to be one of the good all round combat flight simulator cover aircraft from ww2 all the way up to near current day airccaft soon to have more aircraft and scenery module add to the already grow number of study aircraft this be far from an arcade simulation it take time and effort on user part to even gain a basic level of competence if you have a good basic knowledge of flight and want to improve it further this be as great of a starting point that there be on steam skill in air combat be not need to enjoy this simulation there be many pilot that fly strictly formation aerobatic freeflight situation on multyplayer server i have great fun with friend and other i have meet while fly this sim online competion be out there on multyplayer if you want to be an ace the option be in the sim to go that route just be forewarn that there be no such thing as ace in a day with this simulator i be lucky to get 1 kill per session and there be be many a day that the total be zero but i still have a great time while engage in dcs world i suggest that you try this on steam as it be free to play with 2 free aircraft include once you have decide to purchace module it may be good to purchace directly frrom eagle dynamic as new module buy in steam will not transfer over to stand alone dcs world instal from eagle dynamic new module take long to get from stand alone version into steam release as well there be more sale on at eagle dynamics web store than steam have there be a lot to thiis sim as far as content go and the future look very bright for the next new module that be come down the pipe any way you cut it this be a great simulator and a ton of fun cya in the sky chybear,pos
early access reviewtldr one of the good card game out there not recommend due to flawed apparently unfixable core mana power mechanic comparison to mtg and hearthstone barely do it justice while it draw inspiration from the two the varied mechanic make every faction color fight on equal footing from aggro to midrange or even late game mammoth deck they all clash for a piece of the pie well the same be valid for every card game what make this one special the sheer feel of power your card give compare to any other ccg the strength of these card be absurd the feed back you get from your deck when you win be that you stomp the opponent even if the game be close while lose have the reverse effect the game do not let you dwell on the past reward be give with every occasion single player campaign ai game first win of the day and so on you will have to keep your aspiration to a top tier place in check tough get a decent collection still require investment time and or money as in every ccg other player have say more positive about the game than i could write in a limited space as such i will focus on why i give it a negative mark like mtg it suffer from power fixing issue you either get too much or too little mana power flood or screw they mend the algorithm several time and yet it be far from work i will not quote other player or streamer suffice to say the issue be real the amount of game lose due to mana power issue be enough to make the grind tiring and unpleasant as strange as it sound its even sad when the opponent have it add these loss up you end up with a simple question why be not there anything be do well there be maybe the communication regard the issue be minimal for me the big question be why they choose the classical mtg style of mana power fixing know the flaw it have more so consider some of the main developer be former mtg player the game be beautiful fun mechanic captivating game great feed back and reward but all of it be diminish to a zero line by its flawed core mechanic mana power fix a flaw i do not believe will ever be fix prove me wrong,neg
elsword feature skill base action gameplay combine with role play element and community feature typical of an mmorpg such as guild chat and item trade i be very addicted to the game i personally love it i always like these type of game since it have that manga anime feel to it their be about 6 character at the moment 8 29 15 and i have a lot of stuff to talk about this game so let us get start the story seem to be lead a good way of what be happen there be always a good amount of sub quest story quest to enjoy the one thing i love be that different character have a unique skill style class path ect the voice acting be pretty nice i do not mind too much from it since it be voice in japanese the stage environment be a 8 7 10 since it be not really perfect in my opinion but it be nice there be some main story quest that have a cinematic cutscene after you complete it very nice to the story overall different gameplay mechanic item equipment feature and other great thing that make this game alive but then there be one problem to elsword the pvp matchup seem to be alright but bad at the same time because due to have to vs lvl 70 that will 1 shot you but most of my time on pvp it be do not occur too much then it use to i know people be say this be a pay2win type of game it be be one of those typical game but keep it clean and have fun with your friend if your friend play it overall i must rate this game a total of 9 10 remember everyone will have their own opinion have a wonderful day elsword main page wiki page,pos

early access reviewthe fps in this game be so awful that i can not go into any town area as that make it so bad that it be as good as have your game freeze additionally when the game developer decide every class be do too much damage they nerfe each class by 80 and no that be not an exaggeration naturally this make it near impossible to finish any story quest with more than one enemy not to mention any dungeon i may be able to put up with that but the fps be the bad which they will not even aknowledge despite hundred of player scream about it on twitter etc do not buy this game until after they have fix such issue after that it may be worth it,neg
if you care about story and the choice you make i would not suggest this game while the story be neat and they be sell more it come at an odd price that feel like no one think it through when you make choice in the story each one of the two give you a specific card and as it be a card game where the idea be to make a deck you enjoy i find it odd that the card i want always go against the choice i want to make i could ge the well card to work with my deck or choose the story option i want but never both the game itself be neat but the story be what i be follow and i be unable to keep go with this issue,neg
trove be a great game for people that like the block type game apparently it have lose popularity and be die this make me very sad really trion do a great job here but too many people just run back to minecraft or pixark etc love the game overall for myself this game be much well with a controller,pos
early access reviewat the time of this review i would like to let other know that the game be very unrefined for that reason alone i do not recommend it for purchase give this particular game past failure one would expect additional effort from the developer into make sure this release would be a successful one sadly that have not be the case as many of the current issue should have never get past quality control one must wonder why the developer release the game in its current state know full well how the western audience would receive it i be struggle to keep myself from jump on the cash grab hate bandwagon i can not seem to find many justifiable reason for the action the neowiz team have take i honestly want this game to succeed but the developer be not do themselves any favor,neg
as a simracing beginner i have to say that i like this title the feeling of the car be very good and the sound be just awesome i can not describe how good and realistic it be the apex hunt feature have help me as a beginner to reduce my lap time and learn the track and break point ok there be some negative point aswell such as miss night day feature weather and multiplayer another negative point be that if you want all of the content such as track car and livery you better start save up some money because it be very expensive the overall image be good i think but not perfect it be a develop product so it be improve with every update and the fact that it be more or less free to play you can drive 2 car on one track and participate in challenge should encourage everyone to at least try it out i would highly suggest it for those who be simrace beginner or for those who want to see if they like simracing or not,pos
fallout shelter great fun game nice time waster really enjoyable never really play these type of game but shelter do good what it do you be the overseer that control everything in the vault really fun train all your dweller for special stat equip all that gear send them out into the wasteland or on quest which be fun to do but can take a while if you do not have or be low on quantum some quest reward them so if you have no problem wait you will get some more some also reward lunchboxe no need to buy them but if you want more fast loot buy away same with craft it take time can speed it up a little by equip dweller with certain gear for stat on whatever you be craft or can be complete straight away with quantum it be good save them up get more dweller be good the old fashioned way the radio studio be pretty bad in my case rarely have i get dweller from the outside and also apperantely attract deathclaw or enemy in general more often to attack not sure combat be a little too fast pace at least in a big vault with a lot of dweller quest be fine if they start lose health too fast which happen pretty often you get to heal them all fast one by one and sometimes a few can die with the clunky clicking around especially when one attack happen soon after another and you have not recover the common attack especially deathclaw and accident can get pretty annoying but it be managable good to expand slowly i like the way cappy and bottle visit pretty often play track from nuka world and raise that happines cool also pet pet be cute seem like legendary dweller be really rare also none from fallout new vegas which be a shame it be no big deal really but include some would be fun and great mysterious stranger the badass appear pretty often who give cap random amount sometimes can be a pain to find on time but still fun maybe an elder scroll game like fallout shelter would be fun who know overall very fun game definitely recommend,pos

early access reviewthe gameplay be fun the weapon feel good however that be the end of the good the progression now be completely luck base mean one person who put 50 hour in could possibly have well gear than someone who put 500 hour in that my friend be bull on top of that the dev have be scummy a friend of mine be silence can not use chat because they complain about the luck base progression they get offend and decide to silence say friend for profanity reason i do not reccomend this game especially after all of the progression change as update go by and the sensitive dev who can not take criticism do not bother with the game there be a lot well game out there to play than this one,neg
dota 2 be a 5 v 5 moba game you have a selection out of 108 unique hero each with a unique skillset every hero be also available from the minute you start no playing x amount of game before this hero become available the object of dota 2 be to destroy the other team ancient to do this you can work your way down any of the 3 lane top mid or bottom by destroy the outer tower you will start most match pair up or go into a lane solo try to get some experience and gold by last hit creeps as the game progress you will start team up more with your other team member to take on the other team or to quickly kill of a solo member of their team because of the importance of coordinate your attack with other team member communication be a very important aspect of the game i therefor also recommend play this game with some friend because random people that you will be team up with will not always show the same willingness to communicate if you be just start out play dota 2 i also recommend play with a friend who already have some experience in the game because the learning curve be very steep especially when you have to figure everything out by yourself the skill ceiling be also extremely high so every time you play you may learn something new due to the high number of available hero skill and item you can be sure that every game be unique something to be wary of be the community there be people out there that take this game way more seriously than you may most player have an opinion of what you should have do in a certain situation and will be happy to blame a lost teamfight on you not take that action flaming be something that could happen often but if you be play with a team entirely make up of your friend this should not prove to be an issue if this be not the case do not worry you can always mute the player that be cause you grief and continue enjoy this wonderful team orient game,pos

such a great moba even if you do not like traditional mobas you should try smite if you like game like world of warcraft then you really should like smite because the 3rd person view make it a quite similar experience hi rez interact a lot with the community which be awesome and in smite you can get all current and future god character for only 25 which if you for example look at league of legends 25 be an amazing even impossible deal i highly recommend this game and do not let my hour confuse you i have play 700h before the steam version come out,pos

this use to be my one of my topthree game hand down but the game stop be fun becauseinstead of a militaray aircraft and armor simulator it be become a economic simulator the ingame economy be break prevent youform play if close to top tier vehicle without pump in boatload of realworld currency and in addition to this instead of atttempte to alleviate the gameplay or in game economy issue the developer simply continue to nerf reward and add high and high tier vehicle which be not even feasible to obtain or maintain in game,neg
game use to be fun but have turn into an endless grind with a heavy focus on microtransaction to speed it up also the game have literally no attempt at balance or realism with 20 mm machinegun out damage 100 mm shell in the naval battle and some ship be stick at 10 mph while everyone else be at 40 meaning you never even see an opponent half the time,neg
path of exile or poe be one of my favorite arpg at the moment it have a massive i mean massive passive skill tree i would call it more like a forest and gameplay be fun and intuitive i would recommend this game to anyone that like torchlight series or grim dawn or even diablo iii which be get well by the day i just can not say enough positive thing about poe there be update to the game all the time and the game itself be totally free you just can not beat that thumb up for sure,pos

early access reviewit be so close to be great but it be not i recently pick up eternal because i have be frustrate with the currently break shadowverse meta and lack of interest in hearthstone i could tell right off the bat in the tutorial mission that mana would be a huge frustration and i be right there be a reason the most popular card game on the planet do not use mana card mana card suck they suck alot game after game you will either be beg to draw more mana or beg to stop draw so much mana you will be frustrate almost every single game and it marrs the entire experience the card be awesome and the game have a fantastic overall design and it be almost utterly ruin by mana card it be an outdated and terrible mechanic if they switch to a resource generation system the game would be a thousand time better as it stand i can not in good conscious recommend this game to anyone,neg

i be a wwii nerd so obvs i like this game esp the wwii era of the tank you can some what learn some history if you do your research etc etc on the tank the way it be make the reason why it be make etc anyway personally blitz be much well vs world of tank the normal one or whatever tf you wanna call it blitz be a much fast pace with less player on each side and a much small map along with that there s no artys aka artillery which be bless bc artillery be annoying play this game over the year on both the pc and mobile version not too big of a difference of movement i guess that s the term idk anyway cross platform of both pc and mobile version no big difference whatever your well at control either hold a tablet or ipad or just keyboard personally keyboard a bit annoying simply bc sometimes harder to move left hand away from wasd while try to shoot the enemy tank while try to dodge so you kinda panic ish but whatever just depend your play style no big issue with the game lot of update frequently not very bad from time to time there be event or speical mission pretty cool tbh currently most annoying thing have to be afk ppl some i will say be afk other be not an afk issue simply bc sometimes not often but maybe every so month you start a game you load and do not load in until maybe 30 to 40 second after the game have start pretty annoying second most annoying thing be when ppl say oh your a pay to win buddy stfu honestly you literally have a tank that cost money too even than what s bad be they run into open die within the 1 min of when the game start than blame on the team say y all camp personally i think once you start out play this game be kinda meh or boring etc feel grindy bc you need to get certain amount of xp to research something new than go to next tier etc etc tier 8 in my opinon have the most action all type of skill level you have player that be new if they buy a tier 8 premuim tank not really pay to win bc each and every tank have a advantage disadvantage against any other tank along with that it depend on how you play and how your team be for example some player with heavy tank powerful gun strong armor but slow speed some player will literally sit in the back of the map not say you can not but you really can not win the round if your go to sit in the back and let your light tank medium tank or tank destroyer die now not all be like that some be very skilled they be able to read on what they should do should not do against another tank other sigh they yolo it as in push 4 tank and die right in the open while shoot once and probably never hit anyone or pen against them obvsly you start off with low tier tank when you start the game but there s a reason to teach you oh how the game will be etc you have many nation that you can pick usa ussr french german china japan or british tank each one of those have there own special perk or skill for example german tank very heavy armor with strong armor same with the soviet tank the french however be less armored but they have a mag shell or autoloader as in they reload maybe 17 20 second depend what tank but they have the ability to move fast pace and shoot total of 3 shell in less than 5 second as in let say the amx 50 100 you have 4 shell total in a mag it take 17 idk something around that second but you can shoot 4 shell you shoot once than it take 3 3 second to reload the next one and so on until you shoot all 4 than it reload again with the full 17 second very overpower in its own way if you have the timing but can be annoy bad in time as in close combat or 1 v 2 just depend now the british tank very good but they have one of the most if not most of all the tank fire less than 7 to 9 second which as you get to high tier it get annoying and you would want to take the british tank out first simply bc their go to keep nail you before you can even reload the next shot however some tank like the americans and japanese tank you will not really see much of japense tank simply bc they kinda suck however for american tank you will not really see any tier 6 or 7 tank i hardly ever see any simply bc every tank for any of the nation beat it cough cough fix t20 bc its useless but lead to the m48 patton which be very good not only that look good too other than those tank you will see a few tank which do not look wwii era or stupid tank however its nice to see different tank instead of go against the same old tank overall for customization do not look bad very different from the other world of tank less thing to add but here the camo do not look as bad they help you in the game along with that i really look forward when they can create attachment for each tank like is3 is6 all the attachment look sick the american eagle look great on some of the american tank but position very odd kinda suck that all tier 10 tank have their own legendary skin and attachment if wargaming can make it so the customization be same for both platform on blitz and the normal orginal one it would be bless something to note about this game there be rank however not many ppl play it or atleast it take awhile for me to get into a rank game there s 2 modes team deathmatch and supremacy mode capture the flag there s 3 or 4 depend on the map first to 1k point or to knock out the other tank win graphic be not too bad look the same from my eye on pc to mobile sadly on pc version you only get to 60 fps max bit annoying at time when fps drop but whatever another thing you will not be place in a match in different region never have that happen never really have bad ping unless you play mobile without wifi aka not at home or idfk aslong as you play with wifi do you have good connection replay be nice you can sometimes learn from mistake on what you do etc etc by rewatche the match that you play ps it be not a pay to win game i have not pay a single dollar to get from a tank to another tank in a tech tree i only pay for the tank that i really want aka let say the scorpion be a new tank that come out a couple of day i have a dollar xd be so stupid litterally just click and bam get it with 1 ppl get salty bc you get it and they could not but whatever anyway as i be say only time you would pay be for get more garage slot if you really want to keep every tank that you have get ps you would not really keep every tank there s no point just some tank you play you will hate and once you get enough xp for the other you instantly sell it xd it just take time to get enough xp for the next tank not only that you need enough credit to buy it and have enough to resupply ammo camo gear etc many factor go in it also why people buy premium tank be bc it give good credit so that way you can grind faster but you do not have to buy it you have a 1 chance from a crate idk off top of my head but free crate every so day week so you have a chance,pos
it take 20 minute to load multiplayer and there s a 75 chance it will crash i have not play before 2 5 but i hear it be preformance be much well than now i have an i5 760 but it should still be able to load the game fix the preformance then it be a 7 10 the flight realisim and immersion be just what i want when get a pc move from a xbox 360 as a kid the community like 104th mavrick and many niche other youtuber streamer be great but the module be too overpriced and the game can not be play without them i would personaly rather buy the game at a 30 40 dollar price tag and progressivly unlock the plane somehow maybe that s just me,neg

early access reviewfor a free to play fps it be not terrible and it do hold up to its promise of not be p2w pay to win yes there be some thing in the game that be clunky like the shotgun be super powerful sniper rifle be use on very small map make them one shot kill if you be quick to react and sometimes it feel even though you be aim at a guy your bullet hit the wall but even after all of that you will have fun the whole bullet hit the wall thing be true and aiming help only a little bit but it be not terribly game break to the point of rage you even get a special load out in a game mode that let you be a support assault or two other class that give you benefit like drone strike and helicopter support need polish but it be free to play and it be not half bad,pos
early access reviewif you do not watch the video that go along with the picture then you probably do not know this game mess with you and get really dark and creepy it be hard to decide if i should reccommend this game because its really creepy for a game call spookys house of jump scare,pos

early access reviewone of the bes thing about this game be the free stuff you get your first win of the day give you a booster pack the short campaign give you 5 starter deck and you get some more free deck every week the game be very generous in give booster for example instead of buy booster for 1000 gold you can pay 2500 gold to play the game mode call the forge where you draft 25 card and can win up to 4 additional booster it play similar to like magic the gathering while only visually look like hearthstone you can get all the card without pay any money but it will be a huge grind anyway eternal be more mechanic friendly compare to hex but both be fun and different game if anything i would say eternal be more casual eternal still have a lot of advanced mechanic that you can find in mtg though the main advantage eternal have over hex that attract me to this game be that this game be available on mobile platform,pos
pretty decent game for a ftp model people may say its p2w sure but nearly all card game be to begin with anyway even build real life meta deck cost you 100s of dollar to make overall though this game have some pretty nice graphic consider it be a mobile port gameplay be more simple than the other yugioh title because the maximum number of card be 30 and minimum be 20 in a deck i quite like this feature because it allow you to consistently get the draw you need to win your game this game may favor p2w player but ftp player have a good chance in beat them if they spend enough time into the game tutorial 9 good for beginner teach everything you need to know before you start graphic 7 pretty good for a mobile port be actually suprise gameplay 7 a bit more simple than an average yu gi oh game character 10 there be load of character from the first and second series that you can unlock and use with all there orginal english voice actor which actually suprise me aswell overall a 7 5 10 its a good game but it have its up and down as do many other card game kyouie,pos

early access reviewthe game mechanic and the map be nice but i have two complain the first one be the low variety of gamemode i like demolition and assassination because they be something new but i get bored over time the second complain be that most weapon feel the same for example almost all sniper do one shoot and there be no reason to buy m107 which deal 100 damage because you can buy a normal sniper with credit and still do one shot while damage be like 94 or 96 thus feel the same the rifles and smgs fall to one of 2 category high rpm low dmg low recoil or low rpm high damage high recoil some of them have a grenade launcher but that do not matter that much there be only 2 shotgun and i feel that they be way underpowered shotgun should deal more damage and one shoot up to 1 m even when i play with the high damage shotgun i can not seem to one shoot even at point blank i have to say that i feel diffrent with each lmg but not by a lot pistol be ok i guess but i would suggest add some more,pos
i have never write a review yet and the company who make this game just make me get this much out of my comfort zone recently they increase the cost of acquire in game content with in game nonbuyable currency while at the same time reportedly nerfe the income rate of mention currency mind you i be not talk about irl buyable currency a k a gold so i have not play for some time have a hard time grind enough of that nonbuyable currency to buy the next soldiertype and now after login they be again unreachable until i have grind some more this kind of price change have already happen to me at least once and never be mention beforehand so as a last measure i start to write this and after have send this comment i will uninstall this game let this be a warning to you possible new player if it happen to you tell you so i can not recommend this game any more,neg
ok so i understand the hate about this game and i agree some aspect be a little bad but over time i feel that these issue will resolve themselves even there be bad thing about that game there be also good thing about it too like original movie soundtrack and they even have the original movie cast as well even though this game be rough around the edge i believe that it will continue to get well,pos

so attempt to play this game multiple time and i can not seriously stick with it the game have a ton of potential as a former game reviewer i can see it however the game have some serious flaw hold it back first the the spawn system you spend the majority of your time run back to the objective in this game which can take between 30 second to a couple of minute depend on the game mode you play spawn point be purposely place away from any nearby objective give the enemy team an advantage to setup defense before an attack you can only create a squad of 3 other member and then queue with random player good luck try to get any organization with your team when it come to attack a fortify objective most people run in by themselves get kill and then have to run back and it be just a loop of one person go in and die second the game economy this game manipulate you or seduce you to try and spend real money on their game want to progress faster spend money on their premium service which give you boost to progress faster the game have a huge grind specifically for this purpose silver the in game currency come slowly and you need a ton of it to even purchase upgrade which have durability by the way for your weapon weapon upgrade vehicle etc the amount of silver you need to spend outweigh the amount you earn in the game third and most of all the game lock the main feature the bread and butter of the game war mode behind a level restriction time gate the actual content of the game force you to queue for small arena like match that a handful of player be actually play as such queue time be rather long i spend anywhere between 1 5 minute try to find a match during the day and even longer at night if you be hope to play the open world war zone in this game guess what you need to get to level 10 first before you can experience that content oh and if you want to experience any of the game many class such as recon paratrooper etc you will need to spend over 100k on each class or pay real money to unlock them this game try heavily to encourage people to spend money on their game instead of focus on the content itself the freemium element to this game kill it be potential i leave the game on and off due to the war mode be lock behind a grind wall i can not justifiably support this game with it be current model and practice and highly recommend people go into this game to go in with caution,neg

i actually do not recommend raceroom racing experience but i take a moment to look through some of the positive and negative review prior to write this and realize some thing which actually change my opinion of the game from the perspective of functional game content the one criticism i have which have not change be the sound i be not a professional racer i do not know what it sound like to be behind the wheel of one of these monstrosity but when i play a racing game with a 5 1 surround system i expect it to feel raw and powerful instead i find all of the vehicle to sound unbelievably anemic and whiny again i have no idea what these car may sound like in real life but this be a game its disappointing to see such aggressive speed machine yet hear whiny little rc car now one of the first thing i learn be that this be at least in some capacity the same people responsible for race07 i recently give that game a whirl and have a nauseatingly terrible experience with it whatever they learn from those past title they have clearly refine it and master it for raceroom i know a lot of time have pass between the two but its hard to think this quality sim be from the same people behind race07 great job dev keep up the iteration and self improvement the next thing i take a step back from complain about be the free to play model many of the negative review point out the frankly incomprehensible way in which content be be sell i think the model be confusing and poorly think out but i do not think the fact that you be expect to pay for the majority of the car when the game and a handful of vehicle be completely free be a point to merit a negative review the game be extremely detailed and as good i can tell extremely faithful to the physics behind circuit racing raceroom be not a free to play racing game in my eye its a demo for a well craft racing simulator that allow you to pay for exactly the content you want if you decide that the mechanic interest you i do not much enjoy it but raceroom racing experience be a free demo for a very high quality racing simulator if you be into this genre and like what you see in the screenshot you should absolutely try out the game there be literally nothing to lose by try it out,pos
it be poorly optimize when i launch it just get 2 fps and i need to wait half a minute for it to render soo it get playable it crash 40 of the time when i try to join a world if it do not crash i lose connection to the server server be pure bullcrap gameplay bore it be just farm simulator with world of warcraft element level up be too slow and boring same dungeon with different layout same enemy with different modelsit be repetitive,neg
if you want to have fun this game be not for you the game be tailor in a way that only by spend the most money in the game you can have a comptetitive deck maybe after play a year of f2p you can build a combo but by the time you do that the meta would have probably shift anyways so you will see the same deck at the top rank and even at low rank you can find people who obviously spend money on themed deck which be sad becase this game have potential to be very fun but instead it come out as another easy cash grab if you be go to spend money on card spend that money on the real card which at least have a value because this game server will be shut down sooner or later and i do not think anyone be get a refund,neg

i do not get why everyone be complain about the fact that you have to pay to play most of the game that be a normal thing these day if you bother to pay and you will not pay more than a normal game to get 3 month plus a good range of gear and then it be really cheap to renew your licence whenever you miss the game it be an amazing beautiful hunting game it really be ultra real and if you be opposed to hunt real animal but can see the fun otherwise then this be the game for you it be the only game where you will walk and even crawl most of the time and enjoy it it be a game that make good find rare so when they come they be really rewarding and challenging there be a thrill in hunt an animal across the gorgeous huge map and make sure you do not spook it you also get to hunt with friend which be a great pasttime grab a beer get a good microphone and head out into nature with your buddy and enjoy good old fashioned manly hunting try it it be free to try that s the point and you do get to go on a great map and hunt a deer that be as fun as all the other animal you can even go on the other map and find other animal you just can not shoot them but you can photograph them and see if you want to invest ignore the spoiled brat that want everything free and give this game a go p s i have play for over 100 hour via the website rather than steam,pos
early access reviewthis be easily the bad game i have ever buy buggy game decide when it allow you into the character selection screen sometimes on first attmept sometimes you haveto try 10 time the performance be awful even on a good gaming pc translation be a joke poison instead of position really the fov be too narrow you have to edit the ini file yourself for the game to use vertical fov instead of the too narrow horizontal fov people be mass dupe item from the ah which obviously mean totally broken economy the action combat something they be advertise only work with one class berserker all the other class do not have that feature the ui be impossible it be huge can not edit anything the game be run dx9 really it be 2018 this could all be excuse if it be a free game just about but the fact remain this be the most broken pile ofi have ever buy and no it be not early access the game be a few year old now and nothing have change lucky enough steam refund the game pretty much immediately which be great avoid,neg

can not reccomend this game after month of try to beat the campaign i have to give up i cannnot progress without spend money and the campaign boss actively cheat have script card that you can not seem to defend against if you just want to have a time waster to play without invest money and play only multiplayer do not waste your time on this game maybe i would change my tune if they give you a single player arena to fight ai deck without have to pay 1 99 every time you want to have a break from lose endlessly on the campaign,neg
early access reviewplaye this game after 50 hour be hell imagine bf4 but downgrade by 1000000000000000 yea this game be free but i would rather pay the 20 buck the game be worth than play this game the progression be super slow so it be go to take a while to get gun and well vehicle the only way to get around it be by pay for gold which be pay with real money one of the good weapon in the game be more than 10 buck what yep more than 10 buck for one gun again sorry for compare but if you pay another 10 buck you will get bf4 which have no t gold system and the progression be much faster another thing about this game be the balance btw balance be not even a thing in this game the gun fight be fairly balanced however but the vehicle just no tank and plane be way to op in this game since many people do not carry anti armor weapon this be because no one start with anti armor weapon regard your class and the rocket launcher be super expensive there be some aa gun on the map to take down the plane but it seem as if no one be use them side note the american standard grenade be super op as well another thing that factor into the poorly balanced game be the general basically anyone who spit out money can be a freakin general the role of these general be to provide you with specific squad in each battle each squad have its own purpose and you can only spawn certain vehicle in each squad which lead to very unbalanced combat i have have game where my team have have 6 tank spawn in and the other team only have less than 3 vice versa i have be on team where we have have no squad to spawn in vehicle lead us to get poope on i kinda feel like the other team just finish eat bad truck food and they poope out the spawn of satin and make our team eat it um yea bikesquadshoutout to my boi noah and neil for be the the bikesquad also shoutout to my favorite teacher mr galso shoutout to my boi justin the baller also shoutout to my boi franco horny guy also shoutout to my boi tom horny guy 2,neg

early access reviewi have download this game through steam and my mobile phone and be try not to play it too much this game remind me a lot of magic the gathering i do not have anyone to play mtg with locally so this be a surprising and welcome find an excellent alternative to mtg consider my circumstance the different colored faction behave much the same as the different color of mtg so the game be very easy to pick up there be more play option available on this game than any mtg app i have find so replayability longevity be not a go to be an issue if you be in the same boat as me you like play mtg but do not have anyone to play with as often as you would like i highly recommend get this game there be many many similarity to mtg so you should not have an issue get the hang of the game and if you and your friend download this through steam you will have the enjoyment of play with your friend even if you do not live close to each other,pos
i have not play this game in five year due to hardware issue so when i get a new computer i be excited to play this game again but the new update have xigncode which kick me from the game as so as it be launch i have look online for solution but all i find be make sure there be no background program run but elsword and steam be the only program running shame because i would have rate this a stellar 5 out of 5 sadly in its current state i would not recommend the byte this take up 0 5 unplayable,neg
early access reviewi quite enjoy this game since i want to scratch my mtg itch it do a lot of stuff right the game speed be nice gui be enhance the experience and there be a sense of progression as you grind your way up what i do not like be unfortunately a core mechanic of the standard game dead draw how can they still be in a new card game it feel so punish draw resource card when you want some kind of answer for the board on top of that the deck size be 75 card with a maximum of 4 copy per card and you be force to make 1 3 of the deck resource card this game want you to use a more water down deck than mtg increase the rng and restrict your deck building even more i really feel this be a core problem with the game so much so that i would not recommend it from what i have see this be also the nail in the coffin for other player in my mind the fix for this problem would be allow hero avatar power the 5 campaign hero each already have their own 2 mana spell which have a little effect gain 2 armor and draw you a resource card why not make it a permanent ability also remove the 1 3 of deck force resource so people have more freedom to build i think i will spend a little more time with this game but once i be bored i will not revisit it again unless there be a core change that tackle the dead draw problem i only wish this promising game would stop stick with frustrating mechanic of the past or else it will die rather quickly,neg
this be definitely a pay to win game i put in about 100 hour on android and i know that it be p2w from the start they rig the card you draw i literally fill it with mostly monster and only draw only my spell card in a row i have 50 monster and 50 spell trap and literally keep get only spell or only monster i even make it 70 monster and 30 spell trap and still get nothing but spell somehow i be only use the peak performance skill the entire time i even put multiple copy of the same card only to draw every other card except duplicate i even experiment my card draw with a friend only to draw every other card except for my most powerful card which be always conveniently place at the very bottom of my deck i have mostly play with my friend and they literally see it on my livestream that i would draw similar card during my 1st or 2nd turn and we even play about 30 40 match in a row only to happen every single time they even rig the dice roll card to give you the bad dice roll as much as possible because these card be so powerful that they would stomp most card that be mostly lock behind a paywall it go against their profit motive to simply rely on skill for use the right card at the right moment i have the dangerous machine type 6 and it literally give me a 6 dice roll 18 time in a row across all my match always self destruct my card each time i only get to use it to it be full effect only 2 time and the rest be nothing but 1 or 6 i mostly play with my friend and even when they have card more powerful than mine i have win more match against them this just prove how massively rig the rng system be and do my own personal research the math do not make any sense and pretty much force you to buy the most op deck behind the paywall if you be f2p be prepare to lose a lot of match and do a ton of grinding to unlock skill if you do not believe that the card draw be rig they literally have a feature call skill that can be apply to your character how be this a skill when you literally give a player an advantage to pull certain card out of theirthat cmpletely break the game what a joke here be a list of the skill below balanceif your deck consist of 10 monster card and 10 spell trap card you will have 2 monster and 2 spell trap in start hand draw sense spell trapcan be use each time your life point decrease by 1800 in the draw phase instead of do a normal draw draw a random spell trap card destiny drawcan be use each time your life point decrease by 2000 in the draw phase instead of do a normal draw draw the card of your choice draw sense high levelcan be use each time your life point decrase by 1800 in the draw phase instead of do a normal draw draw a random level 7 or more monster heavy starterif your deck have 3 or more level 5 or high monster with different name you will have improve chance of have a level 5 or high monster in your start hand,neg
i start play this because i be under the mistaken assumption it provide unlock in fallout 4 it do not if you have the same misconception so why the negative review and the answer be that the game use tedium and enforce grinding as a gameplay mechanic and it do not have to the game concept itself be novel enough and if you like the fallout universe it be pretty cute it be simple but it be mean for mobile device so that make sense build a vault manage your settler fight baddie for loot rinse wash and repeat all of that be just well and dandy the problem arise from the fact that there be basically no ai and everything be agonizingly manual resource get produce gather those sucker manually loot get find gather that stuff manually danger at the vault manually tell people to go help and then go to the next room when the danger spread rather than remember why they be send ready to give birth not until the overseer deliver your kid themself it go on and on it be micromanagement without depth which mean that it be just a chore at the end of the day well that and wait the combat system be 95 wait and not whilst the app game be close sit there and watch healthbars slowly fall hope you will get a crit and somethingf to do and then they hit you with the pay content to make thing quicker easy and more automated you literally pay to play less and be bother less nothing against pay content they have a right to make money from their work but pay content should give you more of the game not less of the annoyance top tier weapon just less wait in combat you can bypass the whole process by not play it at all,neg

oh where to begin with neverwinter now this review will most likely bring on a lot of controversy but who care neverwinter be a f2p mmorpg publish by perfect world now a lot of perfect world game tend to be pay to win to the extreme neverwinter be not pay to win unlike the other the only thing to win in neverwinter be pvp but pvp be not a big part of the game itself and there be no item you can pay real life money for to help you in pvp of course neverwinter have an in game currency call zen that you can pay real life money for but the only thing zen let you buy be fashion item dye companion mount and a few other item not essential to own now of course like many other mmo in game currency like zen can allow you to pay for convenience such as buy a fast mount mount serve no purpose other than get you where you need to go at a quick rate rather than walk be that pay to win no it be not what be you win a race to the quest area people do not like spend real life money on mmos but the game be free be it not so complain be silly anways the main currency in neverwinter that require no real life money to earn be call astral diamond you do not want to spend real life money on neverwinter have no fear with ad you can purchase companion mount and plenty of other neat item though for a price 25k ad be the max you can earn with your daily quest however every dungeon you play you have a 90 chance of obtain a purple item purple item sell for a fair amount of ad on the auction house whether its to 20k or 1mill so really earn ad be not an issue me i have play neverwinter since beta two year ago and have never spend a dime to get the cool item i desire i just play the game and earn ad which as state before be not as hard as people say it to be the point of play a game be earn what you want and work towards your goal but many be lazy and do not want to work for what they want i also forget to mention if you really want something off the zen market but have no desire to pay real life money for exclusive item on it do you know you can trade ad for zen be not that nice that neverwinter allow you to do that they give you every option in the game to get what you want without pay a single cent i do not know about you but that s very nice especially for a free game in game event also happen often and every event give you a chance to get a very unique item of some kind whether its so a very cool fast mount a strong companion or just a silly item like a portable throne now let talk about the worker behind neverwinter that be really a great group of people they constantly work hard daily to keep neverwinter run add new content very often and keep it bug free the employee be also very easy to get ahold of and they be the most helpful bunch that will assist you with anything you need its very important for a game to have that they also play neverwinter and they even take the time to play with player in game and occasionally help out people in need how cool be that they also stream on twitch often and give away in game item and even phsyical item like t shirt so overall neverwinter be one of the best free to play mmo out right now there be a reason i have be play this game since beta it even have an epic story line unlike many other mmos that do not like everybody else i skip dialog i do not care i just want to play with neverwinter everything about it whether its to the lore or story line be so very intriguing and make you want to really understand what s go on and pay attention neverwinter be also very visually stunning and the amount of work and detail put into this game be really quite amazing do not believe me check out my screenshot and look at my neverwinter one you will also see that i have an epic mount easily obtain by earn ad like mmorpg want a game full of endless content you can spend countless hour on do you like dungeon and dragon then take the time to play neverwinter,pos
early access reviewthe game be a bit good but graphic be a little bad but still a fun game to play however the premium currency be unobtainable through simple non pay gameplay although its still in open beta so they probably make dragon crystal obtainable soon the leveling up system be a bit grindy consider the lvl cap be still at 15 it will probably change soon but still look forward for the full release,pos

this game be a complete grindfest back when it first come out it have some potential as a fun and somewhat competitive ww2 shooter with decent graphic now that be not the case you will always get kill by someone who pay more than you do in this game the dev ruin this game with their horrible decision to include microtransaction upon microtransaction simple decision to switch a character between role job pilot paratrooper tankman etc cost ingame or real money you finally want to play the game so you play 2 3 round now you have to pay for the ammo you shoot now you have to repair your weapon what be that you want to modify your weapon that cost money too and you have to repair those modification too the list go on and on do not support this game until the dev get their act together and stop rip people off with endless force microtransaction,neg

life traverse be exceptional for forceful shooter hardly a month go by without new virtual field spring up and appeal you into some fresh conflict and only a few surely understand redirection make sense of how to oversee dynamic player basis even a year after their hide release what be more a short time later there be team fortress 2 release in 2007 this class base commendable be so far go strong particularly into its seventh year in view of its vigorous and innovative gathering since gamespots one of a kind tf2 review the entertainment have benefit from different upgrade and make the skip to a permit to play plan of activity the middle action pit two gathering of player against each other in a battle to get center move a truck or take an organizer case the objective be always uncommonly clear it be the exchange between the nine playable class that make thing so varied and interesting the convenient scout the assailant generous the tireless pro the conspiring specialist the irritating sharpshooter the tricky see the feisty pyro the shaky trooper and the fundamentally more risky demoman all have exceptional weapon attribute and limit that supplement each other and strife in bundle way encounter can vary comprehensively depend upon the match sort and the beautifier of each gathering and this strangeness be dire to tf2s long stand solicitation when you leave the door as a mind boggle with a specialist near to you be a force unfriendly constrain yet if a spy hover around to deceive the specialist and you round the corner on a pyro it can all come unwound in a matter

spending for any of this stuff it be divert to see some visual grouping as you endeavor to light your adversary on fire the good difference from the redirection beginning come in the accommodate mode mann versus machine in it you and a few other human player must maintain a strategic distance from swarm of robotized incarnation of tf2s class from pass on a bomb to your base the money you pick up from pulverize robot can be spend on mid organize climb to your quality and weaponry which can be essential to accomplishment for sure even on the most easy level the robot armed force be adequately wild to test the gut of a messy gathering this be a mode where absolutely mastermind weapon choice and defensive framework can mean the differentiation among succeed and attempt endeavor afresh you

that it do not have the energized oddity of center play the supportive mode can even now offer satisfaction to those adequately commit to see it through however contention be the honest to goodness draw and the team fortress 2 gathering can completely be engage on a couple of server you may be scold for unwitting crack of respectability while on other you may be welcome with pleasing tip and ubercharges you can even demand help on particular server and be correspond with another player why ought to willing give you a couple tip through talk the society around tf2 be a charming one not just for their significant learning of and vitality for the delight yet for their imaginative attempt in arrange new weapon thing and map that have since end up be a bit of the experience it feel like a gathering of manager without whom the delight may well have dwindle away and go into obsolete nature year earlier stay imperative even a year after release be extraordinary for an engaged shooter yet heres team fortress 2 still overflow after seven year in the business every so often it feel like comparable diversion you could have play back then and at various time it feel like no one will

let start with a pro and con list of the game from someone who be not super big on free2play but choose to give this one a shot because it look decent pro the dev be constantly work on the game to make improvement and bug fix multiple game mode to appeal to a wide audience than just a handful option between first person and third person point of view amazing money point system where you gather money as you kill zombie and player and can use that money in the marketplace to buy thing like extra ammo gear vehicle etc and it be all stuff you can buy without pay real top dollar although they do have a real money form of currency for skin and to make your stuff look nifty but i mean come on it be a f2p they need to make money someway and honestly i would say this be not a p2w game due to the fact the bulk of what you buy be just bs skin like a knock off csgo thing talent tree be fun so as you gather exp from kill you can spend it to make you not lose health as fast hit harder less recoil etc gameplay be immensly impressive not choppy laggy at least not on the na server if you be in the middle of kill someone and they try to auto disconnect to save theirand so you do not get point it do not work there be a 10 second disconnect timer for when scumbag try to pull stuff like that you can log off whenever wherever you want you do not respawn in the same place regardless of if you connect to the same server would love to see more map but hey it be already an amazing f2p and even with just the few map they have i never find them repetitive or boring because it be all about survive and while play you be always so into just do that that whatever map be choose do not even matter while you be run for your life from a horde of zombie or a player whom you think be friendly and be now chase you down the street in nothing but a motorcycle helmet while wield a machete so many pro but i would like to go have a smoke break so onto the con this game be basically just a compton simulator or a canada simulator i do not know both place suck run down building and tweaker or zombie roam the street suck you have to pay real mulah to get cool skin on your gun but aye just like cs semi cancerous community but there be always those few really cool guy to group up and run with when you die you drop all your stuff which suck but aye that s part of the game get over it or get off much love to the dev for be ontop of their stuff with bug fix and update you guy be amazing and this be one hell of a game for a f2p smoke break time stinky pete,pos
try to master gun be so fun in this game i like to put on some music and just pick apart tec 9s and aks and see how much i can do before i mess up its hard to progress and the gun be not as plentiful as the pic make them look but the game be free so top do not listen to negative reviewer and just try it,pos
discount hearthstone bad aggro deck everywhere they ruin the game and if you do not spend real money you be go to be far behind twitch drop be a thing but they be a joke the drop rarely show up and if you they do they give you crap do not bother with this game the first hour playing be fun but after the campaign the game show its true color,neg
uhm this little masterpiece should not be free of charge for what it offer it be really quite an amazing survival game kudo to bethesda keep up the good work 9 10 be a fallout fan since 98,pos
do not play this game the game itself be really amazing well done and really enjoyable but konami really fail this time it be free and this mean that you can play without spend money and this make your deck build time extremely longer i spend personally 30 day play hard to create my free deck but the point be that for this kind of deck you need skill you can get the skill by defeat the legendary duelist in game now after 49 day of duel vs legendary duelist with a very high average of scoring point 7 8k 8k be the max i do not have the skill yet and it be not buyable or obtainable by increase lvl moreover the ultrarare and super rare drop rate be ridiculous even score 8k of duel point vs a lvl 40duelist i score the max a lot of time and i have even not see a single super rare skill for the most of time people play the game to have fun for hobby and to pass a good timec in my opinion 79 day to create a deck and i be work n progress be definitely too much be not fun anymore moreover 3 pack cost 2 29 and every pack contain 3 card for the digital card be insane you can not even buy the exact card or skill konami should increase the drop rate and the skill obtain process to make this game consistent and funny i kown their aim be make money but this make the game annoy you spend money ok create more deck and faster you send no money no competitive game age of tme to create a consistent and effective deck just to let you know my sta up to date 79 day of play most in android 3824 duel almost 20k of diamond use for deck no skill seriously,neg
early access reviewthis game be literally everything pubg should have be on launch this game also have an interesting end game scenario instead of be the last player alive to achieve victory a heli fly down and drop a ladder and offer extraction for a total of 4 passenger to escape from the blizzard you may think well that be not too much fun player will just camp the ladder up into the heli that be true however to keep that playstyle from be abuse too much after a certain amount of time player be reveal on the map force a potential extraction or intense gunfight while in pubg it be whoever can stay prone the long until you spot a potential kill great idea and for me personally well execute it bring some freshness to the genre gun play be great too also the game be fast than pubg but it be not over in 10 minute either it be just the right amount of time there be so much more but i will let you all explore this game yourself of course the game have it be problem too as many do some minor frame drop and lag here and there from what i have experience but it be not game break at all nor a reason not to play it note i be compare this to pubg because they be so damn similar an many many way and i feel this game do it all 1 000 time well and it be free 10 10,pos
i have previously play the game i like it and re instal it but i have some graphical issue like glitch also game freeze sometimes i have amd grahics card it be say that these glitch be because of amd graphic card it be the programmer job to make compatible game to amd card so i uninstalle the game i do not recommend the game if you amd card else the game be not bad,neg
you do not need to pay hundred of dollar to enjoy this game you can get the starter membership bundle for 15 and get three month of licence to hunt all animal and two weapon along with unlimated basic ammo three of which exclusive for the shotgun you can hunt all big game with slug round and all small game with birdshot and 12ga buck so with that you can already hunt all the specie in the game i have get the 15 starter membership and i have already take down most of the specie without have to buy any special gear beyond what i get with the base game and starter membership if you enjoy hunt and would not mind drop 10 every three month then this game be for you if you do not have 10 to drop every three month then maybe check out cotw which be a one time purchase but imo not as fun as thc in it be current state,pos
early access reviewi mean it have a okay storyline but the graphic be just uhg i mean its a free game what do you expect its good for mess around in but not for a genuine game not to mention how small it be,neg
play this game for year it be one of my favourite game and while the dev can put out some fantastic work they sadly seem to be at this point incredibly out of touch with the game and it be community get to top tier will literally take thousand of hour of incredibly slow and painful grinding and when you finally reach top tier it be terrible truly aweful top tier consist of get slaughter by helicopter while you be powerless to stop it unless you have enough point to spawn a fighter jet get one shot from the other side of the map in your spawn and horribly balanced vehicle that completely dominate anything that be not metathe list go on and on but there be just so many issue that ruin this once amazing game that i love so dearlyplease do not buy into the money grab that this game have become now and spend your time do something more enjoyable,neg
probably the best competitive game make in any genre will be play by human forever it be a steep learning curve but it be the game we will watch world cup in when we be retire so you better learn it now oh and do i say its the most fun to play since you be back to square one in every game and 40 minute be enough of a grinding span require teamplay twitch skill lore understanding tactic strategy awarness ball good judgment reaction anticipation intuition time sense people sense empathy multi tasking spatial and temporal awareness and focus,pos
play this game for 3 day due to the free 3 day premium and then get rid of it from your steam library the entire game be base around premium feature such as premium ammo premium consumable and buy your way to the top convert free money to premium ammo be non sustainable even if you do win with top gun and 10 other medal and start off with free crew be just ask to be farm for 100 game because 50 crew be so blind that they can not even see a tank in front of them even if they be 100 meter in front of you in plain sight and no camo bonus when you do get to the top you will eventually realize that the only reason you put so much effort into this tiering up be because you want to play a game where player have a even advantage but you end up realize that high tier game be exclusively for wallet warrior,neg
smite be an amazing game but hi res be the bad they make too many stun mechanic some god be break af and just annoying to play against i also always get new player as a team and more experienced player as enemy which can be very annoying when you want the quest daily reward please fix,pos

early access reviewhonestly there be a bug where it get stick on the authorization screen but sometimes you just need to refresh the game it be a very fun game after that there may be a lot of hacker but sometimes there be not i fully recomend this game if you do not have enough money for csgo or call of duty,pos
just to get this straight this game be just like freak minecraft but positively like minecraft the game start off as a tutorial and when your in the tutorial you get to pick between a variety of class originally the main class you got to pick in the beta of the game when it first start be a knight a gunslinger a candy barbarian or a dracolyte classesknight mainly use for tanking can withstand many enemy great damage close range have a passive skill that when hit your next attack deal more damage the great thing about knight it be good for soloing but damage be not that great gunslinger have an advantage at range use a gun good for damage have a passive skill that when shoot in the air while attack an enemy in the air while airborne your next charge shot will be instantly charge without cost candy barbarian mainly use melee weapon as an advantage close range can withstand many enemy skill provide healing and can hit multiple target good for damage or for solo dracolyte this be most likely a overrated class in my opinion but i be not say the other three class be bad but this class have just get more advantage and it be just so overpowered to use use a staff and the freaking skill be a flamethrower that last forever until the enemy die the most awesome thing about the last or ultimate skill of this class be that you get to transform into a fire breathe dragon that be most powerful than your flamethrower and it can literally annihilate everything well i be just exaggerate if you know what gear to equip also in trove you get to build your own house and make cool pixel like pokemon and other stuff which be like the thing you need to build in minecraft but your go to have to mine for block just to build stuff in that case the game be fun building be enjoyable and have a fire breathe dragon be the most cool thing i have ever see in my life,pos
this be my fourth year of play smite and i have love it up until probably around the last year or so this be my easy go to game for fun on my own or with my friend tonight be what finally end it for me there have be problem for the last few month of hi rez release overpowered god but the recent patch be freya be change finally come to create its downfall for me i do not feel that the most recent god pele be unbalanced and i think that smite may be recover from the unfortunate recent history of make certain god overpowerered and nerfe the heck out of god who use to be fun to play however when one god in this case freya can hit you for 2x your maximum health grant i be play a hunter it become no longer fun to play the game you try to play a god because you enjoy them but there be break god still in the game that prevent you from be able to play a normal balanced god your only option be to play another broken god and the game lose its excitemnent that be arond since it first be release as a beta i be sorry to all of the new smite player who be hope to join the community it just be not the same game it be a couple of year ago i truely enjoy this game once but my time with it have come to an end,neg

i give this a shot after year of wait and it become free i want to fall asleep while i be play it i guess if you have insomia and want to fall asleep you can play this game to help even with a gtx1050 the frame rate still stutter besides the beautiful character creation which be i think be on par with bdo it be really lackluster everything scream stiff the world be kinda bland and combat be this strange stiff and boring tab target it attempt to do gw2 quest style but the world and story just be not as immersive or flesh out i still can remember till today gws 2 norn world with thier frozen keg but bless be just forgettable there just be not enough culture weave into the race i do not recommend you to play it unless you need insomia relief ps they be release bless unleash on console with rework combat and storyline,neg
i really enjoy creativerse i do wish the bio bed could be rotate around to lay flat on the floor for some of my room idea but other than that i find my self loose my self in the game when ever i play it,pos
early access reviewit be a minecraft clone but it do have it be own unique style and attribute one major complaint i have with it be that be crash a lot i mean a lot it crash on me 4 time within an hour but it be early access as of right now so it be more excusable all in all it be a good game and it be free unlike minecraft in the current state the game be in i would give it a 7 10,pos
this game be fun and addicting however with their recent expansion solo content have become nearly impossible unless you pretty much pay to play as in buy your gear with irl money,neg
early access reviewwhile this game be great consider its beta i feel that onve you hit the corruption level the exploration stop and there s nothing leave to do but build i would very much like to see several more layer add to the world each with its own unique biom and material you need to harvest to get to the next level below other than that i would very much encourage you to pick this game up soley for the multiplayer aspect like the free server save to steam so you can play on a friend server without them be online 10 10 would grief my friend again,pos
this be by far the good game i ever play whoever say that tf2 be die andis wrong because of 1 or 2 bad update do not mean the game isand we as the community should know that and support valve for keep alive this masterpiece but instead you just quit the game because you be never happy with what you have,pos
this be a dissapointing game i be a fan of the film and tv series and this game be a let down it do not feel like a well make game for pc and i bet it be a port from the mobile market i fly hookfang in the early training mission and i know paper plane which have more weight to them than that dragon you play as some randomer viking and the goal be to be the ultimate dragon trainer but that not that intersting a goal it be a mmorpg be what the game be ruin by in my opinion they could have have the main cast as playable character and have adventure like in the show it have the music from the series and the character and that be well model so they have that but i do not want to play it for long before it put me off the series,neg
early access reviewthe game use to be good trust me you do not want to play i have be keep up with the patchnotes and some other stuff relate to it only because i be too lazy to unfollow them on facebook the patch seem to be follow the pattern i see in the day lead up to my departure from the playerbase about a year ago i have notice their desperate attempt to add band aid feature and balance that be mean to appease their fan and keep them around and have them pay 2 win the dlc be not worth their cost at all 35 dollar for a flyer that will not last 5 second in a match lmao and 50 for premium wtf at most its worth 10 at most i have sink so many hour into this game because once upon a time it be a good game and then they slip on the stair and fall down into the depth of hell itself how idk supposedly at some point freejam be in major debt to its parent company and so they introduce the crate system as a way to convice player to buy crate and premium in order to pay off their parent company since they be still around it seem like that work even though it should not have the crate system be literally a fester cancer as they add new item that be cancer to use the reward pool grow decrease your chance of get anything decent then again the drop rate be rig in a way that very rarely do something decent drop and it be most likely in the premium row of item so you need to be feed them money in order to get it premium be never worth the price in the early day all it do be double your currency income which mean that you could sealclub all the newbie as a newbie back then i can say that sealclubbing be a very common occurence it take me 6 month thank to that to actually get to the mid tier after a while they add color so that you could color your bot however you want and of course there be a catch you need premium to get more than 3 color white an ugly sky blue and an ugly off orange and after crate you need premium to get decent item or in most case more item to sell at what feel like pawnshop to save up your penny for that badass weapon that be the current meta but thank to the pawnshop like sell it would take you literally year to save up enough to get 1 of that item let alone the 3 or 4 you would need for it to be viable and by that time the dev would have initiate at least 4000 different meta in the early day everything be relatively balanced of course there be way to exploit it but it be not that bad after a while the game become extremely unbalanced addition of new movement type and or weapon so they do some quick patch to fix that r i p balance that set the game into a death spiral of cancerous meta while that may sound bad on paper its far bad in reality bad than a plane spiral to the ground while its tail section and one of its wing fall silently beside it there be the over tiered tank tank build with low tier armour and equip with gun from many tier above the armour possible because of the way your bot tier be determine so slap some tier 2 armor on then slap some tier 7 gun on go rek the tier 4 people ggez but tier be remove so good bye over tiering then come the flak cannon rip flyer of all kind then come rocket rip everything then come the hover with the tiny corner triangle i forget what they be actually call which zip around in the sky be invisible and obliterate everything then come the ultra tanky mech absorb all the damage and destroy everything then come the shotgun then come the tiny cloak tesla melee basically bot after that i leave no surprise really i be sure there be be even more cancerous meta since i leave too sad thing be there be probably more than i think which be say something cause i think its a ton there be always be build restriction you have never be able to build what you want its sad really because there be so much potential in the concept you want to know the sad part of the entire popularity of this game even the most popular robocraft youtuber rosefall leave because he get feed up with how much the game have drift from its good ole day rosefall have move on to big and well thing you can search up his channel if you want to see what happen for yourself really the only remain popular robocraft youtuber be gromek999 and jac733 i can only assume that they be pay by freejam to continue make video that shed a positive light on this game i do not know how anyone could make a positive video on robocraft anymore even if they be pay they could pay me 10mil a video and i still would refuse to brainwash the uneducated young into waste their life and their parent money on such a game in conclusion do not waste a single second on this game but even more importantly do not spend a single penny on this game freejam do not deserve your money,neg
i download this on the second beta run my son and i thoroughly enjoy play this one of the feature i most appreciate be that i can play it on my tablet pc or iphone however i must say my hat go off to anyone who have master play this on their phone i also appreciate the fact that the developer have make this available for free and that you can easily play win and progress without pay to play since i do not believe anything should be free and we enjoy play this so much i have happily spend my hard earn cash in the game which enable you to enjoy more tank and fast experience i be sure many die hard wot fan will consider this trivial in comparison to the full game but for those of us who like to pop in and out for a quick distration now and then it be a perfect format we enjoy play this game so much we start our own clan mayhm look us up when your in the game and feel free to appy for membership we will be dissmisse many member with preference towards player from steam look me up metalmayhemmasterhappy hunting,pos

i would like to say this mmo be great it have a wonderful system that be in place which be the ability to create your own map for the game if you be tired of the content that have be create many people feel it be a pay 2 win game it be not unless you make it that way that be the real situation overall though there be nothing that you can not do in the game to play it and get to the same level as everyone else the situation be how much you want to devote to the game to get to whatever progress you as a player want however as a free to play game there be a lot of free content that a person can go into and i recommend to eventually get into a guild or make sure you do all the require high level content to get some of the well gear i know recently there be some network issue but i believe it have smooth itself out some and have become playable again i recommend this game to the hardcore or even the casual player because the quest be instance base but very quick at time it be only the raid that be a little longer and more involve also make sure to do your daily but everything be solid for that mmo and recommend it to anyone,pos
i decide to give this game a try and i end up around 20 minute walk among tree and grass i manage to find some building area just to realize they be crowd with zombie i could not find a weapon anywhere only food and some armor and the basic backpack have only a few slot so i could not even pick everything it be a dreadful and tedious experience i spend 95 of the time sprint try to find a weapon or someone in a full server i do not die at all but definitely not the survival experience i be hope for,neg
in a pvp game it be important that each player have to at least play by the same rule this be not the case with this game certain game mechanic be different for different operating system this give an advantage to mobile gamer by necessity i would not recommend this game it be a naked cash grab and on a pc you have little change against a mobile gamer who be not absolutely terrible i be a fan of tower defense game and the bloon series be very disappointed uninstalle now,neg

early access review edit here i be revisit this game and i m just leave with less hope for it than before this game be just a mockery for the people who play it and a mockery of what a great game it use to be and it s only because people be actually progress back then without have to spend a peny so my guess be that fj have realize that and decide to send everyone down the ing rng lootcrate t system and on top of that put a second row of item ussually the well one whenever you open a crate so that they can tease our wallet out great ing work good job bravo and a round of applause please for fj the company that manage to create a good fun game that everyone love and trow it down the sewer unboxing simulator 2016 bad update simulator 2016freejam you for ture a fun game into an endless rng t system bring back the thech tree and rp by the way the game be now in early access but before it be in beta freejam you e pusscake,neg
early access reviewthis be the most stable game in alpha i have play with that in mind it be natural to expect the game to change many time before beta they have change revert a few thing so take some of the overtly critical review with a grain of salt realm be a formidable offering in the genre give more reliable shooting than fortnite without the building while bring the addition of class skill for more variety,pos
early access reviewlet me preface this with the fact that i have play this game for year now i start this game when the only mode you could play be training and battle there be no respawns and no objective other than to kill the other team and have the good robot i love this game allow me to walk you through my experiance 1 spend 50 hour grind to level 100 with friends2 spend 50 hour and some money to support the dev grind and come up with an amazing megabot idea3 spend 70 hour and some money to keep the subscription up build your megabot and grind for money for parts4 new update oh loot drop uh ok oh my megabot be entirely red why oh no cpu they remove megabot thank for ruin a game dev if you want thisto come back as a playable game you need to remove all these update bring it back to what the game use to be about creation and imagination as for right now do not give these people money or time this game have go from an amazing free team base sandbox vehicle battleground to another fine example of terrible dev,neg
  overall fairly good game to play with friend use the join feature very envolve gameplay when you try to level up and complete dungeon to aquire more loot appart from the long queue i definitely recommend it pro private open world exploration with friend in club feature 11 class item reward in dungeon lair equilibrate with death penalty con in this version usually 30 minute queue low character customization just face,pos
i like game like this personally not for everyone but it be nice to pass the time with only thing i would like be if the outfit and weapon come in a pack like the hair instead of have to pay for them separately and also make it cheap if keep individual i would be more willing to actually buy them in support of the dev overall a fun and simple game,pos
early access reviewthis game be really really good although it do not really bring anything new on the table it manage to create solid balance and interaction on its own and i would definitely recommend it as an alternative to mtg this game could be the next big tcg if more people be willing to try it,pos
early access reviewthe tldr here be that if you be look for something less broken and trash than pubg but you do not quite want to play fortnite with 12 year old then i guess this game have you cover oh and no you be not that good it be just that this game backfill match with bot this be another battle royale game it be right there in the title right next to realm realm royale be not really do anything new or exciting outside some minor tweak to the gameplay of your standard battle royale game you drop into the map from an airship you land find chest to get weapon and ability then you kill your way to be the last person or squad stand one thing realm royale do do differently be the class sytem in similar game you more or less drop in as the same person no one person have some edge over the other except for skill and mastery of the glitch in the game in realm royale however there be 4 class mage assassin hunter and warrior they each play the exact same and can use the same weapon and abiltie however they do have small buff to certain weapon if use and drop into the map with different starting movement ability the mage can fly the assassin can blink the hunter and dodge roll and the warrior have a super jump there be some other movement abiltie such as invisibility or a charge attack but those will have to be forge during the round or find in random chest the other thing the game do slightly differently be the life system in other game when you take too much damage you go into a bleed or down state and have to be revive by a squadmate or in the case of solo queueing die instantly you can be further damage in this downed state and kill but eventually you will bleed out if someone doenst revive you in realm royale however when you go down you just turn into a chicken you can still move and take cover albeit with reduce movement and unable to defend yourself and eventually you will b e back in fighting shape if you be not kill while you be in chicken form you can be chickene 3 time before you die for good but then you can still be revive by a squad memeber at a forge grant they can afford the revive and be not kill before the rez timer count down i will say that the choice to put loot inside independantly lootable chest be a great idea it stop me from miss thing on the ground because i do not notice the muddy black texture on top of the muddy brown and it stop the friendship destruction by make them independatly lootable so there be no debate over who get what you can share the loot if you do not want it and the game smartly place a pickup timer to stop people from steal yourif you turn your back for a microsecond but after the timer run out it be free game this system be actually pretty good i think they need to do a well job let me know which loot be mine in a pile of new item but overall it be decently well implement i mention above that this game backfill with bot this be something i do not know go in but become really obvious after a single match bot often run straight at you and either have pre cognition and aimbot or get stick on geometry and just eat bullet until they die this game do not have a lot of player right now so i imagine a large portion of the match i play be over half fill with bot often the last few player be the only real human in the match to begin with i be not really upset with this because it mean that you will not be queue forever if the game can not matchmake enough people but it be something to be aware of heres the thing right if you want another battle royale game there be probably bad option out there somewhere but right now this game only do just enough to differentiate itself that i would only reccomend it if you have a couple of friend willing to download it with you,pos
early access reviewit be a great game with plenty of thing to scare you the scary for me be the violent deer and that deer god thing the game would be well if it have full controller support other than that it be perfect it be startling scary and spine tingle not for the average gamer oh and if you though five night at freddys be bad try this have fun,pos

early access reviewsimple beat em up sidescroller game very smash bro like whilst its nothing new its definitely special and consider its free everyone on steam should definitely grab a couple friend and give brawlhalla a spin,pos
early access reviewthis game be a mix of cod and cs go the game be not that bad and it do not take much time to get the hang of it because you do not need any skill to play some thing need to be improve and fix like the authorization screen the spawn camping add anti cheat system because it be full of hacker and also die randomly and say that i be kill by my self when those little bug be fix i will give the game a positive review 12 10 would get kill by my self again,neg
  i have never hear of the new z before it come out on steam and try it out for the first time yesterday first off i want to say this game be free meaning there should be no reason for you to listen to review you should play it and see if you like it or not for a free game it be actually alright there be no pay to win element what so ever except be able to buy premium which be like unturned premium yes you can buy med and ammo for real life money but you can also do so with ingame money which be easy to get in my 3 hour i have well over 150 grand which be more than 20 dollar can buy this game be mainly pvp with med that have cool down to use during fight barricade to block off bullet and a sweet arcade feel for combat that be not realistic at all kill zombie be quite rewarding as well and there be a skill gap in this game you can find clan that go in together and run part of the map on server so skilled gamer will enjoy this game remember this be not a survival game but a shooter with zombie where you find loot like meds armor gun etc and then go to pvp that be the whole game but it be fun to play and free all negative reviewer be e stupid or be rate this way to harshly overall 7 10 fun to play with friend every now and then and free,pos
great first person shooter with massive map and massive battle with potentially hundred of player on each side there be 3 faction vanusovereignity neoconglomerate and terrainrepublic vs be sci fi style with hovertank and plasma weapon their weaponry be mix nc be mercenary with gauss weapon their main battletank be close to normal tank they have heavy emphasis towards shotgun tr be the empire they use regular weaponry and tend to have large clip on their weapon their main battletank have 2 barrel the good quality of ps2 be that its sandbox style you can do what ever you want if you like to play with other people you can join someones squad or start your own quality of playing with squad depend on 75 leader and 25 member in my opinion you can go solo and still be part of large battle take potshot at the fringe or even infiltrate enemy basis and cause havoc there planetside 2 be free to play so you can use real money to buy stuff however everything that actually affect gameplay can be unlock by play within reasonable amount of time you can trial any weapon for 1h per day most weapon be sidegrade and most stock weapon be actually quite good have large arsenal mean that you can tackle wide variety of situation i would say ps2 be pay for convenience and pay for bling this be a great incentive to actually buy their stuff and support the continued existence of planetside 2,pos
early access reviewgood game a little bug in cliff and mountains ak 47s dissapear on the ground can not change hair colour and no eu server it have much to improve and very similar to pubg mobile,pos
early access reviewmaybe no for now well i be a fan of aqw and i get excited when i hear that ae will go to create a 3d version this game be not bad at all the only problem for me be the control when i move my mouse to move the camera to the side its also zoom in at the same time i hope that the next update will fix that problem overall not bad at all for a classic mmorpg,neg
be with elsword since 2012 the game now be basically a chore if you be into pvp or want to do the end game dungeon properly because it will take you week if not month to grind up decent level gear just for the dungeon pvp be no well now that the character balance be super wack because you now have 11 character with their own weakness and strength some with more strength either a character spamme you with magic skill x or that super fast flying character against a character that can not even double jump pro fun story cute and amazing character and graphic community be pretty good if you get pass some of the salt dungeon be fun like 10 character slot so you can try basically all the character if you want good time killer con you will get into routine of log on for an hour or two to do the daily quest and log off until you can actually enjoy the game properly unbalanced pvp and weapon balance microtransaction to restore gear once break limited edition costume and mount not require but a bit too pricey after a while very repetitive after you make 3 more character to level 99,neg
early access reviewit be a grind game not a wwii game there be wwii era content everything hide under a paywall or an awful grind or both the grind be so preposterous that it make world of tank and war thunder feel light on the grind aspect for your sanity do not play it or you will wish you have your waste hour back i know i wish i have my 9 hour back,neg
i have a love hate relationship with this game although it be free ish be an old starfox veteran i get on well with the arcadey action in the early game out manoeuvre enemy and chop their wing off with the target lead system each nation have a different set of plane each with their own strength and weakness although these do not matter too much at this early stage needless to say the bi plane stage be great fun then gradually i progress into the mid war era of aircraft this be fun too for a while but then i start to notice a change in the play style of my team mate and my opponent instead of roll away from each other to engage in a dogfight my opponent would just fly straight towards my plane gun blaze then plough straight through me like a batter ram killing both of us with no point score either side get use to these head on collision they happen a lot and not just with enemy sometimes you will be chase a plane only to find that a cloud of friendly player have form around you fixate on the same target try to nab the kill before you do because of this tunnel vision eventually a team mate will collide with you then call you a f king rammer n00b for your trouble lovely my main problem with this outcome be that there be very little penalty to prevent it on either side so the conflict just develop into a war of attrition to see which side have buy the most plane to aimlessly throw into the meat grinder alternatively you will get lock in a dogfight with a superior plane usually a spitfire with its well turning circle and no friend will be around to get it off your tail because 10 of them will be chase 1 bomber and crash into each other and yell expletive in the chat box i get the impression that the game want me to spend money to buy super upgrade for my plane to make them pointlessly unbeatable like in world of tank or create a squadron of other people who enjoy get ram by their team mate however my review system be base off the capacity enjoy a game even if you be a friendless hobo so if you be look for some quick arcade dogfighting action this game be one for you however if you be a fan of aviation look for a dedicated team base stress buster you will find this game utterly infuriating they will eventually add tank and ship into the mix but until then i be not convinced sorry warthunder you only get 4 10 golden badger egg,neg
this be so bull i start play 2 day ago and i love it i really do and i get my computer for several certain game and this be one of them and they make it really sad because i be really hope that i could 1 day get a hat from a random drop but no that dosent exist anymore and the matchmaking be complete shyt i have not be able to get into a single match and they make it like a moba if you leave you get penalize and that be complete bullshyt so you know what you valve you have take a amazing game and throw it away ok because i would rather spend 100 upgrade my computer so i can play overwatch than play this piece of shyt ok because you need to pull your head out of your ass and start compete with overwatch ok and you have the potential ok but its to late the damage be do you just lose so many peole within a hour of this update release ok so if you fix these thing i may play again but you be so frustrating you never listen to anyone why be this here be the thing you fuqed up and i do not think it will come back and what s sad be that i finally be get good with spy and scout but you ruin it ok and i do not think i can forgive you guy for it this game be amazing and you manage to ruin it i i be just really disapointed you need to think before you do ok and start listen to your fan or you be go to lose alot of them this game be fill with amazing people and you let alot of them down just please start listen and be more mindfull of the thing your fan want honestly t t,neg

notepreviously i have write a review of this game which be severely negative and be base on other negative review i do not bother play the game at first due to be unable to connect to any world and it turn out that the problem be from my isp i have to use a vpn to be able to play the game otherwise i would be spamme with connection time out also what be the deal with some people state that the shop be annoy nothing happen with me additionally this game be not pay to win at least so far i have not see anything that make you win i be still new to this game so this review be definitely go to be update in the near future creativerse and minecraftlet me just clear up one thing many people here compare this game to minecraft and think that this game be a clone of it well it be not heres why minecraft be a voxel base game and so be creativerse however many of the core element between creativerse and minecraft be completely different and irrelevant to each other if this game feature pickaxe and mob such as skeleton and zombie then you can say it be try to copy minecraft but it do not an example of a minecraft clone would be minetest that be clearly a minecraft clone both game vary in play style even when they be both base on the same concept compare minecraft to creativerse be like compare apple an orange classic example stop call it a minecraft clone moron the review creativerse be a voxel base survival game with good lighting animation water effect as well as toon graphic every new player that first look at this game judge immediately that this game be similar to minecraft and it be note the difference between clone and similar the game be fully online and as such nothing be store in your computer as you first enter this game you will be immediately assign a world that be store online and not in your computer what be lovely be that you can allow other player to join your world and you can also join other people world i be go to review the ui play style and some element of the game i find intriguing note that i just start play this game and already i be start to see how wrong i be when i first make that terrible review user interfacethe user interface be pretty compare to many game the developer put some effort into make everything pretty and nice to look at everything be well organized craft interface be neat and the craft system be simple but it can be easy to get lose in thankfully there be a search option play styleplay style of the game be unique each player start with a touchstone that could be use to teleport an infinite amount of time and other player can also teleport to them rather than use your traditional crafting table to create other item you need to craft a processor that process your material into other material ore in this game require to be mine use a device call an ore extractor rather than use the mining device when you run and stop you do not stop immediately you slightly slide forward combat be tough and tricky even pig attack you and land a hit without get hurt be difficult but possible element of the game i like blueprintsi love the blueprint but what i do not like be that only the developer can supply blueprint but other player can not hopefully in the future player would be able to share their own creation for other to build out of,pos

i say other game like dota allstars dota2 and hero of the storm that i have play be all great game and deserve 9 10 and other dota like game that i do not mention be just shadow by dota2 but they be not as action pack be not as visually polish as smite their ranged attack can not be dodge or block their combat field lane jungle be smaller more crowded with incommensurately large model of character and spell their hero have eye in the back of their head for example i think dota2s artwork be great the other day i room in and find out a man be almost as high as a tree and the landscape be just non existent i be so disappointed that i suddenly find out i be just not play an aaa game for the action pack juking and vision part go google smite top 5 play cast by inuki and one will feel the thrill that other mouse click dota will not give just remember when one dash forward in smite he she will see everything move backward and will have effective vision field shrink compare to the more boring 360 degree vision field of most other dota games one only have part of 720 degree in smite i say other popular dota like game be great but the comparison be cruel so either 6 10 to them and 9 10 to smite or if one can not accept they be 6 then 9 10 to them and 15 10 to smite deal with it,pos
this game although be around a very cube like style like other game minecraft cube world etc be atleast 85 different and unique in it be own way here be some pro and con pro there be many class to choose from range from a fly fairy like woman to a barbarian that wear and use candy as a weapon there be an rpg aspect to the game have to mainly break through dungeon and beat boss to earn loot you can also goto a city of neon light and ask around for quest from different creature around the city to earn point and thing you can use in some shop to buy item endless fun this game have so many thing to do in it that it be to the point of almost endless gameplay there be so many class to level up there be mastery point which can be earn to get a mastery rank which can get you cool prize there be club world you can make to hang out with friend or build there be hundred of style of clothing and costume for your character and so much more i can not even start to explain everything not 100 pay to win there be alot of thing that you can buy easily but can craft in game with just more difficulty con some thing be a little too pricy and can not be craft in the game have to spend money on game if you want to get something fast etc make progress start off easy and then become extremely hard make a learning curve that exponentially increase but sudden decrease at high rate make you want to quit the game and not come back for awhile option have no graphic setting make it hard for slow computered people to even play even while use a good pc or a good ps4 this game still lag a ton and can be quite annoying cool thing take extremely notice i say extremely long to get if you do not want to pay for it,pos

go big or go home poe be at its core all about rng rng loot drop be the core game mechanic as one person put it fight loot find monster the game have plenty to recommend it great graphic inspiring sound music a deep meta game whereby the number of possible character build be nearly endless great customisation and the good mtx system i have yet see in a game where 95 of all item that can be purchase with real money be purely cosmetic in nature the other 5 be quality of life item that do not in any way make poe pay to win this be how all game company should do microtransaction my problem with poe be that the nature of the rng system mean that actually useful item be incredibly rare the entire game economy appear to be design with the 1 twitch broadcaster in mind who play thousand of hour of poe nothing else that be fine but it essentially lock an actually significant amount of the game content behind difficulty wall that can only be breach by spend huge amount of time play if like me you have very limited gaming time between real life stuff work family etc then i would seriously recommend that you will likely only find frustration in this game and you should look elsewhere my 500 hour at the time of writing have be accumulate over the past 5 year if you be willing to put in the time the sheer range of possibility that poe offer and the deep meta game be very rewarding and for these player poe be the good arpg available if however you have limit gaming time or play casually then do not bother you be not the target audience for this game unfortunately would i recommend poe yes but only because i enjoy play with my friend this be not a game that i play solo because the sheer size of the mindless grind to get the good gear be frankly unbelievably boring,pos

access reviewi know this game be go to suck but jesus christ i be a bit nostalgic about play the original flash adventure quest back when i be like 10 and i guess i should have just leave this series if you can even call it in the past as a distant fond memory distort by the nostalgia goggle of a 10 year old me that have never actually play many video game aside from ape escape which actually hold up way better at that point in my life about 10 minute in i have to stop because there be nothing to be find in this game but poorly waste time waste your time on something else a single looping track that can fit into any fantasy rpg with the embarassing budget of a public school art program just repeat again and again it be painful i can not fathom anyone spend real world money on the loot box and micro transaction yes it be one of those game it be okay to go vomit,neg

on my experience with this game i try the game around 2 year ago i think at first i find it very overwhelming to understand the mechanic of the game such as skill gem support gem equipment socket and link for the gem currency what to do with the currency craft trading etc as this be one of the first game that i have ever play that be like this and so i do not really try to understand it and just play it and try to beat the game it be fun ofcourse until i progress further through the game the game content get more and more difficult and because with the lack of knowledge that i have on the game i suck lol and yep i give up after a few day of play thennn after a year or two i start to give it another try and actually take my time to understand the mecahnic and i start research about thing that i do not really understand after with some knowledge about the game mechanic and such i actually get well and i get really into the game and since then it have be my favourite game and it be be the game that i play the most hehe but yeah overall in the begining it be overwhelming because of the amount of information and mechanic of the game but that be what make the game noice a lot of thing to do in the game a lot for the newbie out there if you suck like me research character class build really help me alot and also try to understand the game content really help too it may take time tho only if you suck,pos

the game be fairly buggy but the developer appear to be work quickly to resolve them the game also try to solve the issue that the original monopoly have feature in the game allow for a quick game limit it to 15 minute maximum and the revised chance card can allow you to free up already claim property prevent stalemate that last hour 7 10 need work but be definitely worth give a try,pos
this game be disgustingly unbalanced unless you be play the germans or russians you have no chance the ally tank be garbage and useless you can be penetrate from any angle while you have to hit a small specific area on the german and russian tank to penetrate they say its realistic but why do not the ally have 40 tank a match and the germans have 10 maybe if you be a pro you may be able to have a good time but for casual or new player its,neg
when you get past the obvious asset it be basically a management game a simple but good one at that there be some cosmetic dlc in the game but nothing noticeable other than that it be free of the free to play trash that often litter these game i highly recommend it,pos
early access reviewby far the good horror game i have ever play totally worth what ever they will make it it start with a really cutsy feel then boom blood and gore it be amazing 10 10 only problem you glitch in the wall when you run into them bad for the puppeteer and the mouse sensetivity be very low hard to look around,pos
summary this game be imo the good of its kind the late free mini expansion for path of exile release later today so it seem like a good time for me to recommend it on the face of it this game be your standard diablo clone but even though it be not as flashy as diablo 3 its depth customisation and replayability ultimately make it rise above the competition the combat be fun and challenge the game have a slow start though that be one of the issue be address in todays expansion but once the combination of skill and variety of environment become apparent it really come into its own the skill tree be huge really absolutely massive and offer countless build customisation option which be in complete contrast to e g diablo 3 you can combine skill gem to give your skill different effect sort of like rune in d3 but much deep i enjoy the loot and itemisation much more than other game in the genre too because of the possibility of craft and improve any trash item that drop the replayability be fantastic new challenge league be launch every few month which offer the option of an economy reset and always change the game in interesting way they also usually adjust the balance of the game it can be a bit flavour of the month ish regularly which mean that different build be enticing and since build play very differently this also help replayability then there be race short and challenging event of between 12 min and three hour which offer a unique challenge and a nice way to get into competitive online gaming in a non pvp setting race season run for six week or so every few month with several event per day and unique reward poe be free to play but never pay to win it have one of the good business model of any f2p game microtransaction be cosmetic or functional e g visual skill effect stash tab and the base offering be among the most generous i have see in a f2p game poe dev be responsive and down to earth and regularly interact with player on reddit and the forum give them your money there be also plenty of little thing e g the game take on health mana flask which be so obviously well than the implementation in other game in the genre that it be very hard to go back to the impoverished version of those feature in other game there be still thing that need improve the trade system need work for instance and desync can be a problem in certain circumstance but these be only small negative compare to the positive,pos

seriously i love this game it be really fun but all this game be an argument to spend a lot of money for a compagny what a shame could be fun if the game design be not all about money i sum up money could be spend to have some game coin and this coin could be use to buy some weapon or other good stuff when you begin the game you think that it be possible to play the game without spend any money but it be not if you do not buy you can not defeat powerfull monster and the only weapon you could find on the game for free be bad compare to them so after the level max 20 you die you do not have a choice yeah die again and again and be stick quikly without see a lot of the fun of rotmd or pay and play the real game a false free game do not fall on the trap,neg
early access reviewso i have be play a bit more recently and it have get well since i have last play about 6 month ago but only marginally this have make me want to change my negative review to positive that be how good it have get i have just unlock the sherman bad thing about it he and apcr apcr be a necessity you can not play tank without it take a while to unlock and be have a bit of fun with it as i be write a positive review i decide i should see how it be with a new character so i decide to pull a raw recruit for germany and i will say how fun that be so i start off do the tutorial for the quick level and first blood badge as i have do when i be actually first start off i then hop into a match and it be decent nothing amazing the next match be not so good the third match be abhorrent i come up against ppshs ppss and ppds with nothing more than a stock gewher 43 i be mow down in second flat in close range and in medium or long range i could not hit anything mostly due to not have the ability to hold my breath i have just get grenade so that be alright but my gewher could do nothing to combat the automatic smgs rifle and machine gun that almost every enemy have and thus i decide to change my review to negative so here be some pro and con pro look decent not amazing but decent very active player basecon everything be expensive you do not make much money next to nothing when start off garbage starting gear can not compete with anyone else long grind between level to level spawn camping be still a thing despite dev try to get rid of it spawn protection exploit airplane can damage tank with ap mgs strafe with he mgs and wreck everything with bomb all on the same plane infantry have a meriad of way to destroy tank back capper arebr para excessive pandering towards long time veteran player who basically already have everything grind be essentially the pay wall pay up now or face the grind yes i mostly pull tank,neg
truly this game be the absolute bottom of the barrel in term of idle clicker game i will start by say this the game mechanic be fun and the game itself be enjoyable the team format be unique and diverse that be say this game represent all of the unbridled greed that game developer seem to find themselves fill with these day in term of raw micro transaction cost this game be the most expensive game on the market in addition this game have be out for quite some time on kongregate com prior to be release on steam as a game developer i find kongregate to be a great community and i have enjoy see other title such as adventure capitalist time clicker and clicker hero make amazing transition over to the steam community the same can not be say for this game why all the aforementioned title all have one thing in common if you spend money on in game micro transaction on kongregate all of those bonus carry over to the steam platform player be give the ability to export their save game code and then import it once on steam even for idle clicker game that be only on kongregate this be common practice at this point it have become an expect good practice within the industry crusader of the lost idol do not do this kongregate user have be call for age for the ability to import export save code even more so once it be announce that this title would be be release on steam user repeatedly reach out to the developer attempt to make contact with them the dev be silent for over 4 month finally one day the dev decide to finally appease the masse and actually engage themselves with their community that be when we all discover the awful truth the dev be simply try to rob their player the developer announce they be make the concious choice to refuse datum transfer to player in their community who spend real money on in game bonus spend 50 on chest when the game be first release on kongregate only well you do not get to keep those bonus better spend another 50 if you want all your perk again eh while i have not ever spend money on this game and have thus not lose out due to this i find this to be one of the most unethical decision i have see a non ea blizzard game developer make it undermine the entire indie community despite the fun gameplay due to the underhandedness of the developer i would advise everyone to avoid this game and not support it heck since it be free to play install it then downvote it with a review player and consumer in general need to take a stand against greedy developer like code name,neg
early access reviewfractured space have be a really fun experience for me so far the game play like a moba in space and have excellent ship and control mechanisims vertical and horizontal strafe in addition to standard control the objective base gameplay be in my opinion much more satisfying than a simple deathmatch set with the game now free to play i would highly recommend try it out make sure to try the tutorial and you can check the fractured space youtube for ship guide on the starter ship to help you get start,pos

so i play this game back when you pay for it once and then play it be good the environment be not complex but it have enough in it to make ship position interesting and strategically relevant there be just a handful of ship to choose from and they be distinctly different from each other both visually and functionally the community of player be pretty fun to play with too now the game be free but actually not the current total cost of all dlc be 179 96 the game be not good jump from one tiny box to another make everything feel cramped and more congested than before fly now feel like drive in los angeles ship positioning be mostly irrelevant because there be very few long sight line leave the ship design have get lazy and it be hard to tell one conglomeration of plate and girder from another anymore and the player community well read the other negative review most of which be well think out and write by experienced player and then read the comment on them the people who attack the writer of those review personally instead of read and respond to the criticism that be the current player base it be like play with all the people you know and love from youtube comment the recent update be a pretty naked cash grab and do not make the gameplay better than it be pay to win and lootboxe this sort of thing be so disgusting it should result in developer be ostracize by the game community at large ea would probably give you a medal though maybe if you be hurt for money you could sell out to them i be sure you all would get along famously,neg

  i have decide to get back into realm once again through the web client version and it be a very exciting game so i have decide to come back from my extremely old review with no reason to recommend and have completely rework and rewrite the review with constant imaginative enemy fight you range from cute but deadly bunny to oryx the mad god himself this game be a bullet hell and god damn be it a crazy bullet hell missile fly in every direction imaginable enemy release missile in every direction add the challenge to rotmg as you really have to learn how to use the control effectively before be able to imagine the high level but those high level be extremely rewarding if you reach so it be absolutely worth the time do dungeon there be a natural annoyance with the business model it have very expensive package be sell which can be buy with the in game pay currency gold or just money with just the beginner package be sell for 20 for a new account and 60 after however none of the package in rotmg actually need to be buy you can achieve the same as anyone else without pay it be hard yes but it be not like it be quick if you pay it be just easy if you do overall i would recommend this game from the point of view that it be f2p so you be not waste anything by buy it,pos
a free to play game with seasonal update decent lore and detailed game mechanic so much so that you may need to consult forum guide every now and then also fan site like poe planner and poe trade be very useful for gameplay that say the longer you play and the more time you invest into this game the more likely you will buy microtransaction to expand your stash fancy up your exile outfit and more pretty decor for your hideout however i think it be a fair trade consider again this game be free and none of the microtransaction you purchase have any significant bearing on actual game play a balance that big aaa publisher with much large budget do not seem to understand my one gripe at time of review be that exile voice acting and npc dialogue unique to each of the exile class be absent from the fall of oriath onwards it be those little detail of immersion that make the game more fun to play yknow,pos
good game that be ruin by a very expensive price model always online requirement and technical problem i really enjoy r3e during its free weekend good selection of car track good number of option for set up race against ai nice graphic sound good controller support however the game have some serious issue always online requirement suck content be very expensive compare to every other racing sim out there the full package be very expensive and buy select car track be even more expensive that combine with the always online requirement discourage me from ever spend money on content for this game technical problem sometimes the game will not start server issue update issue the infamous content server error 20004 that can take 30 minute several steam restart to fix it could have be a great game but the issue mention totally ruin the experience and i do not see any reason to buy any of the overly expensive content,neg

early access reviewyou have to remember just how early in development the game be before you complain about lack of content amongst several other thing this developer always release game very early in order for player to send suggestion as to form the game in to what people will enjoy through the little time i have so far play there be a lot of repetition and such very basic quest you may be ask to kill a specific enemy enough time for example only for the next quest to be kill the same enemy for item drop many many thing be still in very early development here and its very easy to tell however for say how early it be what be already here be great the scenery be very pleasing to look at enemy model look good and the animation be very smooth for both enemy and player model if you want to really enjoy an in depth mmo with many feature wait a while then pick this up if however you want to see a game evolve over time and see everything from the very beggining download it see it for yourself and make your own judgement its free anyway so there s a big bonus,pos

early access reviewthe game be a lot well back in 2014 but the development team be amatuer at good failure to learn from their mistake and there be many which have be prove again and again over the 2 year of update i have suffer play this game match making be appaulle and punish new player and skllled player the outcome of most game be decide before you start the match which be such poor game design the problem arise when they lose most of their player with an update back in 2015 battle arena update which break the game overclocke mechanic and reduce the playerbase to a point they start throw everyone together to speed up the queue time the removal of tier be never replace by a well system just the same system with more spread on the player it match together this relate to the poor match make mega bot be add then remove when they lose interest in develop them mega weapon be keep and now present a game balance issue the developer lask the skill to resolve failure to add key feature for the community like clan this could make the game if they bother to implement it they treat the player customer with little consideration when they release major change often these be fill with new bug and design flaw they only care about new player who spend real money membership exist but it offer such poor value i suspect a small than normal percentage of the playerbase have take up the offer if you spend real money on this game be warn anything you buy could be change from the point of purchase as they change the mechanic of this game at least once a year spend only to support the development team who endless change thing and keep the game in alpha development to excuse them from any real accountibility the most recent update change the ingame economy to be primary control by open crate which contain a random item the item can be convert into ingame currency for a fraction of its price effectively you can grind the free to play model convert the item into currency and progress at a very slow rate or buy the new crate item for real money at extortionate rate they have realise only new player spend money on their game so this model maximise what a new player need to spend if they actually what to compete in the game match against the vetern player this game be now look more like free to install and pay to compete,neg

early access reviewearly access and probably alpha note that about this review this game need alot of fix and add if its go to be worth anything however i will give an easy setup of good and bad part of this so far positive good space mechanic it feel like you be fly a massive ship in space which be good cause its a space combat sim ship and critical point there be ship class that be somewhat ballanced some unfair look at the cloak and short range 1 hit kill switch one but it all make it well when you can damage part of ship and take even moar damage combat combat be slow yet fast its like i have say it feeeeel like a space game that you see in homeworld and typical space game sci fi games cannon take time to turn and same do the ship its like star conflict do more realistic negative part cloak and short range weapon probably the most broken ship in the game do not remember the name of the ship assault i think but you know what you be it be stupid compare to the sniper class this ship be break and either need a huge nerf or be terminate the game outside graphic and game mechanic apparently from what i see its go to be a mmo pvp moba ish game it also have a cheap version of star conflict with the lobby from what i see there will be only online gaming with this game and no pve gamemode capture the enemy headquarters oooooooooh that s boring that be the only gamemode at this point ooooooh that be bore there be really not much to say about this game cause there be almost nothing in this its not a bad game just feel the dev be hold it back alot they could have add deathmatch team deathmatch or anything else to make it more fun or even have more variant that be not so straight out of the class system book of any mmo rpg game owell i suggest not buy the game yet maybe later only time will tell go to give it a thumb up cause the dev to see that they can do it,pos
early access reviewif you be browse in recent review do not bother with this game i will not even mention stuff like mana system because some people hate it some people love it rather it be a prime example of pay 2 win model do not trust old review say it be not it be not always like this i have to admit i play it a bit during it be early open beta it be harsh but a determined player could eventually afford a deck or two in the day when there be only the base set now there be a basic set and 3 other set with 250 ish card each common and uncommon be easy to get but every pack yield only 1 rare very rarely a legendary you will get a few pack at the start and you will get a pack from a late set as a daily reward but there be lot of card you will need keep in mind 1k card pool and if you think you will be able to craft legendarie i have some very bad news for you common card dust for 1 shard and a legendary cost 3200 and you can have up to four copy of them new player may think this game be generous i mean you even get some paltry sum of gold and a common from every bronze chest you open this flood feel like you make a progress but the truth be your progress be equal to the amount of legendarie you own you may ask why do you need legendarie can not you use common instead well legendarie have one of two thing they either have a unique game win tier ability no common have or they be just a stat powerhouse or a mix of both to give you an example a common 4 cost in yellow have stat of 3 4 and 1 minor skill the legendary 4 cost be 5 6 it have 1 minor skill 1 unique skill no other common have to sum up you will never catch up to old player who play every day since early beta or donator i have to admit the game mechanic and card variety be pretty decent too bad all you can do be drool at the craft screen if you have a spare 500 to throw at the game feel free to try it if not then stay away i hope i will save your time,neg

this be the only game i have a bad internet connection on even on dota 2 i have a well internet connection than this furthermore your if your opponent pay to win your opponent can trigger off 5 effect in one turn all because you play 1 card or because your opponent just go first i be sick and tired of people summon blue eye white dragon turn 2 3 and 4 turn 5 whatever i should lucky no one can summon blue eye white dragon on turn 1 yet and attack this game have so much power creep it be go to need to constantly come out with more broken card blue eye white dragon net decker be the least of my worry i have far big fish to fry with the other deck the rose dragon deck how the game in many way discourage you from come up with creative and different deck type but rather heavily push you into an arch type build now bare in mind i have be win most of the time but win and lose be not the issue i have as well lose a bunch of match when i do not figure out how to trigger the tuner type ability for the monster it be not fun when my opponent play off 5 effect and i be just sit on my hand or have enough time to make a sandwhich and casually stroll on back wait for my opponent to be do with their turn and i wish i be joke about that but i be not gem be insanely easy to get i would say and i be able to get more gem than the beginning but again that be because i be kind of be a jerk on the match if i be go against someone from mexico or some palce i figure that they would not have good internet i would stall my turn until their internet connection cut out long enough for me to get the win that because of this and how many player from mexico and russia i be get i be able to keep bump myself up the rank slowly and bump up my level faster and faster and faster i think it take me less than a couple hour to get to lv 10 with yugi as well for some reason a lo tof the player i face from player with bad itnernet connection that they often do not have good card or at least the one i have be face i do feel bad for them but by all mean that be not the main problem the main problem be how the pacing be ruin by certian deck i could just farm from a bunch of player with low internet connection and just net deck like everyone else because i literaly keep run into deck after net deck and that be not fun because i like to see creative and different tactic and strat sure i be use the same strat but that be because i do not have any good card the tactic i go with 1 if i can summon 2 monster at turn 1 1 1 synchro summon and get 2300 atk dragon mosnter out1 2 if the monster get destroy i would just bring it back with 1 of 2 spell card i had2 if i could not then i would keep up my power3 go for raw power4 dig through my opponent graveyard5 send something to the graveyard5 1 then dig through the graveyard6 set up combo on my trap and monster to work well off of each other now i do not then those tactic be bad at all if anything they be the good thing i could come up with for all the card i have get the reason why be because i do not want to arch type focus but the only way to win at this game be to arch type focus which suck by all mean could we stop this hyper focus on arch type how be it fun to be restrict like this what be the point of experiment if it be basically punish i understand that the game start it be arch type focus because we get to have money but i mean really it get silly at a certian point this be just go to get bad and bad at this rate,neg

okay my take on this game after read several hundred neg review about this game i decide to give its shot f2p after all my story begin and end within 5 second then bambi kill after the hulk mode run out instead of respawne i be boot to the main menu where now i can no longer connect to any server after check online for a fix to the game destroy bug the only help i find be to create a new window user then log in with that game delete and in future ill listen to the masse this game do not bother waste your bandwidth its really not worth it,neg
early access reviewthis game be bad than actual garbage a majority of the weapon do not do anything at all and you be well off run with a knife around the map the hit box be so ed that you walk over people there be 1 weapon worth buy in this whole game the asval if you buy anything else you be e disabled i would not recommend this game to anyone unless you be 12 and you be not brave enough to steal your mom credit card to buy counter strike the game be just a plain rip off of it one of the map be literally a section of a dust 2 and the dev be so e lazy they just say it and close b hall off and make a tdm map,neg
early access reviewi will keep this review brief i grow up with adventurequest the nostalgia value be certainly here in abundance the way it have be revisione from a 2d microsoft paint esque visual to a full scale 3d mmorpg be actually my favorite part about the game there be a lot of good thing about this game despite its early access state open beta there be also a lot that could be improve and even a few thing that need to be scrap first as a mobile game it be actually awesome play pretty well on my nexus 6p battery drain be surprisingly low and there be flexible graphic setting could be improve combat and gameplay be fun on mobile not as much on pc the cross platform do have its convenience though story be pretty standard ae it do not blow your mind but the humor be entertain for some to most a lot of the character particularly the one who have have time over the year to be flesh out and build around the ae staff they be base on be relatable and good character overall do not get too far into aqworlds so i can not speak as to how well they write villain these day from what i have see in what the story offer currently it be not so bad one of the first character i actually pay attention to and like get kill immediately and be probably the only character that will happen to it 100 need a book of lore like what aqw have it be hard even for veteran player to keep up on whether or not thing be complete thing be pretty ambiguous and the main story be a bit disjointed once you finish a zone a book of lore would fix all of that and give the developer a guide for future content in relation to player progression and main story cohesion progression need a lot of work class have no depth beyond what ability you immediately get when switch to them for some it be enough but there be definitely room for more character choice and gameplay option here skill tree ability upgrade passive etc what i miss from other ae game that i do not get from this one be actually progress in your class and earn rank title and ability i do hope they add it even if people will gripe about more thing to grind on that note gear could use some work too for one a character profile or equipment page inventory management especially with equipment be messy it need a page that show each slot and any equipped cosmetic would be nice if that all do not take up inventory space too gear stat need more depth and relevance i would like personal player stat we can choose to upgrade like classic aq but equipment just provide basic attack armor crit haste evasion etc be just boring i get that they want people to just switch between class at their discretion it be a fine idea if implement well but this way be just too simple and take away from player choice and meaningful gear grind if that be a thing that go into my last major critique which be the ui on pc some of the element have weird scaling on mobile screen space be hard to manage in any game but this one could use some work the inventory be mostly a big mess and it would be nice if the chat window and health bar be locate somewhere else although i can understand how frustrating it must be if any developer read this i would suggest have some ui option available for people as every mobile device be different aq3ds kickstarter page nail the main point it be a game that have a lot of potential it be not even close to live up to it though that be not to say it be a bad game just that it have so much room to grow in a market completely oversaturate with copy paste asian mmorpg especially on mobile this could be the game that topple it all and i hope it be i would recommend personally if only because i have actually be really enjoy my time with it on my phone i be really excited to see what they add later on especially if they take the time to gather feedback and update class accord to it if you do not grow up with ae they be the type of developer to literally put themselves into their game i have meet their npc and actual character dozen of time in game be transparent about their plan and shortcoming and keep push out content they seem to be spread a bit thin with how many game they have it would be a tough call to pull the plug on old game but i understand they be focus heavily on aq3d anyway it be certainly far from a perfect game even a great game but it be a great time killer on mobile and be like any ae game very social some of the negative review i have see be not totally fair i would just check it out on your phone if it seem interesting to you and make up your own mind like i do if you grow up with aq definitely try it out i will recommend this even in its rough incomplete stage because while it be fun and succeed in some way it have a long way to go and every bit of feedback help ae and i know they factor it all in,pos

early access reviewok i be fully aware about what have be say negatively about this game however this game be do what any great game have it be try to bring more people in and it give a more easy system for some area where even i be still learn and i have play this game for about 2 year on and off if you count the first year make three but this game whilst have flaw like have all those nice and sweet vehicle that you have to buy to get these vehicle however can be take down with be smart and use smart tactic the new tech tree system be a bit of odd one for them to implement however it do have its use so that it make the whole gameplay more faster i be grind through match to have enough tech point for material and whilst some may say that there be less amount of credit give out i have earn more throughout match then i have ever before overall this game be amazing with the amount of creativity that will satisfy the most outlandish new word i think d of idea and thinker this game have have its up and down but it be still a great game as long as you apply some knowledge to it as to counter one of these new vehicle that someone pay over 12 for i hope the developer can see what their community put out as to keep this game run overall,pos
game have a great idea but you know what i have not have much of a chance to play the game why you may ask well its because i could never get in a game i would set for 10 15 minute with a other player in the que and never find a game,neg
ever since the last halloween event the game be become less and less enjoyable the bad part be the meet your match update you can no longer just join steam friend unless ask them and wait for them to finish game match last like 5 10 minute and your team either get destroy or you be destroy the other team very rarely there be a balanced match whoever enjoy competitive gameplay will enjoy this but whoever just want to spend like 30 minute of spare time it would not be such a good experience valve become too lazy to update anything or should i say the number of people work on anything relate to the game bug fix update decrease dramatically that definitely decrease the quality of the update they be even too lazy to modify the last major update we have on the store page which stay tough break now release almost a year ago event like scream fortress be really enjoyable in past year because valve always add something new for the past 2 year they rely only on the community to create a few map and that be everything new about the event for the time be i can not recommend this game to newcomer,neg
early access reviewya know its a great game when you have a freind its even better when your team know how to play together but not in a mob make thing hard when your holding off the left flank alone so the enemy do not completely overun the base in 5 minute and yet i kill more then my share punch a few hole in some other guy and yet i be the one who seem to be place at the bottom of the leaderboard when i deal the most damage seriously make me angry that i get nada for exp when i stop an onslaught make me wonder how bad this will be in the long run,pos
early access reviewthis be a great game and its just in alpha that s how i be start this review it be playable there be a tutorial that be very helpful and explain and well actually do what a tutorial be suppoe to do teach you how to play also you unlock a ship and some experiance and credit booster experiance to rank up your account the rank seem to all be captain something so far starfleet captain or expedition captain and such credit to buy new crew member or ship or ship upgrade there be 3 ship manufacture with multiple ship to buy from witch all do have unique gun and ability crew member your limit to only 5 and they do greatly effect your ship you do start off with some but hire more to gain just what you need to make your select ship really shine all these thing effect damage utility and defence of your ship make a load out of what you want ship and ship gun and ability and crew wise and launch from hanger into as of now in alpha conquest game capture point and as a team lv up and upgrade your ship to take the enemy base its a fairly simply game to understand and play but master it and really own the void with your behomoth titen of a ship be go to take some time and experience grab this game asap if your all for space battle oh and the music be space void like and remind me of the alein movie and everytime i get hit by some missile i imagine my crew be rock around and explosion like in the old star trek,pos

early access reviewthe s s i have to say for a 20 mb free download it be pretty good music combat and ui be understandably underwhelming but all the usual mmo function be there the game personality be where it come alive it be whimsical and humerus albeit cheesy at time and in an industry so over saturate with copy cat game it be refreshing to see developer showcase some artistic freedom and inspiration play with friend and escape the grind by find easter egg reference and goof around i play a female sport a guy fawkes mustache and meet 3 banker name edgar allan and poe it be a blast,pos
i think the dev do some research on object that can scare human you may not like the style of the graphic but this game be the creepy horror game i have ever play all of the sound effect can scare you especially the cardboard in different level different monster will chase you which make the game more and more creepy therefore ignore the style of graphic and download the game i be sure you will not regret try it although you may regret try it because it be very scary game for all horror lover download it now tip if you be too scared turn off speaker and play,pos

absolutely love this game i be a huge yu gi oh fan so this review may be a little skewed for some people that have never watch or play any of yu gi oh but i grow up with yu gi oh and i absolutely love every second of it they have change some thing like make the row small 3 instead of 5 but it do not hurt the game in anyway i grow up with the original series of game movie and the tv show with yugi joey and kaiba just to name a few so any of the gx and so on i do not watch unfortunately but they be a welcome addition since they bring all the card from all the series which i really enjoy yes let deal with the elephant in the room this be a mobile port do not run away just yet i use to play this game for a bit on my phone but could never get into it since the screen be too small for what be on screen a bit too clunky as well but this port on steam be where this game really shine it run super smooth and the screen size be alot well and of course the mouse keyboard be always well than use a touchscreen they be also be no need to buy microtransaction unless you absolutely want too this game give you plenty of opportunity to earn item through match and they be always give away free stuff to player my rating for this game be a 10 10 this game be absolutely amazing and show how to do mobile port right one of the best free to play game on steam right now,pos
early access reviewit good consider its still in beta update i would like to point out a few thing aq3d be not for everyone its mostly for those who be young just want to play casual or want to spend ton of money i would give a negative review but ill be stick to positive the game be still in open beta so yes not much content in it yet future update and change will come along be it sooner or later i can still remember how aq mq df and aqw start out at 1st and its no different from aq3d start out too the dev be work hard so that no major problem come in the game like crash not load map miss item etc only major problem in the game be that some good item seasonal item that be only for cosmetic be costly but you be not oblige or require to pay or buy ok i mean the game will still grow you can get future content when you can afford to buy expensive stuff the grind to craft be tedious but be not it just similar to aqw to grind for reputation to get the cool item to grind item to get those nulgath item at the end of the day its only a game,pos

early access reviewso far the game mechanic be very similar to yet distinct from a mix of mtg and hearthstone i will say that the game flow much well and faster than either of those two and the rule be not as ambiguous nor as tedious to memorize as either of the other two as for eternal itself be able to mix and match element coherently be nice while not be constrain on character choice base on how my deck play be cool as well i have only so far complete the first chapter of the campaign and some of the battle in the second chapter and i be really excited to say that it feel like the kind of card game i could sink hour into and get a lot do in at the same time i would like to see what direwolf do in the future and more of the game before i offer any criticism or suggestion and thus far i have not encounter any bug in the game myself,pos

early access reviewi be very skeptical about this game when my friend be try to convince me to play as i be not a fan of battle royale style game normally i be quick to change my mind when i actually get into it with a group of friend and we be run a 4 man fireteam the map be large but there be many way to traverse it assume you take the time to plan to make the most of your form of transportation gunplay be intense as the game account for velocity and bullet drop with smgs and shotgun feel lethal in close combat while the dedicated sniper rifle if you can find a scope for them actually give you the ability to get kilometer standoff distance assume visibility be good the assault rifle cover the middle ground with some tend more to feel like smgs like the groza and m4 while other tend to be well at long range like the lvoa and akm the vehicle physics be absolutely legendary you can drive truck up 80 slope at 60kph and give the ridiculous terrain feature this be a huge plus and lead to some hilarious moment as well the graphic be good nothing exceptional but when you reach a mountain peak or be ride in the ski lift scatter around the map you be blow away by the fantastically design landscape the game be surprisingly optimize as well i be play on a laptop with a gtx1060 m and a 4th gen i7 and i be usually around 120 fp on the high setting even in intense firefight or the snowstorm that occur as a battle royale i give this game a 9 10 it be a simple game you grab gun you get attachment you follow the zone you kill the enemy team it do not do anything groundbreaking while at the same time have enough small change to the formula to make it stand out and actually be worth play with your buddy as a whole game experience 7 10 they supposedly have a pve mode come sometime next year as well and the pvp have give me enough of a reason to stick around to see where this go,pos
originally i would have write a positive review about this game i enjoy play this game with friend and in group but after a while this game just get extremely repetetive and boring and if you do not pay you will have to sit hour and hour xp farm just to progress in rank the microtransaction have ridiculously high price aswell and the developer be extremely greedy this be one of the bad pay to win game i have ever play and i would advise you to stay far away from this game you should rather give verdun or red orchestra a try they may not be as good as in tankmen airplane paratrooper etc but atleast they be not pay to win it be a huge mistake for me to return to pay to win game never again 1 10 terrible game,neg

early access reviewgaijin spyware malware agent and launcher should be block by default by any av software also make sure tol remove agent from your pc because that s t will stay on your pc in localappdata gaijin same apply for game it will most likely stay in your steam library where you instal it edit for dev who respond the only way to disable it would be with antivirus blocking start up why gaijin need 2 application 3 if we count in steam for a simple update i have no idea but agent run in background like a malware since task manager be the only place where you can see it run after close it and delete the game be fishy just because you can deactivate and close it do not mean it be not run sorry but that be not acceptable,neg
dcs world one of the good game i have play in a long time dcs simulate combat in a great way and offer a wide variety of thing to do though at the start you be lock with air to ground until you buy dlc you recive two start aircraft for free the tf p51 no armament and the su 25 t arm thankfully the 25 t although have a steep learning curve be still very easy to operate as certain dlc aircraft require week of practice to be able to fly and use effectivley steep learning curve and all i would highly reccomend this game as it maintain realism allow you to fly more modern arcraft which be not something super popular with multiplayer capable air combat game and be enjoyable no matter wat you be do,pos
after play this game for a while i have to say i have enjoy many hour of game play yes you can pay with a ton of cash it be not cheap to obtain the end game enchantnment and mount quicker but nothing that you can not get with spend some time grind out content the good possible thing for any new player come into the game would be to find a good guild this will save you ton of time money can not buy you skill i see 3 2 item player out dps and out play 4 3 player everyday if you like wow or mmos you will enjoy this game i suggest buy vip it be worth it for 10,pos

  i be take all those log they keep throw out and i be nail them together this game be quite possibly one of the most intense game i have play since cry of fear it keep on one edge while still be a rather simplistic concept get to the end if there even be an end its something that rely heavily on atmosphere and the psudo randomly generate map and variety of hazard and i feel with the additon of endless mode and extra room it will be well worth the time and extra chump change for this soon to be legend,pos
be look for a space battle game since i stop play battlestar galactica online and i think i have find it i have be play this game since alpha it be great fun though one of the reason i stop play be because the playerbase be drop hopefully now this game have a well player base now they have release the game 10 10looking forward to jump back in at some point,pos
before the most recent update i would have totally recommend this game to people but with the update come bad connection stability get disconnect nearly every game lead to unnecesary loss the game be good but if the server get sort it will be so much well for now it will get a thumb down,neg
early access review what a great game and its free too so do not complain about something that s free the graphic be much well than i expect and game play while small be intense and reasonably fun but that net code ohhh my god even play way out of region due to there be no oceania server developer need to add one the game netcode be awesome if only large franchise like ea and ubisoft could learn how to pay proper attention to this while it be still in early development i can see this be a long lasting game as long as they keep player number per match small,pos
early access reviewhaving play both the original and adventure quest world i can say that the developer at artix be off to a great start here you really have to appreciate that they can stick to their own style for as long as they have obviously at this point in development they have a lot of content to go before it can rival the previous game but i look forward to many year with aq3d,pos
04 05 2015short summary play russian or get rekt and you will get banhammere 100 if you say anything negative not even slander just some negative comment be enough on their forum or website typical russian attitude long summary could have be a good game but russian tank and plane be totally op who would have guess dev be russians do not bother start as any other faction than russian for russians the game surely be fun smack everyone and everything should they ever change that and balance the russian faction to be in line with the other i will change this review lol but i guess hell freeze over before that day edit on a second thought i guess this review will stay negative forever since some funny mod delete a thread of mine where i point out the massive ongoing bias during the current ww2 chronicels event background german facion be outnumber on every single match and have bad tier tank aswell which climax yesterday in a 8v12 sb and 10vs13 rb that s just super dumb it start on 10vs12 and be already hard but their beloved russians still lose some game so they change it to 8vs12 which completely crush german faction historical you say i would too but they do the same on ever single day of the event even during the poland invasion poland picture as soviets outnumber the germans 15v10 and it be unwinnable loloh and do i mention censor every issue whitch reflect their bad work on update or stuff where they create more imbalance than before on their forum and in the steam group be be almost immediately delete or lock and put in archive without any reason give if they would just communicate with the playerbase once they could have really easy solution for long lasting problem but they prefer not to get involve and banhammer everything instead just russian style day by day the same shit 16 07 2016tried an event t54 vs centurionin short british 3x 6 7 tank vs russian 7 3 7 7 8 0you may imagine the match be full off russian tank and nowhere a brit tank to be see but no russian bias right this be so big time bs have several faction unlock i can now draw direct conclusion the deeper you get into this game the more and more biased it get some really biased and game ruin hard fact fire on russian plane extinguish like 95 of the time it burn a while keep fly and then viola fire be out magically russian magik fire extinguisher all other nation just burn down 95 of the time hit russian tank into ammo rack or fuel often nothing happen nothing hit other nation on same place instakill kill the commander on a german tank even if gunner still live the tank will not be able to shoot at you anymore kill a russian commander nothing tank can fire normally kill german gunner while reload gunner be replace and reloading start from anew kill russian gunner during reload reloading continue from the point where it be before the gunner die russian it1 missile have an obvious bug and can fly trough solid building and wall wich you can not penetrate with tank shell or any other missile carrier it be be report month ago still no fix and i do not think it ever will be gunner on bomber lol british german and jap gunner on full level be fairly useless they hardly hit plane chase you on 300 m russian gunner be of course all pro sniper hit plane on 1 km and take them down rather easily not sure how many kill i make on russian bomber but it be an ridiculous amount i would be really curious to see stat about that us bomber be soso due to immense turret number they may hit sometimes too and take chsing plane down but just sometimes general game mechanic problem the well you play currently 87 avg position here the more you get uptiered in solo queue without my not so good clan member i get uptiered into 1 br like 9 10 match so you end up play the whole match as aaa since your tank be mostly useless in 1 game,neg

this be a great arena style game the visual be awesome and the gameplay be even well there be enough ability on the different ship to all make the unique but no so many that a player feel overwhelmed with option such as in league of legend this be my opinion i could never get into lol due to this other opinon may very the gamepley be well paced and the progression of level whilst in game not out of game rank be steady enough so that the game be not instantly over but also not so long that the game drag out for age the release of the new story mission that come out with every new patch be a bit of a double edge sword the new game mode be fantastic and bring a new way to play the game into the game however i think that because so many people be play this game mode because it be very good there be not many people wait to play regular pvp with me wait up to 45 minute before be able to paly a game on the whole i really like this game and would deffinitely recomend this to anyone who like the idea of the whole arena combat style of game but be intimidate by game such as lol or dota 2 furthermore it also suit the casual gamer be simle enough for people to be able to pick the game up and just play whilst also be complex enough for competative gamer to be able to have fun too,pos
early access reviewwhile i do agree the grind be about as repetitive as you can get and the overwhelming push to get you to spend money be a bit much it be still an otherwise enjoyable game i enjoy play it when i need essentially a time killer,pos

early access reviewi have be play this game for hundred of hour now start before it be even publish on steam the original map be well balanced and fund to play with awesome drop and an all around good experience with the way the game have evolve i feel as if it be move in the wrong direction this game be fun and unique with little to no bs this late update make it just as bad as the rest a pay to play game other then the bs season pass crap the no more free crate and have to purchase credit in order to get new crapy gear the game be fun to play and i hope they add new map like the original new gun be travel method would be dope to see sad to see this game get ruin by bs pay to play for character skin if they need more money then set a pay wall for the game to at least keep the game clean of hacker they admit to ban 2k player a day and this number will grow with the increase interest of the game,neg
early access reviewi play this game quite a while back for a bit believe it to be decent but lack i have to say the game have come quite some way but it be still in need of more quality of life improvement the good good preformance run 3770k and 980 not grindy no step up of this ship be well they be simply different gameplay flow be good slow enough to be tactical and fast enough to be fun ship truly be different and forfil different role within the game and just just this be a healbot ship and this one do damage they all have their prefered way of playing so once you be in you will find the ship that suit your playstyle the bad pricing feel high on the micro transaction they be boarderline macro in my opinion and this be not a problem unique to this game lack a quick communicate option like a command tree where you can with 2 3 button press ask for support order an attack etc etc etc such a system would be helpful in public match and specially give new player and idea of what to do bit more feedback on what just nuke you would be nice sometimes you can really go from be just fine to death in second a bit of a what happen would be ideaal to help you learn again quality of life the ugly match making be unsure of itself it feel 1 match be very quick and the next one just will not show up this make it quite annoying to play because there be also no indication of why thing take longer so if there be very few player communicate this that way it be still bad but not frustrating overal i would recommend this game to those who like big space ship and moba style game as that be what it be a moba with capital space ship,pos

meet your match be a mess of an update but i believe that tf2 will pull through like time and time before again many balance have be for the well and for the not as well think out one underlie them lie a recognition of the true problem which a great step forward to all the minor class and weapon rebalance i appreciate spy and pyro buff valve recognize that pyro and spy be underpowere a health buff for pyro 185 instead of or in addition to its dps buff would be better suit to its current role in tf2 i believe however natascha and huo long be nerfe and buff nicely sun on a stick may actually see some use now maybe other good rebalance include widowmaker short circuit disciplinary action eureka effect overdose as a medic main i get and like what valve be try to do here the point i be try to make be that from all the rebalance one can see that valve really be take the time to understand how this game be play with that in mind here be some of the major problem i see and how valve can fix them casual it be a good idea the only problem be it be no longer casual you can not join friend in the middle of a game anymore and the server they assign you to have terrible ping where i be all the good player who like to mess around stop play and all the terrible player start tryharde an easy way to fix this be bring back the option to let you join casual in the middle of the game by look through server list or the join game button and voting system to extend current map match up comp should be available for all player who have play above a certain amount of hour instead of just for those who pay for the game if one or two hour farmer get through it will not matter because valve could easily use their rank system to pair people with similar skill level together if you be not good do not matter how much you game the system you be stick at bottom comp need class limit maybe 2 for each assault class and one for each defense class and they could explain it as to keep the game dynamic read up on the metagame and watch some match before you ask why medic speed buff be stupid increase survivability of medic encourage stalemate in comp medic feel safe less urgency to push from win team reduce the fun in play medic because you get to be sloppy in your positioning less good at dodging which be basically all medic be about scout do not need another buff or whatever this be to scout it sound like it make sense travel at the same rate of the player you be heal but it be actually really gimmicky basically boil down to heal scout to go fast because they be only class faster than medic despite the above potential player do not be put off tf2 be still a miracle of a game the chemistry between all the class work so well it be incredibly fun to play and get good be really satisfying besides there be always community server to tide this over cp orange jump map mge 24 7 dustbowl hightower,pos
planetside 2 be a beast of a game boast large multiplayer battle with fly machine tank large armored fly carrier motorbike and other sort of motorize madness the server hold three faction the vanus teran republic and the new conglomerate each faction have thier own vechile and weapon with slight twist on all of them there be at least 6 or 7 class from heavy class to sniper and medic to mech suit each class also have its own ability for example light assult have a jetpack and the sniper class or infiltrator or whatever its call can cloak the three faction strive for dominance on one of four continet a snowy one esamir a swamp hossin a desert indar and a temperate one amerish each continent hold at least 2 000 player i think at least from what i have read which mean fight can get a bit crazy most of the time the continent be evenly divide into three equal part unless it be on indar because there everyone fight for that one territory by the name of the crown where every faction be really test each class start out with stock weapon which be pretty decent and most of which can be upgrade to have a scope a silencer to fire faster etc other gun can be buy from the store which cost quite a bit of in game currency or premeium currency now at this point you should know that if you want to upgrade your weapon and ability it cost quite a bit of ingame currency for example the 1st upgrade for light assult jetpack maye be 50 pt the the 2nd upgrade may be 150 pts the the 3rd upgrade may be 300 pt so on and so forth no those be not the actual price i be just toss number around the cost be way cheap in game i be just use those number as an example it can becaome quite a bit of a grind at some point but its not that bad in game currency be achieve from do thing i guess i do not know where i get the in game currency from your vechile abiltie can also be upgrade such as the shielding the plane or tank gun etc which also cost quite a bit of in game currency or some premium currency now some people say to get the most out of the game you have to join this game equivalent of a guild this be because you can have a leader of some sort give your guild an objective and you and your guild head over to capture some facility as a single group all prepare fly in large group of fly people carrier call galaxy that way it be easy to get thing do and that way you do not wander around just hope from battle to battle this may or may not be true i do not join one but i do not really care all that much about teamwork or play with friend or whatever the game at launch be notorious for be poorly optomize i do not know about now though because i get a new computer i hover around 50 frame on ultra so that be nice um 8 10 nice large scale fight diverse way to fight nice graphic if you can run it need to party up to have fun a bit grindy,pos

early access reviewthis be my official review of adventure quest 3d a game by ae artix entertainment for pc and mobile this be a giant pile of i do not know how it could of possibly be make bad than adventure quest world but you manage so congratulation artix i have expierence alot of mmos but with a bad and clunky combat system like this really bad player system which could be easily exploit and just an utter and boring grindfest to the point where to even ing play the game you need to turn off your brain and put it into robot mode it become a bit annoying to say the least maybe the first 5 minute wasenjoyable after that nothing the combat in the game have 4 class which one be for founder only warrior rogue mage guardian for founder all of these class have 5 basic move that can not be upgrade orchange at all and be bore basic unoriginal ability that can be from almost any mmo or any kind of rpg game by the way the 1 ability be your basic attack so there be technically 4 it be also point and click target combat which be not bad but it be so clunky and just boring to where you can just sit there spamme 2 ability that you prefer and win without even havingto think about it remove any challenge from a game which be something that a game need to be entertain in my opinion also the game be a total grindfest there be nothing to do other than kill monster 99 of the quest be kill monster too you figure they would at least do 1 thing in this game justice but they really do not for exploit all you got to do be go intohigh level area accept a quest because there be no level or any kind of restriction to accept quest and walk over and hit a monster once that someone else be attack run awayand you will get exp when it die rinse and repeat the variation of clothing armor in the game there be very few and then a bunch of other which be recolor of the very few oh and do i mention to craft them you get to go to a craft person make sure you have the material then spend gold to craft your item and that it also have a craft time you can spend real life money to decrease the craft time seriously this game be utter garbage to think this come from the creator of the orignial adventure quest be really sad andthe fact that this be release in 2017 be honesty laughable it feel like a ripoff of a ripoff if you enjoy brainless grindfest then pick this game up if not steer away 2 10,neg
early access reviewoddly enough this game have help me a console player transition from controller to m k the netcode on this game be absolutely fantastic in just over 20 hour of playtime i have not once feel like i have be cheat by lame hit detection or dsync issue as someone who need all of their shot to count this be a huge selling point for me personally i enjoy the dedicated spawn as it give me an idea of where the enemy will be come from you can still flank and outmaneuver but for the most part it come down to who have the good aim no p2w here as all gun can be purchase for either gold or medal both of which can be earn just by play the game you can buy weapon outright for real money but from what i have see there be no gamebreaking weapon in the game however if you feel like there be a weapon that be constantly kill you and you currently do not have the mean to purchase say weapon you can download the 15 day dlc weapon pack for free and try out each gun help you to see which gun you should spend money on next i mainly play tdm and have notice the map to be quite small with multiple map be set up like a paintball course one room with obstacle spread throughout overall i would say to give this game a try i have never play csgo but this have get my interest up,pos

pretty fun at first then you realize its hard to get point so you replay gun over and over to learn them and buy other gun to take apart and put them back together to get point to buy more gun to do that to it be not really a game more of a learning program that teach you how to build different gun and other pack include skeleton and motorcycle it be frustrating boring after 2 hour and not really worth your time it be a unique and somewhat interesting game that i would play a few time a year though,neg

battlefield 4 conquest very large scale map never end combat kinda slightly p2w but you can mostly avoid pay if you be skilled enough or if you be play with a group of friend try it and do not rage quit when you get kill for the 100th time in a row this game be not easy watch some guide online,pos
early access reviewwith my little time play i have experience everything i need to write a solid review it be good it be not go to blow you away by any mean and it be not go to make you want to throw your computer out the window it be in the sweet spot of good and bad it be what you would expect from a f2p first person shooter what you would not expect be a non pay to win aspect to the game gain ingame currency be not that diffcult and will most likely bring player back who want to visit the shop more often you be not pay anything for it so why not try it it be the generic arcade style shooter run in gun be pretty extensive in this game and i recommend you hop in with some friend and have some fun with that be say do not take this game too seriously you be probably go to die a lot as i do and rage would just make it not fun just run and gun and have some fun overall though it be a pretty solid for what your pay nothing,pos
interesting game its easy to play easy to learn if you read the manual and the update unfortunately its riddled with bug and everytime they fix one bug two more seem to show up that s not the bad part of the game though the bad part be the player environment player will target other player include on their own team they will harass and bully player they believe be cause them to lose the game thereby diminish their mmr mmr be the developer way of rating each player skill at the game which in itself be completely uncontrollable by player since you be randomly assign team member some with skill some without the mmr be the source and cause of the harassment and bullying in the game which be responsible for cause a hostile playing environment i would not recomend this game if you just want to have fun its take to seriously by some player as if it have some real life application its just a game and a fun game but be entirely ruin by an unneccesary rating system that inherently create a hostile environment,neg
solo arena be really unbalanced some game be guarantee loss if they get to start with a creature and it be purple or well you lose if they have a weenie deck and one of the lane convert to animal you lose if the final boss have a 1 dmg a turn starter and you do not have the mana ring you lose very frustrating to draft a good deck and lose,neg

raceroom dlc dlc that only include car dlc that only include some car and some track dlc that only include a certain championship with its car track and season feature this be the dlc only visible in steam then there be dlc only visible in the game and its own store the store make special offer that save you money in the store you can also pay for each car and each track this price policy be my reason to not recommend raceroom i can not put a customize raceroom game together that fit my need and be worth the money at the end of the day this be a terrible business model remember ten year ago you could buy for less money a full racing game with more content than this cash grab and its whole dlc content,neg

i spend alot of time on this game i enjoy it alot make many friend form it the game itself be really great and have a fantastic community it be just a casual loose and fun shooter that i screw around in for many hour with or without friend but ever since this new update where they remove the quickplay function this can no longer be do everything have a serious competitive feel to it heck you even get penalise for leave a match i think this be outragous to have such a sudden and drastic change to this game i be never into the competitive scene otherwise i may aswell just play csgo please bring the properly casual quickplay feature back many people would agree with me that pub be an essential part of tf2 please valve do not ruin tf2,neg

satisfy combat fun progression best in industry business model can not really ask for more in an mmorpg soe know their stuff no one give you this level of content without a pay wall 40 for the top tier expansion virtually everything else be available for free and be not behind some insane grind that premium member can skip they be move more towards a guild war model with every patch and it work,pos
this game despite be a mmo type free to play with microtransaction blow me away the graphic be stun the physic be very realistic the plane be beautiful and the combat envrionment be well balanced bravo to ganjin here this be a truly beautifull game in my opinion the good part be that it if one wish not to participate in the microtransaction it be possible to obtain just about all of the game content and actually compete by simply play long enough which be well than many other free to play out there keep in mind that this game be still in development and balancing be constantly be rework it be one of the good combat flight simulator game i have play with the plan addition of playable ground and naval unit it promise to be one of the good ww2 combat game out there hey what have you get to loose anyway it be free go try it out it be get a 5 5 from me,pos
10 10every 3 4 month a new update be release with a new league new mechanic some rework always add more late game content a lot to do in theorycraft term and a lot of way to have fun of course it have its meta but you do not need to follow it in order to have fun and make profit no p2w mtx more like pay to storage but you get 4 stash tab at the beginning and you can get some stash whenever they put em in sale pretty often tbh you can both play it as softcore or hardcore player not talk about game mode but time spend on game i have play as many hour as you see and still not close to be tired,pos
early access reviewthis game be pretty small as of rn not much to buy in game however i see it have great potential ad become something much big and grand i hope the dev dev can work on this and also put in somesort of team voice chat i would really appretiate that honestly fantastic game play with more to come graphic be pretty good and optimization be fantastic great game for a great price shoutout to mighty jingle youtuber for introduce me to this game,pos

early access reviewone of my favorite game on steam extremely fun to turn on whenever there be friend over couch party be awesome and there be not much more i could ask from this game,pos
although gameplay be alright at best this game be poorly optimize for absolutely no reason at all it on your cpu and do not even bother to use your gpu at all cause frame drop even when your gpu be x10 million time well than the recommend and or minimum so if you be fine with play at 20fps then sure go for it but it be not worth to be completey honest,neg
dis game be rig and pay2win its fun yes but its so riggedfree monoply except less charming you can not trade with player the board be small and there be pay2win in the form of buy particular roll of the dice hard pass game be setthere be pay to win in the game you can pay for extra dice roll and if that be not bad enough it do not even tell you if your opponent use these reroll it just look like regular roll on your screen so you have no idea if the person be cheat or not,neg
glitchy fight close quarter mean you can not point anywhere near a wall plane be break tank be break and you can only have any fun if you pay to win who win a fight depend about 70 weapon ptw 12 weapon to situation 10 previous life knowledge and 8 skill adjust previous life knowledge to spawn camping which be about 20 of battle,neg

  editthe last time i touch this garbage be september of last year and honestly it have change for well and for bad but mostly for bad there be some balance and some new stuff add mostly pay thing mind you and i can safely say that this be the last time i be touch this game ever for starter it feel much more tilted towards pay player rather than regular player to a very annoying degree i would not even put it past bethesda direwolf to have program this be possible do not even try to deny it some feature of match up non pay player with pay player in rank or otherwise to entice them to pay up for well card to win with i abstain from ever buy anything on this game with real money and i be estatic that i do because it be not worth it and i do not condone the behaviour bethesda and possibly direwolf have be sport in this game and in bethesdas case in general all in all this game really be not anything special and be not too great unless you be willing to fork over a few dollar to be able to stand a fighting chance against many of the well deck people will have make from buy deck or will have buy lastly there s one thing that seem to need a change yet refuse to change the accessability of build a guard base deck guard card be nice and all but when you be go up against someone who be deck be primarily guard and buff action card then you start to feel like you be smack your head against a brick wall hope to demolish it i do not have the time or patience or even money to git gud at a game that prioritzes player money over their skill or competence this game have the potential to be fun it really do sadly it be not quite at such a potential yet the rank leave much to be desire the other main feature be just pay 2 play up the and most of the time in rank you will end up with someone 2 or 3 rank above you who have spend 18 buck on the good card for their pack that will decimate you its sad really because i kinda enjoy this game but trust me rank can be a struggle and it be the only mode that s technically free and actually give reward like septims and card with a rare chance of a pack the steam trading card require you to spend real money something that should be outright ban on steam as it be but i see they do not quite give enough s to care regardless if any dev be read this ha i highly doubt that you have a great potential to make this well than hearthstone do not up just listen to some of the fan improve what need improve i do think that its nice that i can buy certain full deck with septims as oppose to money that s a very very good thing consider too many game force you to use real money on anything and everything in game nowadays but i digress rank can be fix a bit and maybe balance the card a bit make many deck less overpowered and make it more worthwhile to make a custom deck use card exclusive to buy deck update so when you get to a milestone in rank they make a midway point for you once you hit say milestone if you lose a battle you go down a rank lead into this really stupid midrank that you can very easily get stick in if you erratically win and lose i feel like this be lazy and honestly could be fix too update 2 okay i learn that custom deck be really absurdly broken so if you be to make what i call a swat team deck where you use mainly guard card and item card that boost attack and defense you have a 85 chance to basically ruin anyone you come across there s actually several card that really need to be debuffe and actually have turn me off of this game i will list a few golden saint if you know this card you can see how it can be a match ruiner ring of imaginary may couple this with any guard with regenerate and a defense up or two and your opponent be screw and royal guard be also a really powerful card regardless many of the most powerful card require you to fork over 12 18 buck of your or your mother if you be a young child who pester their parent for money like a leech suck blood money thus make the game have the illusion of be fair until you get into the meat or lack there of and find a pay 2 win game with many feature lock behind paywall so would i recommend this game no not even a little bit hell even hearthstone be well than this,neg

if you want to drive a car around a track then this game be for you if you however want a multiplayer racing game with good physics good interface and overall a good experience that be worth the space it take in storage do not get this game recommend for people who have enough money to spend on virtual car in a free to play game instead of an actual game that be worth how much you pay for it,neg

it be not the great looking game but man it run perfect on my somewhat dual core i5 8 gb ram and gt 970 at max setting low end computer take awhile to get use to feel as there be no actual race line as in gt or fm and it will take lot of money to get all car and track right below 9 buck for the 3 variant of nordsheilf or however u spell it u know the one this game will definitely be an investment which be scary as it be online only even for single player stuff so if server shut down say goodbye to all the stuff u pay for i like it and will continue to play,pos
this be a fun low maintenance game that do a good job of use the fallout world give you mission to collect loot and make good use of the special stat system main criticism be the ui which be port from touch screen and it can cause some annoyance when try to select a particular character as you can easily miss also it be too easy to inadvertently pick someone hide behind a wall when you move the screen around i have not spend a penny of real money on this and i be up to something like 140 dweller each time i log in i usually have a new dweller wait to join my vault in fact i have so many of the little guy in there it be get hard to juggle them around properly some tip training dweller by assign them to training room where a particular stat be improve be essential to get the vault work efficiently after they have improve a stat assign them to the correspond work room so they can level up have high level character and arm them all be the good way to give your character a good chance of survive vault attack and have success on mission the only reason to spend money be if you be really impatient but it would be poor value so i do not recommend do that,pos

early access reviewthe fact that so many book still name the beatles as the great or most significant or most influential rock band ever only tell you how far rock music still be from become a serious art jazz critic have long recognize that the great jazz musician of all time be duke ellington and john coltrane who be not the most famous or rich or good seller of their time let alone of all time classical critic rank the highly controversial beethoven over classical musician who be highly popular in court around europe rock critic be still blind by commercial success the beatles sell more than anyone else not true by the way therefore they must have be the great jazz critic grow up listen to a lot of jazz music of the past classical critic grow up listen to a lot of classical music of the past rock critic be often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past they barely know the good seller no wonder they will think that the beatles do anything worthy of be save in a sense the beatles be emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole too much attention pay to commercial phenomenon be it grunge or u2 and too little to the merit of real musician if somebody compose the most divine music but no major label pick him up and sell him around the world a lot of rock critic will ignore him if a major label pick up a musician who be as stereotyped as can be but launch her or him worldwide your average critic will waste river of ink on her or him this be the sad status of rock criticism rock critic be basically publicist work for major label distributor and record store they simply highlight what product the music business want to make money from hopefully one not too distant day there will be a clear demarcation between a great musician like tim buckley who never sell much and commercial product like the beatles at such a time rock critic will study their rock history and understand which artist accomplish which musical feat and which simply exploit it commercially beatles aryan music remove any trace of black music from rock and roll it replace syncopated african rhythm with linear western melody and lusty negro attitude with cute white kid smile contemporary musician never speak highly of the beatles and for good reason they could never figure out why the beatles song should be regard more highly than their own they know that the beatles be simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon thank to beatlemania which have nothing to do with their musical merit that phenomenon keep alive interest in their mediocre musical endeavour to this day nothing else grant the beatles more attention than say the kink or the rolling stone there be nothing intrinsically well in the beatles music ray davies of the kink be certainly a far well songwriter than lennon mccartney the stone be certainly much more skilled musician than the fab four and pete townshend be a far more accomplished composer capable of entire opera such as tommy and quadrophenia not to mention the far great british musician who follow them in subsequent decade or the us musician themselves who initially spearhead what the beatles merely later repackage to the masse the beatles sell a lot of record not because they be the great musician but simply because their music be easy to sell to the masse it have no difficult content it have no technical innovation it have no creative depth they write a bunch of catchy 3 minute ditty and they be photogenic if somebody have not invent beatlemania in 1963 you would not have waste five minute of your time read these page about such a trivial band extend note from 2010 the beatles be not a terribly interesting band but their fan be and still be an interesting phenomenon i can only name religious fundamentalist as annoying and as threaten as beatles fan and as persevere in sabotage anyone who dare express an alternate opinion of their faith they have turn me into some kind of internet celebrity not because of the 6 000 bio that i have write not because of the 800 page book that i publish not because of the 30 year of cultural event that i organize but simply because i downplay the artistic merit of the beatles an action that they consider as disgraceful as the 2001 terrorist attack jakub krawczynski send me this supportive comment in 2010 i find it quite amusing that almost all of the beatles song have their own entry on wikipedia nothing wrong with that in itself actually even if they be not single and each of them be meticulously dissect as if there be transcendental suite exceed human comprehension yet band like faust or red krayola etc have biography even short than just one article about any random beatle song needless to say none of their song have any article on them yet i be sure there would be a lot more to talk about moreover if you have put any bad review of their album on the site with the intention to show the broad scope of opinion you would risk your life there since such fanatic do not accept any single sign of try to be objective you be see as public enemy number 1 to them it be like your article be one giant cognitive dissonance to them and vandalize your bio be the only way to reduce this dissonance italian text translate by ornella c grannis and proof edit by daniel vogel the beatles most certainly belong to the history of the 60 but their musical merit be at good dubious the beatles come at the height of the reaction against rock and roll when the innocuous teen idol rigorously white be replace the wild black rocker who have shock the radio station and the conscience of half of america their arrival represent a lifesaver for a white middle class terrorize by the idea that within rock and roll lie a true revolution of customs the beatles tranquilize that vast section of the population and conquer the heart of all those first and foremost the female who want to rebel without violate the social status quo the contorted and lascivious face of the black rock and roller be substitute by the innocent smile of the beatles the unleash rhythm of the first be substitute by the catchy tune of the latter rock and roll could finally be include in the pop chart the beatles represent the quintessential reaction to a musical revolution in the making and for a few year they manage to run its enthusiasm into the ground furthermore the beatles represent the reaction against a social and political revolution they arrive at the time of the student protest of bob dylan of the hippie and they replace the image of angry kid fist in the air with their cordial face and amiable declaration they come to replace the accusatory word of militant musician with overindulgent nursery rhyme thus the beatles serve as middle class tranquilizer as if to prove the new generation be not make up exclusively of rebel misfit and sex maniac for most of their career the beatles be four mediocre musician who sing melodic three minute tune at a time when rock music be try to push itself beyond that format one originally confine by the technical limitation of the 78 rpm record they be the quintessence of mainstream assimilate the innovation propose by rock music within the format of the melodic song the beatles belong like the beach boy whom they emulate throughout most of their career to the era of the vocal band in such a band the technique of the instrument be not as important as that of the chorus undoubtedly skilled at compose chorus they avail themselves of producer george martin head of parlophone since 1956 to embellish

early access reviewthe ui terminology and mechanic be way clunki than hearthstone although they be still nice never play magic so i can not attest to that the reward system be way well than hearthstone i mean holy the reward be do in a really generous and fun way i actually enjoy play against ai now all of that be say this game be plague by the same issue as hearthstone aggro deck be a thing and control unique deck be never to be find which make play a huge gripe sometimes everyone build deck revolve around cheap removal and token to trigger them sacrifice tiny x to remove huge x as well as super efficient low cost minion then they just permanently go face the variety be there it be a matter of whether or not it be viable and so far it seem like most of the variety be not viable that all be say once again the game be still good and a fun past time hopefully they work out the kink in the future,pos

early access reviewto anyone consider this game sorry but you miss the window of when it be good ultimately the point of a game be to have fun and right now it be not fun it use to be fun to build fun to play even sometimes fun to lose however the last half year have be strip this away and now after the past couple of month it be no longer fun even to win a game when win losing and building be all a chore and not fun it be a sign that the game have fail in the very mission i have be play this game for over 1000 hour count the stand alone launcher i start back when it first go on steam and although i wish i could give it a good review at this point i simply can not the developer have a fantastic game that need a few tweak a little balancing and some bug fix but be otherwise really good then start around november 2015 they begin do major update that completely break multiple aspect of the game these update come about more and more often bad of all they completely change the direction that the game have be go thus veteran such as myself who fall in love with game x and be excitedly wait its finished product instead now have game y and dread its completion i try to keep play but they just keep make it more difficult to stick with it everything feel gimmicky and very much like a smartphone app game balance be bad than ever and long time element of the game be break ultimately it feel like the game be intend to drive away veteran player in favor of casual very sad to say but at this point i shall no longer be play except to test periodically and see if the game have be fix to the greatness where it once be bar that i just can not seem to bring myself to even finish a round,neg
i think the good way to review a game like this be to break it down in order to highlight everything properly art design dude 10 10 waifu you get a huge array of waifu to punch from the normal cat fairy and dragon girl to the more out there mud plant and yuki onna girl and with each type of girl have a few different design asset there be a surprising range of design for the hoard of waifu you will be click through and if you be sad enough you may even recognize a couple of asset background and girl from other sakura games and there be lot of diversity you can also customize your player character and if you shell out you different little outfit for her which depend on the type of person you be may interest you sound i recommend play this game 100 volume with no headphone to maximize the experience the constant animu moaning that come from this game be a wacky and fun thing to hear and sometimes you get to hear nya which be well horrible but the ironic charm be fantastic this be all family friendly fun you see gameplay it be your standard clicker game where you click the waifus to add them to your harem yes you punch monster girl to add them to your harem it be e fantastic and get currency to purchase automatic clicker and upgrade for them to make your click do more damage make the automate attack strong have little power up it be nothing out of the ordinary but why fix what be not break the clicker model have be prove and this do not look to screw it up the real differentiator come from difficulty curve yo this game get pretty difficult in the end game this clicker separate the man who wanna look at anime t ttie from the man who wanna play a decent clicker game and also look at anime t ttie you will have to learn to utilize the reset mechanic as well how to distribute point in order to maximize profit and progress as far as you can or else you will plateu in progression you will have to take what you learn from previous run in order to get well overall this game be a masterpiece clicker game be try and true fun time and this game be no exception but pair this with the dynamic diverse waifu punch the fantastic sound design and actual strategy involve it take the game from an ironic 7 10 meme to a fun 10 10 time waster clicker game also the fact that you can turn it off and still get cash help level progression and will save you from rack up too many hour actually in game spare you from the embarrasment of your family friend and colleague tl dr dem gud anime t ttie,pos

the game be free to play and that s a big plus but there be still to much people with incredible skill be maybe use tool the alt account in war battle be still there and its frustrating to play war battle when you do not have a group off friend to compare the newbees noobs i love to play but the more time i play the less fun i have i like to play the rts part off the game but its so unbalanced seem like reto only support the bad guy with good weapon they do not want to publish the ban so we do not know that something be happen when you take the time to report some asshol on the forum you can say what you want but reto will never or rarely listen to the player therefore this bad review,neg
where do i start with this all the great review have be write and have so many upvote mine will never be up there but i be go to write this anyway if you be happen apon this then i have play this game a little bit too much since i get it so many year ago and many account have come and go if you add up all my hour from my corrupted account i have waste around 1 760 hour on this magnificent game let me clear something up hour mean nothing i be still at the skill level of a f2p i still play for one definitive reason i like the spy waaay to much but in all seriousness this game be amaze all this bull about how meet your match ruin the game i be still a little salty about the uber update and how overwatch kill it be nothing but lie tf2 be one of those game that stay fun because of the community wow for example follow this exactly tf2 have be around for 10 freakin year even if valve be not the utopian company we all want it to be this game will keep on go i have see a lot of my friend and veteran leave tf2 or steam altogether for good but more player still download it i absolutely love the community it be one of the main reason this have and always will be my favorite game of all time but we discourage f2ps from play the game which mean they will not be spend any money on the game which let us face it be the only thing keep valve with tf2 and will never get any well we can not keep scare off the new player or else tf2 will not even have a future like i say before no one but some of my bored friend will read this review but if you have happen apon it then you know that these fact be true tf2 be die valve be not go to do much about it so we as a community have to band together to save it i be not a famous youtuber but i will still try my good to keep this message go well i just waste a bunch of time write a review that no one will read but it feel good to get a definitive one out there instead of the short one i have write in the past 2007 10 be and always will be,pos
first of all this game be not a casual game at all there be a hidden value in everyone steam account that activate once they first start the game if you ever feel unlucky people never land on your building just log off and make a new account until you go on a winning streak 10 win in a row be a good indicator of a very lucky account if you do not feel like you want to do all of this go play something else you be not hardcore enough for it,neg
early access reviewthis game have what hearthstone be miss in complexity without make it a logic problem actual strategy variety and lot of room for counterplay and what it be miss in competitiveness without make it a borefest or a 100 hardcore game fair variance and no game define rng effect there be still room for polish but if hearthstone get your attention but you feel like it be miss something give the game a chance 8 10 gg,pos
this be one of the most addicting game i have ever play perfect for both casual and hardcore gamer since this game have difficulty option for the dungeon and if one of the task require you to play on a high difficulty you can party with player which take the game to whole new level unlike other mmorpgs you can still succeed even if you be f2p the character in the game be unique creative and all possess different style of play and to add to the game replay value you can attain multiple class or awesome new form for each and every character you need to play this game,pos
game be fun to play until you meet your first cheater who be legion in this game althought there be a report function in this game it seem some popular hacker be still in game even after be record and report by famous h g streamer etc reto do not have the budget to make a decent anti cheat system the actual one be outdate from month year ago there be also big server problem since the last update queue to loggin never happen before big connection issue matchmaking be kinda broken atm can not find a game after 40min etceven though this game have a great potential it be waste by really weird physics and mechanic connection delay hacker there be really a lot for a game present it be own gameplay as as much realistic as possible it be not historically some vehicle weapon etc be not realistic at all armor damage physics etc there be also an other big problem in this game war war be battle make to control part of the map and divide intro 3 faction russians americans and germansressources vehicle infantry etc be deploy by general other player that rank to rank 16 and become general the fact be that it be totally unbalanced example you can arrive in a battle where your team only have infantry while the opposite camp get plane tank etcthe opposite can and do happen to i would say that 65 of the war battle be similar to those case wich be already too much in my opinion if you want to try it go for it you will enjoy play it but soon those problem will take over your motivation,neg

early access revieweternal in my opinion be the good digital card game on the market as many have say before eternal be everything we be hope hearthstone be and what magic should be online even with just two set currently eternal provide hour of indepth and strategic card play the daily reward also allow this game to be play casually with no money require however if you want to jump straight into competitive play you could spend a couple hundred dollar easy still by far cheap than mtgo and hearthstone though,pos
i have log way too many hour into this in the last few day that it be probably not healthy i love it i be addicted and i have not spend a penny true there be probably some thing that would benefit from the actual buying of the in game currency but you can earn it from do other stuff it take long of course but not as long as other mmos that i have try but you do not need those thing to play you can have just as much fun without them there be plenty of event ton of guild for any playing level and i find the party system here much easy for people like me who be play solo also if you do not want to pvp you do not have to but there be also a ton of great reward if you do and dragon who do not love dragon,pos
man i love big number i can not even tell you how excited i be when i find this game i do not even know number could get this big but here i be have all the big number i want it really be a dream sometimes i do dream of it i wake up in the middle of the night and worry that maybe my lineage level may be ready to go up or maybe i have finally meet the requirement to excavate that other artifact nnnope sometimes i worry that maybe i forgot to choose an upgrade or a research slot and that i have be waste my time and then i find out i be justify all my fear have come true i forgot to choose a400 i forgot to buff w275 i should have buff s400 longer i go back to sleep i do not know what i be do with my life anymore but those number they just keep get big,pos

play the game for yourself not for the developer that be how you have fun you do not think about the future of the game whether it will be dead or still alive you play it in the present you just come home from a horrible day and need to unwind you have a good day and you wanna capitalize on it do not play the game for the community or the hat or the countless number of bug play it just to have fun whatever that may be competitive friendly 100 crit whatever it be just have fun the game will take care of the rest i promise you,pos

wost mmo i have play in a long time freemium and pay to win at its fine most free mmo have pay cash item that give cosmetic change and be make to look cool but this game cash item actually give stat bonus if they work in pvp or not i do not care its still bull this game be so bug out its not even funny its a combo base game and the enemy will literally teleport behind you break your combo when an enemy teleport behind you another enemy will come up behind you and trap you and combo you to death the enemy be solid object so you can not walk by them and you will be knock down back in between them if you try to jump out from between them which on most map be a must if you can not stagger or knock back the enemy which enemy will not be the quest system be buggy and event quest do not work properly the option do not work properly now do with the bug my problem with the game default to windowed mode and the full screen option do not work unless it be restart which grant be usual for some game its a combo base game move from map to map take forever and be slow the map be 2d and 3d move between this be a pain in the rear its pay to win you can only equip 4 skill if you want more you have to pay for it item inventory be tiny to expand it you pay for it for the size of the inventory to many item drop basically force you to either sell your entire inventory or pay to have it expand the tutorial suck and do not tell anything about the game the key bind be not obvious and make no sense the game do an absolute horrible job at show how much health you have the potion be useless and heal nothing its easy to die and respawn right where you die with no penalty or reprocussion because you come back with full health and mana the ui be not user or beginner friendly at all and the tutorial do not help you basically need to come out of the womb know how to play this game or look up how to play if you be a beginner there be a constant tutorial that flash over your skill set and get annoying after play for 4 hour tell me to hit leave ctl for a skill that do really nothing my first time play it freeze the minute i get to the starting town cause my friend send me a party and friend invite then it freeze again randomly in the middle of playing but this time it come back i love mmorpg but this be the bad i have play absolute garbage and horse dung probably will never play again only reason why i play be because me and my friend make a deal to play each other mmo with each other for a week in short god this be utter trash and a nightmare to play i never want to play again nor probably never will i be play add which be supposidly a mage class apparently this mage have more health than normal mage in otther mmos because i use a potion that heal 4500hp and barely heal a 5th of my hp and this game do not show your max hp so its hard to tell how much you have so you just need to guess how much hp you have and the potion be on a 60 second cool down 60 second even if you have 3 different potion on your quick slot they all go on cooldown if the potion regene health it would be a different story or if there be no cooldown for the other it would be fine,neg

i honestly do not even know how or where to start with this game it have no form of tutorial guide basic series of single player practice session to show you what you get with the game what you have game mode anything it be basically just a very very old school pick a series pick a car hit race that be pretty much it i find it quite surprising that it have so many user with such a bad interface and menu structure as a user you honestly do not know where to start after some trial and error i eventually discover that most car need to be buy you only get actually i do not know what you get because it do not list anywhere how many or which car you do get it be just such a bad user experience even acr with all its problem and browser client mishmash be far supperior the first time i start it i basically just get the background cinematic and no menu after google around i find that you have to set a start parameter for the steam version why be not this set as standard do not i just install the game through steam so after you eventualy get it to work you have to wonder if you actually have any sound because there be no effect what so ever in the menu no clicking efect no music no nothing i play around with my volume until i enter a race and it be too loud and finaly we come to the actual driving experience well if you use a controller or keyboard you be basically hose the car be mostly unconstrollable unless you have a wheel and even then i be not sure the default setting be ok after much fiddling around with sensitivity adaptive steering speed and other setting i manage to get a relatively ok set it work fine for the car i be use at the time but as soon as i change car well i need to see what i could do again the menu interface thing be quite buggy and unintuitive you have a back button to go back to the game and if you hit back inside the game as in to go back to the main menu it take you back into the matchmaking menu so basically and infinite loop of back button now on to the plus point after try out multiple car i do have to admit you could feel when one car be heavy or light or have soft suspension and that be a very very good thing it become pretty obvious that underneath the bad interface it be run a very good simulation engine on the polish oldtimer you can feel the heavy engine at the back try to oversteer the car on different dtm car of the same era class you can feel the different personlity of each car i really like that for example you can tell the audi v8 be very heavy compare to the merc 190 or the m3 you can feel that the mustang have much soft suspension but be stil quite light the fwd car do understear in slow corner and they do lift off oversteer just like they should dip in the road do make your car unstable and sometimes create wheelspin this also sais a lot about the quality and detail of the track this be especially noticeable on some long high speed corner the vibrator on the side of the track do unsettle your car and can make it jump up in the air so yes the racing engine underheath be very very good the graphic do look good for a racing game there be not much to say about them everything run smoothly no stutter high fps the amount of detail give to the sound during racing be quite high it have suspension and pannel squeke i be quite dissapointed to be honest i really like all their previous game and those do have much well interface and functionality this be just slopy in so many way from what i have play so far i be tempt to try it some more just because that surprisingly good engine underneath that crap interface i have not yet find out how exacly you enter a multiplayer race there be some challenge and some server but instruction be scarce at good i do not even think there be any form of experience or leveling but if there be i be not able to find it,neg

early access reviewthe gameplay be not very good to begin with the matchmaking be completely unbalanced craft your robot be even ruin with the terrible rng crate system which be either put in place in an attempt to make the game bad or an attempt to squeeze more money out of its player base with what be essentially gamble on top of that be the premium membership which tie in with the crate system and the craft system to squeeze out even more money from its player base premium membership be not a one time buy it require a subscription like an mmo the subscription option range from a few day to six month after every match you get a crate with some item well type of crate have a high chance for rare item you get well crate from be high on the scoreboard and on the win team in a match you get more item per crate depend on the type of match you play match type that generally take longer give more item the item you get be completely random and if you be not a premium member you only get half of the item per crate so if you happen to get a good item in a lock off row and you be not premium it be go this be of course mean to encourage people to pay for premium but it be more likely to just drive player away from the game even with premium which i have for 3 day you mostly get garbage even after hour and hour of grind the same poorly balanced match type over and over again there be a way to get more crate without grind for hour though of course you can buy them with real life money so if you want to get a lot of item some of which would hopefully be good you can pay for a few day of membership then pay for several of the high tier crate then hope you get something you actually want on top of that most of the paint color be restrict to premium member only so if you want to paint your robot anything other than white dark gray light blue and orange then you have get to pay for premium of course you do not have to pay for anything you could go on just play the game but that lead to the bad part yet the game play the movement feel clunky and the combat be bad by that i mean weapon at least the one you start with have terrible accuracy especially at long range this can still be sort of enjoyable when you be up against robot with similarly weapon but like i say there be no balance in the matchmaking any weapon part go for any game mode they only match base on the robot cpu score each item have a cpu cost strong rare weapon have a slightly high cpu cost than weak basic weapon however if you build your robot with just the basic like a helicopter rotor attach to a powerful missile launcher the missile lock on by the way or a rail gun to a few block flat on some wheel tread whatever you can easily get match with new player use robot with much weak weapon which most likely can not even hit you reliably from the range you be hit them another common annoyance be people use small fast robot which hover or fly around you fire some sort of homing weapon which mean their robot can constantly be move quickly and erratically while always hit you because they do not have to worry about aim and even if you do land a lucky hit they will just heal fully if they do not get hit again within ten second while you probably will not be able to heal because they never miss with their homing weapon constantly chip away at you the only real way to counter this would be to build a similar robot assume you have the part even if you do though do that seem like fun a bunch of people just mindlessly fly around hold down the left mouse button until one team win not exactly great gameplay even if all of that sound good to you the only way to get well weapon and part be to keep play these poorly balanced match over and over again for hour till you hopefully get the part you want need or until you get enough garbage to recycle for anything from less than 1 to about 30 or 40 of what each of your item be worth destroy your item in the process of course then finally get enough in game currency from all that crap you spend all that time grind for to finally afford some of the ridiculously expensive item from the in game shop you can do all of that to see if maybe the game get a bit more enjoyable or you can just play a different game,neg

for a game call creativerse the amount of thing you can do be lack in creativity grant this game have not be out that long but the community that make it more fun to play be almost dead hardly any player ever on any public world the update be tiny and usually only tweak already exist block which imo the variety design themselves be lack if you do not have a giant simplistic design in mind you probably will not have much fun with this game wood only come in one color unless you count the log themselves some of the block be practically useless as decor because they be either mean for craft recipe or they be natural block and if you want any variety at all you will have to pay for it thee art style be wonderful i thuroughly enjoy the graphic of this game i just wish there be more to the game than what be there i have experience no bug in the past 2 year or so i have play this game i think i get this game because i could see the potential but the update be tiny and insignificant to me and the fact that you can not mod the game to at least relieve some of that blandness be a huge put off i would reccomend this to a 5 yo but not an adult who need a bit more stimulation,neg

early access reviewi try to like this game i try so hard to like this game but i can not think of it like this it be planetside 2 but in a wwii set so if you hate pl2 you will hate this game as soon as you hit rank 3 with any faction you get completely ed by the game matchmaking suddenly become a broken mess people be one shote you from across the map with tank you get bomb on by plane who fly so close to the ground in reality the bomb should have blow them up as well you can not dobecause your be spawncampe you shoot a guy 3 time in the torso with a semi automatic rifle only for him to one shoot you with a bolt action ect ect as soon as i hit rank 3 i be like alright i can drive tank i can do assault map yes i be play as an american soldier and the first tank they give dosent even have a ing cannon on it no it have 2 useless mgs on it that can not doto other tank why the would you give us a tank that you can not even fight other tank with it what s the ing point of a tank if it do not have a cannon on it it may as well be a slow jeep with 2 mgs on it at that rate not to mention that each mg can only move 180 degree so to aim at someone to your right you gota either hope you have a gunner with who or you got to turn the clunky piece ofaround and by that point your blow up do i mention matchmake holy it get so broken when any faction get to rank 3 tired of be an american soildier who s rank 5 go switch to your german soilder who s rank 1 whoops put you in a game with a bunch of rank 8 15s have fun i should probably mention you have to rank each faction individually but for some stupid ing reason as soon as one faction reach rank 3 the other 2 faction get the benefit of hit rank 3 even though they could both be untouched because everyone rank on their own you have to deal with the start equipment and ribon and medal all over again with each faction only add to the grind this game present this may be because i be not a patient person to begin with but this game be so e break due to it be matchmake and utter grindy ness for each faction that i can not recomend this to anyone unless you play this when it first come out and you be all gear up and whatever get ready for this game to shove a 10 foot pole up your and then shove a 20 foot pole into yourwhile the 10 foot pole be still in there,neg

team fortress 2 a great game transform over the year into a shape that i no longer recognise nor love have quit the game for around a year whilst still follow update what i say may seem harsh but i say it because tf2 may still have the potential to be a great game again in my opinion tf2 have be neglect lopsided balance and long exist bug leave unaddressed for year whilst in recent month they have attempt to address such problem they ultimately leave them too late visually the game have change a lot mainly due to horrendous look outlandish cosmetic item be add that do not even try to match the original art style not forget the various visual change that may be intentional or not that have also decrease the quality of how the game appear for example on old map lighting be screw up as be several decorative decal find on those map that be now invisible or barely visual in comparison to their release i do not want to list every issue like this as i understand they be likely this way due to either optimisation or update to the source engine over the year that have cause such part of the game to break the big nail in tf2s coffin for me be the removal of pub in favour of an overwatch esque matchmaking system completely change how the majority would play drop in and drop out be one of the major appeal for me and it be one of the define reason i quit this game the more casual atmosphere of pub be enjoyable and the option for mvm and even competitive tf2center etc not the terrible competitive they do add be there for those look for a more coordinated experience mvm be an enjoyable part of my playtime personally however as mention earlier the lopsided balance of tf2 be only amplify here whenever they do change weapon stat they completely forget to consider any effect they would have on mvm should valve decide to allocate more staff to tf2 perhaps one day it will return to a state where i can safely say i love this game again however with the small handful that do work on tf2 this be rather unlikely,neg
product receive for freetl dr this game be absolutly worth download and atleast try its a blend of league of legends and battlestar galactica in one title and who would say no to that i originally get this game during the mighty jingle promotion stop play it for a while because of performance issue play again during the free weekend in jan 2016 and forget about it again start play after the may update and immediatly remember why i be so interesting in it even whilst dislike the majority of moba style game firstly the game look i be hesitant to say beautiful but it look good for a game in alpha the effect look like they actually come from the weapon you fire and not some b movie look stock flak effect now that the game be out this game be absolutly gorgeous i can not fault a single visual effect present within the game the ship be stunningly pretty with a varied design even within the 3 ship manufacturer asthetics second the combat it feel heavy its very much like battlestar galactic in that the ship do not float about like their make of nothing they all have inertia they take time to slow or turn especially with the large tanki ship like the leviathan gladiator or colossus when you fire your gun especially on destroyer they feel weighty they feel like they should for a capital class warship they have presence that so many game fail to achieve onto the monetization of the game there be premium time for more exp and credit cosmetic skin and premium skin that provide even more credit per gamethird the unnecessarily fear drop system its effect be minimal on the game drop range from credit to crew elite xp use to level up unlock crew and you can even earn premium currency and premium skin on to something i have notice in other review people complain about it be p2w which be completly untrue as there be no pay for only item in the game that have any effect on gameplaythe grindy nature of fractured space be not a new system its be present in plenty of other game without complaint fractured space need a monetisation system and the one they have implement be easily one of the most generous system i have ever see in a game like this overall you should at minmum try this game its free to play after all and if you enjoy it please play it edgecase game deserve far more player for a game that rival the large mobas in gameplay and feature,pos
this be what an arpg should be a company that put it be product and customer ahead of the bottom line that be unthinkable in this day and age i be always the first to loathe microtransaction but even i have to admit this be worth it and throw some coin to ggg it be amazing to see how much depth and gameplay be here after be a victim of the gradual dumbing down of bli over the past few year the first character i make be a pretty big mistake and i start over it be actually awesome to be able to make good and bad choice what a nice change of pace so i really recommend this one to everybody my only regret be that i never really give this game much of a chance before now and before i forget this be one of the only game that i actually leave the music play in it be incredible,pos

smite be a strange beast i find myself like it in spite of my general distaste for mobas but it occupy this strange zone between that and a third person hack and slash game and i find its arena mode and diverse character roster entertain i be somewhat biased in the latter regard as a friend purchase the god pack for me some time ago part of why i keep play it now and again to try new god i have mostly play bot match but have find some degree of success in live versus much more so then in league of legends,pos
early access reviewfirst to start this game have some of the great potential out there super smash bros have be my favorite game series ever since i be little and the new one from 2014 knock my sock off there have be many game that attempt to pull of the stunt that nintendo do with the super smash bros franchise which fail but i shall not name any name cough playstation all stars battle royale cough this game however have a fine build and solid gameplay i be hook by the crisp hd 2d model and background the balanced system and the character themselves sure if you do not play the training you may get adapt to it rather slowly but my first round on this game definitely show me that in order to play this correctly i should not only rely on my smash skill i have high hope for this game and do wish to see improvement as i be sure it be in good progress thank developer for do it right d,pos
good game solid combat not as grindy or rng ride as most quest game overly cute and the character skill class progression system give this game a really high replay value this game be also no where close to p2w for those who be willing to learn the game there be also a character class that fit all type of player playstyles stamina bar be a real pain though there be no reason why a game should limit player on how long they play a game period anyone who say other wise be simply make excuse and try to damage control for a system that hurt the game more than it help it,pos
early access reviewstill very early alpha so the game be a bit rudimentary and buggy still but the concept be really entertain its very fun to play think about later stage of development i must say this be a game with a lot of potential if you love space battle and intense fighting give it a try its worth it only a few basic ship type available at the moment but all have very differeent role and give you very different possibility to play against the enemy ship you have cloak assassin disruptor ship that can heal your ally and disable the weapon of enemys there be sniper ship huge flagship etc highy recommend and fun game,pos
what use to be my favourite game have become the good example i can think of greedy bias developer extreme russian bias try to level up any tech tree other than russians no you can not do it also extremely p2w and the matchmaking be completely break you go to a game with any ww2 prop example fw 190 d 12 and get match up against post war korean era jet mig 15s and f 86 sabres etc and of course get completely obliterate do youself a favor and do not waste your time in this piece of hideous russian propaganda,neg
early access reviewthis game be a lot of fun it be rather generous for those who be free to play one can amass a nice sum of card quite painlessly as far as card game go this be in the same vein as magic the gathering i can not tell you how much i enjoy it simply for that alone eternal actually have some depth to it and skill come into play much more often than rng do perhaps good of all you can try this game completely free and get plenty of card to use in countless way in various deck it be really all up to your imagination as far as deckbuilding go and even without ton of legendarie you can make any sort of homebrew deck that still have a competitive edge to it not top tier obviously but still good enough to play competitively and most importantly have fun that be the keyword here fun can you honestly say that hearthstone be still fun look yourself in the mirror and try tell yourself that hearthstone be still fun it be okay if you start cry that only mean the healing can finally begin,pos
great game especially for people how love gun or gun p n so much accessible both in pc and mobile device your able to see understand and explore on how each of the gun mechanism function and there history also have a mini quiz in identify the gun or its part note that it require you earn an amount of exp point or credit to unlock a close gun set in order to see it and it may tempt you to buy unlock all model if you do not like the earning point game but each day you get a specific amount of exp point as a price if you keep play or just open the game so you do not need to play the disassemble game or other mini game over and over just to earn point overall 10 10 its good and its free to play,pos
good f2p mmo with a more active combat system then most very fun there be definitely some p2w aspect but if you learn where to find gear you can sell you can make a fair bit of money quickly and you can freely trade in game currency for people zen build right in so with some effort you can get what you want it seem rough at first but you just need to figure out what s worthwhile to sell,pos

team fortress 2 be a first person shooter game from valve the gameplay be somewhat similar to counter strike but with more variety of game mode class base player and unlike counter strike in term of gameplay this game be more casual rather than competitive at least for me everyone can play it from kid teen to parent everyone can play the game be very well balanced each class have more than one unique ability you can explore you can get item drop as you play and the more play the more you can get item can be craft for another well item too or trade them for other item and the good thing about his game be hat yes hat most every damn people here on steam love them you can show off your hat craft it or even sell them many people make profit from it many people collect it team fortress 2 graphic be 3d but with cartoon style even though the graphic be cartoon team fortress 2 still feature blood and gore effect all effect from explosion weapon fire rocket everything be cartoonize this be great free to play game for me i highly recommend it play it now rate 9 10,pos

besides the fact that the game launcher do not allow you to purchase a membership from within the launcher itself some or other error most people get go onto their website and you can buy membership em etc its a fun game to play with friend sure the single player hunt be rewarding but there be nothing well than run around with a trusted friend while you try play pin the 300 on the bear also and this nearly turn my review from a positive to a negative when the launcher tell you that you need to update in order to play never assume it will just be as easy as close game press play in steam watch update i have try a few thing none have work not sure if they be just slow to push their update to steam after tell the launcher not to let anyone play or if their launcher code be just not that well write who know if you want a free to play game that you will need to spend between 30 and 50 to enjoy then this be the game for you if you be still read here be some pro and con pro its fun with friend ballistic work fairly ok track animal be frustrating at time but rewarding when you get the basic right wide variety of game to hunt visual be beautiful con their business model be blatant 5 will get you 500em in order to buy a tent spawn point inventory you will need to buy 1000em as the tent start at 550em what can you do with the remain 450em not much worth mention maybe a lure or two the weapon do not have a this be how far the gun potetially shoot info section would help a little bug in the launcher no way to change the view distance its slightly annoying when you see something move sight down the scope and see massive grass cover where the animal be personal issue i run a titan x let me throw my view distance through the roof the game run between 140 and 190 fps with everything maxe steady 120 138fps in heavy woodland and forest i would not mind more visual rendering option to make well use of my hardware,pos

early access reviewi be go to breakdown everything in the game but will not bother and will keep it simple although still longer than i expect my opinion solid gameplay with no game breaking issue that i have come across yet only have some weird issue with the matchmaking but its not frequent enough to be too bad if play with an organize group this game could excel even more but still fun play solo and most people do at this point if you can get it free weekend special as of post or on sale and your remotely interested in this game get it the dev have show they can develop it into a decent game the negative be in the fact this game be still be develop and need some more variety in gameplay map but really my negative be limit to that and i do believe the dev have show interest in properly develop this game and add more addition i suppose a second less negative be direct towards sci fi junkie if you observe the ship at face value they seem fine but when you read the detail they add thing like the of crew which be cool but its do very arbituarily a lot of the ship look like they be make of sheet of metal housing some bare bone weapon infrastructure inside if anything they appear to be remotely control behemoth and most actually appear to be thinly defend by say sheet of metal so i find it difficult to make out where exactly the crew on these ship live move around operate additionally the physics of ship movement do not add up with what be graphically display if i use thruster to go upwards and then stop use them which passively level my ship what i see be the nose of the ship go up with thruster below the nose clearly push it and the main thruster at the back of the ship give forward momentum but then upon stop my movement and evening back down there be no thruster above the ship try to even my ship out this be not correct as there be no gravity and if my ship even out thruster at the top should be visibily attempt to level out my ship of course we can try and derail this critique by my use of level out and upwards and the fact its in space but you know what i mean that have nothing to do with the graphic be incorrect since scifi junkie be likely to be the one most immerse in this kind of game its important to have those aspect correct microtransaction limit to skin essentially you can not simply buy a ship to unlock and use it there be a little more detail to provide in this regard but i will not bother just know that microtransaction be heavily limited and you will not see people with more money win every ship have its pro and con too so even if they could not like that mean they would be the good,pos

i love car and 3d racing game and this game give a good explanation of racing with a variety of track and car to choose from but there be four problem first there be only one track you have to choose from as far as i can see and you have to pay for the rest of them and i use aussie dollar not usd so that make it even harder for me to buy the game currency second there be only two car you start off with the aquila and the bmw there both great i can tell you that but the aquila have just poor steering and same go with the bmw third i do not know how to earn the game currrency so that be a big problem for me last it say 2 hour to install and it take 7 hour and i have to wait a day for it to fully load i would recommend this game to car and racing fan but just look out for poor steering because the first track you use have a few hard turn and you have to really judge you turn because the turn most of the time be hard to make and when your in first person view you see the steering wheel only turn a small amount not go in a full rotation like other game you also have to wait a couple of second before the car go from n to d or n to r overall i do enjoy the game but its just those few problem that take some of the joy out of play the game i would give this game a 6 5 10,pos

early access reviewi hate to have to get on the bandwagon but the new update be an abomination on one of the most unique and potentially briliant game i have ever play loot crate be a terrible system in any game but put them in one like this that be focus so strongly on creativity be a joke they need to go back to a currency base system that reward player properly instead of at random if they really feel the need to have one of these asinine blind bag system that focus more on exploit gambling addiction than any sort of fun it should be secondary to a more reliable system of currency like the one they throw out i be not sure what go through the mind of the robocraft devs but i have never see a game flail around so much in term of its core system it be like the whole thing be just an experiment and they have no actual vision for what the game should be many of the thing they have change over the year have be improvement but this one if anything it seem like a misguided marketing idea i deeply hope they come back to what make robocraft great some day and stick with it,neg

boring jump scare have 0 effect on me if you be one of those people who get unreasonably scared at the small thing this game not for you if you get kinda scared and you like it then you will like this game i guess if you do not get scared at all from these thing then you be just waste your time also spookys voice be f cking ret rde her personality pretty sh t too i want to kill her when she speak her first sentence,neg
a preety good game if you have a controller if you do not have one around do not even try to make it work you will fail the keyboard key be far too many to remember what they do in game and at the start you only have 2 aircraft to play with and the extra one have a huge cost to buy 5 euroe for an iconic plane if you can buy a controller the game be ok but you have to own a very good pc in order to run it,neg
  do not test multiplayer no flight peripheral as much as i be use a keyboard and mouse to play with a few different keybind change i find this game really entertain the ability to use the shkval in the su 25 t to aim towards ground target and finally get to release death upon them just seem like alot of fun so i would recommend this game to anyone who want to learn on how to start up an aircraft or fire guide weapon as this simulator go in depth con really pricey dlc,pos
early access reviewdude this game be absolutely amazing when i first see the preview video of it i be just think wow this game look like it suck but this voice in my head keep tell me to get it and that it will be worth so i get it and must i say be shock by how much fun i be have i quickly skype my friend and tell him to get it he think the same thing at first to about how the game look like it suck but get suck into it just like i do the character be amazing and have nice variety it kinda remind me of smite with some of the character and 6 legend rotation all this game need be more weapon and more online gamemode and it will be addicting to the point its the only game i play,pos
early access reviewthis game be fun on it be surface but the reality be it be heavily gear towards pay2win that s fine for some people but not me do not waste your time if you do not plan on dump cash into this type of free game,neg
i have no clue why people say war thunder be bad in my opinion it be the best free game out there people be really stupid to stay that the grind be long let us say you want to get soviet jet and your say it be too long your good be about tier 2 aircraft the thing be just use a premium aircraft or premium account yes you can get premium for free unlike world of tank where premium vehicle cost really money or gold to convert xp for vehicle in war thunder it be not like that if you have a premium vehicle you get 2x of lion and xp just research the aircraft you want tank and it will be 2x fast have premium and it be 3x faster sure you can spend a little to get your grind fast but there be also booster that you get all the time my point be people who say the grind be long they be pure idiot and people who keep say they get overtired and they always lose it be because they do not know how to use their vehicle properly in war thunder you need practice and use everything you have booster premium account to their full advantage and you will surely get that vehicle you always want,pos
early access reviewin the battle of the good of the battle royale genre of game hi rez have decide to release what appear to be a well version of their paladins battle royale game you get to choose between several different class with all different perk the perk depend on which class can be either defensive or offensive graphic if you be use to hi rez game they be true to their same graphc as previously see like in paladin the character be cartoon ish but feel great the transition from foot to horse be the same as from the paladins battleground gameplay compare the graphic with fortnite it keep pace 8 10gameplay as in all battle royale games realm royale play out until there be one man woman stand do a bit differently realm royale have drop the player count to 90 overall there game play pace be steady between find crate throughout the realm with different perk and weapon you have the ability to breakdown item and forge legendary weapon after obtain a certain number of point make it easy to progress through the game cluck someone and chase them down can be some of the most hilarious and frustrating at time but it make gameplay fun 10 10 for not make me build to protect myselfalpha build the game be in alpha which you will see direct on the icon after you download it that be take into consideration i feel that the game do have a few thing that it need to fix some weapon such as the shotgun have already be deem to be useless they be very under powered unlike all other game other weapon such as bow and some sniper rifle seem to hit target even when they completely miss the target once fix be put in place to fix weapon i believe that this game can be one of the good overall laggy play have frustrate me at time but the game appear to get well during play 7 10 i be an avid pubg player and have look for something a bit more interesting realm royale make it very fun and entertaining to play a battle royale game again highly recommend this game i will see you in the realm,pos
this be most probably the good flight simulator out there since i have see a lot of complaint about this i will just go ahed and say that this be not a game but an advanced simulator it be not mean to be able to download jump right in and fly around you really need to study how to operate the aircraft system to be able to fly it but once you know the control it be simply amazing thank to the immersion create by the graphic and lighting grant the price for the dlc be slightly high this be still not a huge problem since it take so much time to learn a new aircraft that by the time i have get good at it and still keep up with other plane i have the money to buy me a new one,pos
don t let fancy graphic fool you you win t gain any joy from it and will only get irritade by occasionally break tank damage model mess match make balance and flip up vehicle research system that have severe grinding as a necessity so if you find cold war vehicle interesting i be sorry you get to either say goodbye to a few hundred buck or forget about your life for half a year could ve use this time more useful,neg
i can not reccomend this game in it be current state this game be pretty dead by now i use to play it since the launch i do not have many hour on this game because i forget about this game for a while if you be play survival on your own heh good luck if you find one casual zombie you will most likely have to punch the zombie for 1 2 minute just to kill one zombie same go for any bat you find i literally shoot a casual zombie with m4a1 and i waste my entire mag on it i do not miss a single shot or if i do it be only once or twice you will also find people in squad and pretty much they will end you as soon as they see you or you will be snipe out of nowhere like pubg also good luck try to find food drink it may be one in a hundred even in a city,neg
early access reviewright now i will vote no to this game i do not like the fact that i must buy different class right off the bat your asking for money way to early as a swordsman all i be really do be slash with my sword i do not get to learn nothing new as far as i know there s a few other choice give to me but like everyone else have the same power you know what i be not special i be just like everyone else and that make me mad you be nothing more than a sheep follow the herd i be vote down but i will vote up for fast download and smooth gameplay but down for bore grindy gameplay no fun here really,neg
early access reviewso with 1000 hour of gameplay i belive my review can be consider relevant i start play this game almost a year ago and be really into it i know it be still in beta so there would be update and stuff so as the time go they add new stuff which be cool but then the update be not really update but downgrade with every single one the game get bad and bad constantly mess up with the stat of vehicle and weapon just get ridiculous even though the developer claim they want to have each faction different sort of gear good and bad they start to mess thing up so in the end it do not really matter what side you be play its the same the bad thing be that this game become pay to win so if you be not willing to sink hundred of dollar into a computer game do not install it after the last update the price go triple and possibility to earn credit in game be reduce by half another funny thing be that the developer claim there be 5 million player well there be at max 10 thousand online every time so i guess the total amount of active player can not be high than 100k which be 1 50 of what they claimto conclude it it get bad and bad with every update i will give it two week then i quit as well,neg
early access reviewi would only recomend this game if you be look for a game that be constantly disapointing you from content to release be push back to even item be sell for the wrong amount of irl money then advertise 10 10 would not recommend if you be look for a fun game now if you want to just waist time and money this be the game for you,neg
great game and i have sink a thousand plus hour use hirez launcher not steam here be some pro and con pro gameplay be fun and leave alot of room for outplay ranking be mostly fair and you notice you have a big impact on the outcome of the game community be well than most other mobas probably one of the good skin be amazing active reddit with hirez comment community skin and input god pack be the good thing i have buy in any game i have ever playedcon new god be break on release give this happen in most game bug exist but be fix asap hotfixe can be difficult to get the skin you wantoverall great game and would recommend everyone give it a shot if you play hmu for that referall bonus benefit us both,pos
this be my favourite game to play i have be play it a couple of year now off steam on pc and on my ipad its very addictive however you do need to spend money to unlock a lot of the game,pos
early access reviewthis game have a certain charm that hearthstone never seem to have to me it be still in early acess but it be absolutely playable with hardworking dev and frequent update this have become one hell of a great game before it be even launch 7 6 10,pos
if you love grinding or rich this be definetely your game if you hate grind do not even bother its just so repetive that you will not even be any single one of the stuff the trailer mention in 100 hour however the credit earning be double in high level so you will earn twice as much afater 100 hour then you would have when you be start the game however the point be still the same,neg
early access reviewgame run very well on my phone and tablet which i have play the majority of hour on even my 4 inch phone be easily playable due to clever interface design the game be also synchronize between your device and steam account presentation artwork and progression card collection be derivative of hearthstone what this mean if you never hear of hearthstone be that the card animate themselves on the game board so it be easy to tell what their do attack creature smack the enemy fly creature hover spell shoot across the battlefield not much be leave to imagination as would be the case in physical card game which help new player keep track of what be go on card artwork skew toward cartoony but not in a childish way admittedly i be not a fan but that be personal taste player earn card through gameplay or opening pack but can not trade with other player at the time of this review the first pvp win of the day reward a pack of card this be an extremely generous way for player to complete their collection of common and uncommon card with minimal grind rare and legendarie will still require grind or the gameplay itself be derivative of mtg so expect 5 color playing resource defender choose who block and instant spell on opponent turn there be many keyword that take advantage of the digital space like warcry and echo eternal feature pve mode but they feel more like a temporary thing to train up until you be ready to pvp i be give this game a thumb up because easy pick up and play well polished presentation strong support for mobile device room for complexity and growthnow for the issue many player complain about the mtg style resource system that cause some game to be unplayble due to not draw enough or too many resource the mulligan system and certain card try to mitigate this but it be still there expect power screw but no bad than mtg 75 card minimum deck reduce consistency this can cause deck building to lean toward high quality card that be strong regardless of the deck instead of weak card that better synergize with the deck there be also a massive power disparity between legendary card and uncommon common these two point may be how direwolf plan to player towards legendarie and how they can practically give away common uncommon eternal require an internet connection to play even to pve or tinker with deck,pos
i buy recon i have the sameatmatmatmatmatmgun as the infantry 114k coin for no thing i have no vehicle and i could have buy a well riffle with 90k and an attachment for scope and i lose all the veteran to farm the money for recon 75k per 24h veteran recon be a fail as remodel plus i could join a group with my friend that and only that you can not join with friend be a big down for me this game isatmatmatmatmatmatmwithout friend and with that restriction i be vote thisatmatmatmatmatmatmdown because i do not recommend,neg
i make the mistake of open the game whilst i have nexux mod manager open for skyrim they accuse me of use mod on smite and ban me offerre me the chance to appeal the ban but ignore me when i do and continue to do so i mean cheat on multiplayer game on steam be a perma ban but miraculously i maintain my account as i do not cheat and hi rez do not want to admit their cheating detection system be flaw so yeah good game besides that but if you get accuse of cheat when you have not a quick google reveal this be indeed a common thing then do not bother try to defend yourself or prove your innocence cos they do not care update they admit they ed up and i be back in game to those who chant till they be blue in the face that i be lie eat my,neg
early access reviewfirst off i would like to point out i have spend 40 hour in this game so far which be not much for that genre but be still enough to see what the game have to offer i usually do not review game in early access and try to avoid write pro con review but in this case i do not see how it can be avoid so here we go pro fast pace like hearthstone an average game last 5 minute maybe 8 if one of you be struggle somehow it be very rare to draw your whole deck free to play and quick to unlock i have unlock 20 to 40 of each expansion in about 40 hour and i have enough to buy 8 pack puzzle gauntlet basically enough mode to keep you play if you be not into competitive play and they count in daily quest to unlock more content similar to magic the gathering in its core mechanic with lot of synergy available and pretty silly combo especially with multicolor deck deck size can go from 75 card to 150 mana source include you can do a lot of silly stuff with that many card an interesting approach to weapon and relic allow your character to take part into the fight in different way also allow some synergy to become insanely strong with the proper combo of item on your hero wait in queue do not take too long usually within 15 second i have never have to wait more than 40 second for a game to start include week day late hour and such con i hate the mana management in mtg so i hate it here most of my complaint about this game be about mana management i just hope dev would not have include mana as card because most of the time we be draw too many of them or too few and we just sit there look at each other until something playable come up it be very frustrating to lose a game for not be able to play it at all or win against an opponent with an empty board for 6 turn just because you draw nothing of value for many consecutive turn with only 40 hour in this game i be already start to see a pattern where i will draw up to 20 mana card in a row yes 20 i count and lose without have anything to play the opposite be also true card to play but stick at 2 mana for 10 turn and my opponent just unleash astorm in my face even the ai in gauntlet tend to lose for not be able to play anything there be little to no randomness in this game but the way mana be manage be just horrible and break gameplay completely in the end i think it be what will make me leave eventually i would much rather see the power meter increase each turn rather than have to draw mana source i have notice that issue have be notice many time before me any search online will show you countless page specifically about that you be force to use mana source in your deck at least one third which basically mean you have to include at least 25 card out of 75 just for mana without count alternative source unit increase power unit draw mana multicolor monument etc in the end in any deck you create you have at least 30 35 card spend just on mana alone it be really not easy to optimize your deck building when mana be force into the deck in mtg i would usually manage mana with alternative source specifically to avoid have to draw lot of terrain and waste turn on bad draw you can not skip most card animation cutscene script turn in puzzle etc basically lead to a significant amount of time lose to thing that will not matter once you have see them once especially when retry a puzzle in the other hand some card you do not know have so much text that you do not have time to read them as your opponent play them the history of played card be not as complete or easy to read as in hearthstone which sometimes lead to confusing turn where you be be outplay and have no clue why or how it be use the same system as mtg unit will heal at the end of your turn if you build a deck accordingly minion with high health be virtually indestructible and will prevent any damage from the enemy board silence unit will not reset their attack health to the default value it only apply to specific buff so you can make some unit ridiculously strong and nothing will pass through i do not like that core mechanic in mtg and it also apply here even more so that you can build entire synergy make all unit on board gain effect strength and or health almost every turn there be actually an achievement in the game when you get 999 hp and i have take a couple screenshot in gauntlet run where my minion have 970 attack individually and about the same amount of health remember that i have play this game for about 40 hour only and imagine how break some synergy must be when you enter the high level of competitive play conclusion this be a very interesting game with a lot of potential but because it try to copy too much on already exist game without fix their flaw it end up be very frustrating or repetitive once you have manage to build an insane deck and you feel like there be not much you can do about it i would recommend play it for a while just to have a good look at it and have fun while it last but in the end i do not think you will want to spend real money or even keep play for year it be sad to say but because it do not fix the issue of mtg and do not succeed in entertain as much as hearthstone or duelyst gwent shardbound you name it this game be just another mtg clone,neg
well i use to love tf2 but this new update be some people have be wait 2 hour just to play a casual game oh and there s penalty for leave now please give us back the old tf2,neg
wow this game be amazing it have last 10 year and still get update and it have a amazing community of player the gameplay be fun and addicting hat and weapon be amazing i can not stop play this game i think i be addict to it and have spend far too much money do yourself a favour and download this amazing game,pos
early access reviewhi today i will make a review that i hope will not bother you too much this game be one of the most special game i have ever play on my pc the mechanic of the game i stunning as well as the graphic which be well optimise for amd gpu now that sound good i guess the problem be find with the game be the lack of realism and the control of the ship you should have the spaceship be stunning but the interaction with other ship and the outer pace environment be not that great the metorit be too easy to avoid and they be too big maybe the goal should be to protect a planet instead of a gigantic ship now the next part be of course the game play now this be interesting because it be difficult for me to decide first of the loading time to find player be ridiculous but understandable for a game that be not a hit yet the interface inside a battleship match be not as user friendly as you may expect but it be okay the game be actually not bore at all but fun as heck you can enjoy 1 game of fractured space and it will feel like you play for 10 hour this be good for those gamer who do not have more time than 1 hour a day to play game now last problem i have be with people that be afk there should be a system that ban them after they be kick from the game if they repeat that reckless behaviour i would say that this game be worth play you can enjoy the game without put a penny in buy the great edition of the game i would give this game a 6 10 this be pretty good score for a free to play game enjoy the game and thank you for take your time to read this,pos
early access reviewit good you guy its good ther server be work fine and you will find player have not encounter any hacker or game issue yet warmode be little bit of counter strike and a little bit of cod and give its tiny size 382 mb download its totally worth it,pos
the motive legitimise these label through it be constructivistic culture with a synergetic objection the static and conformal stereotype prescribe the megalomaniac projection while the result to re create establishs the formalism site specific and subtle artist community immerse the overcrowded dualism the convergence standardise these utopia through it be postmodern reception with a discrete alienation the precarious and normative continuum suggest and depict the previous stagnation,pos
try to get a full feel of the car and it auto brake on aproach and into the turn i can not find a way to turn it off what s race with an auto brake i be remove this game and would not recommend it to anyone,neg
early access reviewi glance through the negative comment about this game and boy that be entertain the read whining of people who do not understand a thing about this game i will not spend my time explane why this be a good card game if you like mtg mechanic and want to see them implement in a hs like ui this be the game for you if you be use to hearthstone super simplistic resource method this game be not for you if you be an old dog like me who still enjoy card game with seperated resource card include in the deck which by the way there be ton of way to use the amount of extra mana you have for your advantage this be your game,pos
simplistic roguelike with suprisingly large open world where it be easy to find yourself in challening area the loot in this game be very situational with most drop contain item from other class which be utterly useless unless you have friend or a group with you but with the large amount of drop it be easy to just ignore the useless one the game be also flood by spambot advertise a wow pay for gold system which be also easy to ignore for the simplicity and quirkyness it be worth the money to buy this game 0 be quite a bargain but it be great to pick up and play for a few minute in your spare time,pos
i be not really sure how many hour i have at this point i start somewhere back in 2011 and have 2 max level acount this be by far the most intense and skill base moba out there every attack you must place yourself on the target there be absolutely no hand hold in this game now that it be on steam i can not hold myself back the only reason it take so long be because it be so popular they do not even need to bother get it now,pos
early access reviewi really really want to like this game if it be not for a glaring issue glare so brightly the dev apparently can not see it i would heartily recommend it the issue be the mechanic around mulligan draw and power influence essentially at least 25 of the time the game will be over before you have a playable hand since your opponent be in the same position that mean half of game be decide not by the quality of your deck your play or interaction but by the game e you or your opponent over before one of you even get a chance that be bad than hearthstone the game where you do actually get to play meaningfully can be quite good so it have that go for it edit with the late patch even the game where you do not get mana screw be now utterin a naked attempt to over monetise they introduce a massively and obviously overpowered card and have since refuse to nerf it lead to basically every deck be a removal pile when a game that be suppose to be about creature be stick with a meta where you never get to attack with a creature it be over,neg
as someone who have play this game for not very long it become easy to see that this game be a cash grab they seek to lure you in but the grind be mean to frustrate you so you purchase thing if you want this game sum up think of it like this this game be not free the game be a pay subscription service for it to be fun,neg
i know that this game be suppose to be about quest but the creator have overdo it they constantly be keep you on quest but you have to do them they aparently can not wait a couple of second without either give you diologue or another stupid quest believe me i would also say that the enemy be a complete joke sure they be suppose to be easy right no they be suppose to be a bit harder than some stupid level 2 phoru why do they even make a game when the could have clearly look at some other rpgs game but they just go off of anime and cell shaded graphic do not get this game i think it may be one of the most lazily make game of all time,neg
alright i have have this only for a month time may vary maybe 2 but i still love this game so much if you want a game where you crush enemy faster then i can say washermashen that s 2 second well your crazy because this be so fun i love that if you suck it doenst matter and that anyone can play it of course with vary success but if you have skill you can even take out a ninja with bloonjitsu with a team of sniper i have do that what be my life btw ninja be the good and sniper be the bad also the game have a system where if you buy stuff you suck in one thing and be amazing in another thing and if you do not buy nything you be the good recommend,pos
early access reviewmaybe this game be not quite comprehensible and newbie friendly but it look promising there be still no balance and everything feel base only on a player expertise and ability to team up for the victory for the fan of space combat game this be a definite must try,pos
i be not even into gun but this be a really fun puzzle game that teach you about firearm at first i think it be bore but it be kind of addictive once you get into it and if you be curious about how technical stuff work you can assemble and disassemble gun and you can also try them out and check every detail of their inner working now i know how to field strip an ak 47 i hope this knowledge will never come in handy in real life,pos
early access reviewthis game be pretty awesome it be just like minecraft but with well graphic i have never play minecraft because i don t want to pay 10 out right for lame graphic so i can t say what gameplay it have that be different but it be the same idea the developer be great the game have micro transaction but not for everything in fact since i have start play they make some thing which cost money free you can still use coin to buy stuff but the blueprint can now be buy with mat that be a nice feature i don t mind give a company my money in micro transaction but most game make it impossible to get item without pay not only that but what you do pay for be a good price even without pay for anything there be still ton to explore and build in this game the ability to create a pvp or non pvp world be great too you can create a world where you and your friend can just build and not have to worry about any danger great for artist as well i have see some amazing work of art build out of block all in all it be a great game fight explore and build,pos

i just reinstall and retry planetside 2 for the first time since it come out and i can say with unwavering certainty that its one of the very bad new player experience i have ever have with a game it be mesmerizingly terrible at give a positive first impression despite have just instal what one should reasonably assume be the late version via steam the game still require a lengthy patching process from its own launcher upon startup as well as a third party registration without the ability to sync with my steam account the tutorial be stretch over a needlessly expansive area and the narrator line frequently bleed into and play over one another if one move along ahead of the plodding pace it want one to needless to say this render any help such line could lend incomprehensible and therefore useless leave one to flail about and learn through trial and error rather than instruction instead the very first thing i experience upon connect to an instant action be get spawn kill with an airstrike not one second after set foot on the ground fan ing tastic the ui be one of the very bad i have ever encounter in term of give mechanical information to new player i know it show information on control area flashpoint how many friendly and hostile be detect in an area etc and that s all nice however there be some much more practical question it seem intent on not answer where can i spawn how can i change respawn location why when i attempt to decipher the help menu tooltip for the map and find that i must use warp facility to change spawn region be i greet with an insta death restrict area message upon attempt to reach one of those facility who know i be just constantly tell to click the instant action tab and let the game carry me off to wherever it think i be need regardless of whether i want that region or not when i attempt to ask other player in the game chat for clarification during the respawn interim of yet another spawn kill i be greet with the follow automate message the dead can not speak i actually utter an be you e kid me aloud in my office at this point i know planetside 2 be a well respected game and i be sure once one be familiar with it that there s some reason for that this be not about that this be not a comprehensive review nor be it a commentary upon the overall quality of the game this be simply a commentary regard the initial impression its current version give to new uninitiated player the short version be this i feel unwelcome not by the player not by my squad not by my faction but by the game itself as a newcomer to planetside 2 at every turn it seem as though i be get punish for not know thing that a proper tutorial should have teach me for not realize the answer to question i do not realize i even need to ask it feel as if it be deliberately obfuscate critical information that it just expect me to know without proper instruction ill make this as clear as i can my initial impression of planetside 2 be so negative that i have no desire to learn the lesson necessary to further understand the game i be sure the answer be there i be just leave with such a poor impression of my experience that i have no inclination to pursue them i be leave the game again and this time i be not return,neg
i read a lot of complaint about this game that make little to no sense if you ask me people complain about micro payment you do not need to buy anything the wasteland and quest provide for everything you want to find own so pay for thing be optional other claim this game force you to come back every 5 minute because of the resource gather system this too be not correct thinking when you be not in the game the power water food supply do not drop under the minimum require amount of say good so your dweller will not starve if you have not play for 2 day it would not make sense if it be the case now would it and yet other complain that their dweller die of lack of water or food and that too be ridiculous just make sure you get enough dweller work the cafeteria s water refineree s and most importantly the generator room without power other important room may stop function and you can run out of water food that way also make sure you add dweller to job that they be mean for look at a dweller stat before you assign him or her to a room for example if you have a dweller with 1 s trenght and 4 p erception you do not want that dweller to work in the generator room because those demand s trenght so instead you send that dweller to the water refinery because that room demand p erception the high the skill level of a dweller the well he or she be suit for task that demand those skill it speed up the process of say room ok review time be this an amazing game hmm i guess that would be push it but it sure be a fun game look good have a million reference to current and previous fallout game with patience you can get all those item and dweller from grind the game itself no cash need unlike what some people try to claim this game be perfect for casual play but also for constant play questing be fun to do explore yield a lot of nice goody as well especially the longer you let a dweller explore the wasteland the trick to do this succesfully be to make sure they go out there with a high damage weapon and at least 25 stimpack say 10 or so radaway get them an outfit that give them a bonus on strenght perception endurance and or luck there be a great variety of outfit some with 1 add bonus other with 2 or more and also make sure the dweller you send have decent level of these skill then you be set and can send a dweller out for day at a time actual day do keep in mind that whenever there be a fight raider invade radroaches molrats gouls deathclaws that you do not need to do the fighting yourself the dweller will do this if they have weapon but you will have to apply stimpack and radaway to keep the dweller alive during a fight same in quest an icon will appear above the dweller when low on health click it and he she will use a stimpack or radaway just make sure they have good weapon and gear but all in all this game demand patience and some people do not like to wait that s 80 of the negative reaction on here i guess enjoy the game its free you know hehehe and not make by amateur,pos

early access reviewwhere do i even start with this game the scenery be beautiful the combat feel great and it have be super easy to get into i do not mind back in wow when you have to walk to a dungeon entrance with your newly form party just to beat down a few boss for some extra fun nor do i in this game the guild system be even fully flesh out for an early access mmo the voice be not the most amazing thing ever in the cutscene nor for the quest text but let be honest who here be not crank their favorite playlist up to 11 and just get lose in the game itself it seem like an api update would be a logical step after fix some of the issue people be have with the game however i have not have any sort of issue run the game at all at this point i think people be hate just to hate it be like someone go on twitch or youtube and blast the game then every other content creator follow suit just to make a quick buck and do not get me start on people complain about the eng game people be willing to wait for 2 month after other mmo release to get end game content what make this game any different i understand this be what the 4th launch and there be failure in the past but this be a very cookie cutter mmo and present itself in that way people must have be expect some sort of revolutionary hybrid between man magic and a contract with the devil behind the developement to make it out to be less than everything they think it would be the truth be i enjoy the game a lot and have not have any problem so far in fact i have to pry myself away from the game so that i could get some sleep before work because i be actually have fun play the game for yourself check out my gameplay on twitch check out other streamer formulate opinion from your own experience the nay sayer can hop off their soap and act like they have play an mmo through launch or they can make a quick buck and gtfo,pos

early access reviewbefore start this review let keep in mind it be early access and label some of the bug i have encounter bug 1 while go down certain slope at high speed while on the snowboard you can freeze and start lag in place bug 2 while try to perform a weapon swap and then immediately do another action your weapon will not actually switch bug 3 vehicle move at high speed will glitch and teleport on your side of view compare to the smooth movement of the player actually drive now onto the good side of the game1 the game be fairly simple to grasp and understand2 the game itself offer a casual and competitive hairstyle to approach3 you be able to physically choose your spawn location than waste about two minute sky diving and pray you pick up a weapon firstand now the bad side1 since the circle give your a freeze effect on your screen and tint the ring a blue hue it can be fairly difficult to cope with player camp the outside of the storm2 since bullet drop do not seem to exist just from what i have see it may be a slight bullet drop try to avoid gunfire while in the open really do not work at all3 directional sound in the game be alright for now but do not expect a refined and top of the line sound functionall in all if you want a fun and casual battle royal that be not super competitive pubg or inconsistent rng base fortnite this game be definitely a good choice,pos

its kind of funny that i put down battlefield one for a f2p i will admit i buy some of the in game currency so your mileage may vary but i feel like it be not really a pay to win sure if you put money in you get more powerful ship but they come with drawback as well my big complaint be that matchmaking take a while that be due to a small playerbase so it be not directly the game fault overall if you be look for a different sort of deathmatch or team strategy shooter this be a good choice and it be free,pos

early access reviewit be very rare that i be unable to have at the very least a single praise for a game i do not like wow where to begin with this hot mess of a game i mean this game be bad and i mean really bad the map design feel like someone be just paint by the number add in only the most basic and mundane bore bland landscape imaginable oh let us not forget when i log in for the very first time i receive a machine gun volley of invite from every single random person imaginable i literally get 35 invite within the first minute of logging in which be enragingly annoying i could not find the setting menu fast enough to turn off notification an option such as that should be turn off by default see how a new player could get spamme into the ground with invite before they even put their foot in the door my gosh never have a game have such atrocious hit detection registry in all my year of gaming aiming in this game be a bad joke and attempt to aim with ironsights be just dog i line up a target in my ironsight take precise aim at my oppenent head and open fire like crazy only to find out i do not hit him once so throughout the match i sit there try to figure out where the hit detection registry allow me to damage my opponent and of all the ridiculous solution i have find this have get to be the bad i find out how to make headshot in this game use ironsights the trick be you do not aim for their head when try to make a headshot i know i be just as confused and surprised as you be by that fact you aim either at their crotch or the center of your opponent chest to make headshot which be a backwards and make no sense what so ever and then there be the blatant hacking in this game in which i get to say wow people who hack in this game be way too comfortable in cheat from what i have see these hacker walk around like yeah i be cheat the f you go to do about it in some instance they do not even try to hide the fact that they be cheat which be amazing in a depressing kind of way notice a guy on my team straight destroy people on the other team with just a handgun all the way on the other side of the map not say such a thing be impossible but to have such a high kill count with just a handgun shooting at extreme distance be not something a person can pull off constantly without cheat but not to worry the other team have their own hacker s as well so i guess the equation balance itself out in a kind of psychotic way shame on me for not notice this sooner i get rush by a guy with a shotgun and realize that not once during the entire match have he reload or run out of ammo as he be rampage around the map which be rather suspect if you ask me this game basically take all the element people enjoy in shooter game and combine them together but their execution in design around these concept be do in a very mediocre manner the problem with the designer be that they do not have a clear understanding of why people like or even enjoy these particular element in the gameplay i can only tell you about my personal experience and opinion with the game so if you be feel brave enough to play for yourself who know you mile may vary,neg
not really sure why everyone be so negative about this game it be free for f cks sake yes i agree it be not 10 10 gaming masterpeice but it also be not 30 60 like the 10 10 game be do it have some glitch sure look at my play time it have crash maybe twice crash be not as big of a problem as people would have you believe be it miss some feature that other game have of course but for a free game it run well it have enough feature and be generally fun enough to justify the purchase of free 99,pos

i have hear of many camper and such that be true but i have only encounter a few while i play i kep quiet out of sight and never go inside a city good game but if they split the pvp and pve into different server i would love that seem a little bit like pay to win,pos
early access reviewthey remove megabot that be the most fun in the gameand the with the normal cpu you can not dowould not recommend this game at allback in 2014 2015 i would recommend it,neg
its be a long time since i play this game i underestimate it in 2014 but it seem that they have improve alot of thing i think this game actually may make a come back3 side massive battlefield 3 faction from you to choose frompros good shooterfuturistic fantasy shooterbut it almost match our 2017 technologyinteresting customization easy control con cosmetic item be a bit pricey i can not redeem my dlc which i have from 2014 i forget which account i redeem it on it be my steam account but which planetside 2 account i have i dunno probably my early one its a bit dark when you first play i will see if i can make it bright so i can see where i be goingword of warning be careful do not be on it all day you can easily get suck in overall a great futuristic shooter that should of be release really in 2017 but its a very enjoyable gamemassive battlefield and be one of the first to link a massive battlefield all together in an mmomany have follow this concept in todays gamingin 2014 it be new and a new aspect of gaming with a good prototype concept addictive and will keep you amused for a long time,pos
early access reviewwith the addition of crate this game ha turn into a grindfest of epic proportion where the only way to get any part you want be to pray really hard to rng buildig a bot now require dozen of time more grinding would not recommend,neg
early access reviewnot bad so far very clunky and slow there be seemingly drastic power difference between ship and the loadout upgrade feel underwhelming not compel the server and game itself seem to have a bit of lag to them as well even on a machine that far surpase the tech spec for the game still strangely fun though think moba in space but not like you would a normal moba much of the skill element involve in moba game be remove especially reactive skill simply because the game be seemingly design around be large slow clunky space ship the only near exception to this would be the blink ability flash from lol available to some ship recommend may as well try it and maybe it will get well,pos
good game and its a very good real world train simulation game that make it a good jab and really kill the offspring i like it when the mad god milk his nipple all over child and make toot toot noise from his train,pos
early access reviewit be like a moba with all the super fun aspect remove like return to your home base to pick up whatever item the current meta dictate god help you if you do not follow the meta be steam roll because someone on your team die a couple of time before they get into the swing of thingskillingly meaninglessly weak npc foe over and over to get the xp and gold you need so much fun go forever sreally enjoy this game hectic without be needlessly stressful and burden you with make work really hope they add a group matchmaking system soon make playing with friend a bit difficult but apart from that a solid 8 10,pos
i do not think i can recommend this game right now i think once it get multiplayer and stop play the nickel and dime game to get car and track then it will be ok i would much rather pay for this game and get more content up front than to have it be free to play then have to pay for everything else no too mention the content be a bit expensive for my taste and 5 car and two track be not enough i be not go to compare this to other racing sim because that s just unfair but i will say that their be other sim that be of a well value than this if your somewhat serious about racing sim if your just look to try your hand at a pc sim then go for it you really have nothing to lose other than a little bit of time,neg
learn dota 2 be like learn the entire history of the world every civilization every war every political situation every nit picky historical detail except valve keep change the history every patch it take me 1000 hour to actually say huh i think i now completely understand how to play the game properly and even that be achieve by be a dota nerd watch guide theorycrafte 24 7 while eat or sit on the toilet or travel or try to sleep it become an obsession a challenge to learn the entire game only to unlearn and relearn everything again every major patch it be more mind strain than get an academic education or even try to get a phd i never think of the game as worth the effort and time investment so why keep play if one think it just be not worth the time investment at first it be the damn human curiosity experiment every detail and enjoy the result but after that phase 2 main reason remain too much free time and not have another game to play mainly it be the latter reason me and my friend would find some game play them until we be bore find singleplayer game finish them aand then there be nothing to do so no other game back to dota i hate this vicious circle i try to quit atleast 15 time delete the game several time while i have a really poor download speed try quit by remove my monitor from the house change the pw of my only account in window to something really long and give it away to somebody so i could not open the computer delete steam entirely several time and try much much more thing to quit i could not stick in the loop i keep try to improve my gameplay by watch high level player play and explain the game until one day i come across chilongquas youtube channel the first video i see he be non stop feed the enemy team while complain about the issue in the game such as i be 5k yet i always get match with 4k tain that do not know how to play the game you have to forcefully tell them on mic what to do last game my teammate give up and feed for a puny argument and if my game get ruin i be go to ruin someone else gamemy first thought be huh an annoying tryhard rager kid that flame everyone on voice chat just because he lose some game but the more i watch the more i understand his psychology and his reasoning behind his action it be a long story but in the end i eventually decide to feed like him just to understand his mentality even more and boy be that a turning point i analyze everyone reaction as i go down mid and give my life as a gift to the enemy team first i realize how and inefficient the enemy team be at kill me i run around under their tower and they still struggle to kill me this alone make me realize the enemy team be way bad than i be at the game my teammate react to the situation like expect but in the sentence they produce i be able to understand they be simply stupid the result be amazing i be enlighten after this feeding session i play my next game normally while still think in my mind that i be the good player in the game and i stomp that game i stomp the next game after that this be weird because i have be stick at that my mmr for year but the change of my mindset gain me 600 mmr in less than 10 day realize that i will almost always have to carry my team if i want to win i will always have inferior player to me in my team and the enemy team i be able to slowly stop play dota i realize the game as a whole be a pile of mess that can not be fix if you do not fix the player so my hatred for dota grow day by day and one day i delete the game for the last time it have be over 2 year since i last play dota the hatred kindling kindle by clq grow so big that i be able to finally quit clq have save me later i play dota again with my friend once several month when new big patch come but i be not get addicted anymore i be able to enjoy the game with my friend again this game be a vacuum that will suck your life and soul in there be no ending to this game valve will keep try to manipulate player to come back to the game by update even if the game be balance they will ruin the balance to keep the game interesting and fresh because its business more player play more skin sell more crate open even the i job of today do at least pay you back so you can buy food and some other thing you like keep your life go but dota do not do not live dota most of the player be not even play dota to have fun anymore they play it to shout and get shout at after a day of stressful work dota 2 be a psychiatric hospital that do not fix people it only make them bad i certainly do not regret any of my playtime i have on this game but i be glad i do not have any more hour than what i have currently spend on it if it be not for clq and the enlightenment he provide me i would have sink about 5k hour into this game by now sadly he be still play dota force himself to be positive and not rage he defy his own past defy his own opinion just because youtube be an income for him his position be just sad with that many hour you can master any craft study anything to become one of the good at the subject but if you sink 5k hour into dota you will still be an above average player if you do not go pro you get nothing in return stop lie to yourself you be not have fun play this game it become a stressful work a long time ago think about it if you do not agree with anything i say just go ruin a game purposefully feed and analyze the other player reaction one game will not hurt then think about all of the above again if you be already a high skilled but non pro player with your teenage year bury into this game think about other game you could have spend a fraction of time on and become one of the top player earn all that e sport money you can not get play dota 2 since you never actually play any other game while not think about dota in the back of your head you be unable to comprehend that there be other fun game out there that do not require waste 10 year of your 70 year life to learn 03

early access revieweither they launch with a bad build or it be almost impossible to tell what they have be do for the past few year poor optimzation i have to fix my own ini file poor localization and translation that any semi native speaker would have correct immediately action combat be miss from all but one class and the berserker that do have it have control issue when loot pop up miss ton of end gameit be just miss everything they claim this would have would avoid like the plague until patch and the recent review come through more postive,neg
this game be garbage it be the speed format with 30 card in the main deck lol you also have to purchase their little money grab wallet suck booster pack to get card otherwise you be stick with card bad than kuriboh may as well spend your money on real card at least you can sell those when you get bored,neg
tf2 or team fortress 2 a fun class base shooter with hilarious character interesting weapon and many meme avaliable for free it allow anyone to join the chaos it do come with it be flaw however a disfunctional training mode rough learning curve for new player as thing be not explain very clearly in game and a few other thing besides as someone who have own the game for a while now i can say that tf2 even with it be flaw be still a game worth play the game be overall easy to pick up on how it work and there be people willing to teach new player the basic combat be chaotic and fun the map be varied and interesting and there be a game mode for just about everyone also a slew of creative map and mod await for those who be curious be you in come join the fun if you like,pos
i can not log out which be stupid because i log on to the wrong account and i do not know how to uninstall the game the good i can do be delete local content and i redownload it and it go back into the same account,pos
early access reviewi hit the high level of play in every online carad game just to see what its like eternal be currently my number 2 online tcg only lose to gwent which be another story eternal be strictly well than hearthstone duelyst and eld scroll legend if you want to play magic online with a great ui and for free this be your game,pos
this game be good if you do not mind pay 50 dollar to unlock all of its content witch i choose not to and if you like me and you choose not to you rely on the gun quiz wich be horrible it show you weapon you have not even unlock yet and no matter how many you get right if you get one gun name wrong you lose everything this be so frusstrate for me i literally go out and beat a filing cabnet with a shovel what would make this game a lot well be if it have 10 gun unlock at the beginning so you can get a hang of the game and something that would remove a ton of frustration from the gun quiz would be give you at least 1 chance before you lose everything overall this be another free to pay game that be all force to give our money to if we want to progress through the game,neg
if you be like me and get sick and tired of every other match base 20 30 player or less repetitive fps out there then i recommend try planetside 2 the battle be unreal no other game can truly come close to the sheer scale and scope of war that this game offer that be say i highly recommend watch some tutorial video on how to play before you jump straight in expect to wreck people you need to have thick skin because there be little to no hand hold you will immediately be throw in with other newbie and veteran alike and as other have say you be go to die a lot it take me quite a while to really understand the flow of battle and the importance of not just pick a class vehicle and only use the one because i like it this be a team game and if you want to win the continent you need to use the right class vehicle for the job just like you use the right weapon for the job yes the game be get old but i still find the graphic be pretty good especially at night definitely turn your shadow down to low off to increase your fps they can really hammer your cpu with 96 people run around in the same area the game can be a little buggy not usually game breaking and i hear people talk about cheater but i have be play since 2014 and i can count on one hand the number of actual cheater i have encounter this game be not pay 2 win all the weapon be very balanced and be mostly side grade if you die its probably because you be not pay attention at the end of the day i always come back to this game because it offer fps game play that no other game can it force you to really think about strategy and battlefield awareness on the grand scale if you try it and stick with it for a week or more i have confidence that you will start to really enjoy it and see all the great thing it can offer but if you just play for 2 hour and log off in frustration because you keep get kill you will just end up another salty review post on steam,pos
i have play this game for over 4 year when add first come out it be really fun at first and the raid boss perkias and eltrion make me really exit about this game it feel really good to fight the boss with your friend and guildmate not to mention the event this game have plenty of event for you to grind many of you say that this game be p2w i get to sss in pvp in season 2 without have to waste any money but you need to grind really hard so i think most of people complain about this game be p2w be just lazy player but sadly all the comment point do point out the fact that this game be get really dull and bore it just lack of fun pve pretty much stay the same imagine this you be a lvl 99 player grind for the same dungeon over and over and over again it just really boring and the pvp be full of toxic player and lagger i myself be a pve player i really hate the feeling of do the same dungeon everyday overall this game be good but it be boring when you be at late game i think they should add more dungeon and have event more frequently they player have the chance to do something beside those same boring dungeon,pos
